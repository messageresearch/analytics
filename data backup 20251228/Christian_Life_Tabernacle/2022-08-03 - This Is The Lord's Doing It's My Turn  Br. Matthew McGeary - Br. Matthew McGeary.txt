the answer lord where the world fails and the doctors fail when our own minds fail you are the answer lord we've come here tonight that we would come to your throne of grace lord that you would look down upon us with favor but even beyond that lord we don't look to you as a god that's a far off you're a god that's right here in our midst and because we have received this message lord we know that we are highly favored among women we are highly favored just as mary was highly favored your bride in this end time has received a word and been impregnated by your very word of life lord and so we come to you with thanksgiving in our heart lord just to tell you that we love you that we thank you that we worship you that we adore you all worthy is the lamb that was slain worthy is the lamb lord we thank you father that we're not worshiping a god of 2000 years ago but we're worshiping a god that's right here present amongst us who knows what we have need of lord you know the secrets of our heart lord and we ask that you had come because you were the same yesterday today and forever that you would discern the very thoughts and intents of our heart not that a man could do that but by the preaching of the word we know lord jesus that your word is sharper than to any two-edged sword lord we love you lord we thank you for the gathering we think of those that aren't with us our pastor and sister leslie pray that you be their portion lord many that aren't with us those that are sick and body are our brother burly father oh we're just looking forward to a great mighty report that there be no loss of vision lord as that nail went into his eye from that nail gun oh lord you know in my heart i cried out lord and we cry out together father you said we have not because we asked not lord we're asking that there would be no vision impairment lord there would be a quick healing father that there would be a great testimony that would go forth of your healing virtue lord how we love you how we thank you lord and right now we know that we're seated in the place where all things are possible father and expectation in our heart is rising up even now to know that you have something special for your people we love you lord we commit the preaching of the word to you lord in ourselves there's nothing we could do but if you would come lord break the bread of life as only you can we ask it in your most wonderful name the lord jesus christ amen and amen oh hallelujah you just feel his presence so mighty let's turn in our bibles we'll be reading out of psalms 118 i just want to continue on our thought uh this would be part three this is the lord's doing but as a subject i want to speak to you it's my turn we're reading out of psalms 118 verse 21 through 23. amen i like a midweek service i think it's perfectly placed there right in the middle of the week sometimes it's a struggle sometimes it's a fight but you know it's a greater blessing if you ain't gotta fight for something you know the reward might not be so great but when you gotta fight for something you know uh we we i don't know about you but around my house when things just start going haywire and the kids might be screaming it seems like the atmosphere is getting a little heavy and it just seems like we're having a hard time getting there there's something on the inside goes get ready it's going to be a good one is there somebody that had to fight to get to the house of god was it a struggle mate maybe you didn't even know if you'd be able to make it but there was something inside of your drawer and you poisoned oh i'm going to make it to the house of god well then god has something for you so we're going to look past the veil we're going to look past man and we're going to see what god has to say amen just reading out of psalms 118 verse 21 it said i will praise thee for thou has heard me and are become my salvation the stone which the builders refuse has become the headstone of the corner this is the lord's doing and it is marvelous in our eyes you may have your seats and also if you will turn with me to hebrews chapter 11 it's almost difficult to pick a spot to read in hebrews 11. you just want to read the whole thing but we're going to pick up uh in hebrews uh 11 chapter uh hebrews chapter 11 verse 32. it's good to that brother yance with us amen maybe we'll get a chance to shake your hand afterwards it says is everybody there hebrews 11 verse 32 through 40. it says and what shall i more say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barrick and of samson and jephthah and of david also in samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouth of lions oh we we could stop right there and just preach for a little bit but by faith they obtained promises god has given you something that the world knows nothing about there's a sixth sense of faith that when you hear a promise laying in the word you have an ability to obtain that promise there there's a special gift a gift of revelation given to the believer that when you hear the word you hear the message there's something in you that can obtain that for yourself stop the mouth alliance quench the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight turn to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead rays to life again others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection just listen to that women received their dead rage life and others were tortured not accepting deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection you know many times uh you know we we feel like this life that we're living if it ever feels like it's becoming cumbersome to you and you feel like you just want to let off the pressure a little bit why why can't i just go out and uh mess around with the things of the world why do the preachers uh preach so hard against these things you realize that there there was there was brothers and sisters who have gone before us who were being tortured in ways we would be hard for us to even understand how our babies were ripped from their stomachs and they were boiled and tar was poured on them and their hair was set on fire and and that was placed before them but they esteemed something greater there was something in them and there was a resolve that said look uh uh there's something greater than my deliverance in the flesh there's such something greater than a liberty to live any kind of way i want to there's a greater resurrection and others had trials of cruel mockings and scourge and jay moreover of bonds and imprisonments they were stoned they were sawn asunder where tempted were slain with the sword they wandered about in sheepskins and goat skins being destitute afflicted and tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having something some better things for us that they without us should not be made perfect why would a what a wonderful representation of the saints that have gone uh before us through by faith they endured scourgings and and trials and mockings and they wandered the deserts and and and and sheepskin and clothing and and they refused to be delivered what a what a great uh exhortation paul is showing us in the scriptures and i just want to read this quote as we've been reading this as we've been on this subject the prophet of god would say in expectancy in 53 said now no matter what the opposition looks like christ is the answer faith brings christ notice could you remember 80 years old white beard white hair and yet the old man went around telling people that he wasn't going to die until he's seen the lord's christ what a beautiful picture of faith faith knows no defeat faith is perfect faith brings things when there is no things to be brought faith creates faith takes doubt away takes negative and makes it positive or i just like that that's been speaking to my heart how faith takes the negative and makes it a positive we know that this scripture would open up in hebrews 11 verse one would say now faith is the substance of things hoped for it is the evidence of things not seen and paul would go on to say in galatians 3 6 he would say even as abraham believed god and it was accounted to him for righteousness now know ye therefore that they which are of faith the same are the children of abraham is there anybody here that are of faith that are the children of abraham look faith takes the negative and makes it a positive. i like that how abraham the father of our faith see see what what appeared to abraham as abraham was given the promise that you're going to have a son it seemed like with every week and with every month that passed by and then with every year that had gone by as five years turned into ten and ten turned into twenty it would seem that would be a negative but faith will take the negative and turn it into a positive now i don't know about you but i've been dealing with some negative things and if you're living in lady you'll see you then there's going to be negativity all around you there's going to be negativity in your work there's going to be negativity in your job there's going to be negativity when you go to the grocery store there's negativity at the gas pump there's negativity in the news there's negativity in the media everywhere you go there's negativity everywhere but the believer has an advantage that the world knows nothing about because there is a faith inside of the believer that knows with all of these things going out there i can take all of the negative and know that there is a positive that is coming forth in my life abraham could look at sarah and say sarah do you feel any different do you feel any better no i feel just the same praise god and five years would go by abra uh sarah do you feel any different no i don't feel praise god it's just five years more a miracle see faith took what seemed to be a negative faith took what looked like defeat faith looked like what the obstacle was faith took that and said that's just a greater miracle where's faith resting place it's in the word of god so you're not limited to time oh praise god we're not limited at the time praise god we're not limited to our thinking praise god we're not limited to our own ideas faith is not limited to the five senses faith isn't limited to what your mind can come up with faith's resting place is in the word of god if i can get a little bit more on the monitor just a little bit the prophet would say this and perseverant he'd say glory to god we're going to have a baby anyhow get the booties ready all the bird eye and the pens and everything get ready we're going to have it well how do you know we're going to have it god said so the second month passed how you feeling sarah no different glory to god it's another month greater miracle oh my hallelujah your past how you feeling dear no different glory it's a year greater and 25 years past how you feel and sarah old and feeble how you feeling no different dear glory to god it's 25 years more a miracle now we're talking about faith faith is the evidence faith is a substance that the believer possesses where you can look the symptoms right in the face and say god said so then doctor if you're telling me that's how bad the symptoms are that means that's how much greater the miracle is going to be if you're telling me my womb's dried up and there's no way i can have a baby if you're telling me my husband's still i don't care what the doctor said i've received a divine promise from god that i'm going to have a baby so every symptom the devil pours on you every time the devil tries to throw that in your face and try to tell you you went through the prayer line you got prayed for you believed god you spoke the word you did this you did that that was eight years ago that was ten years ago that was fifteen years ago i don't care that just means it's 15 years more a greater miracle don't tell me i don't know what i'm talking about we have a sister sitting right amongst us who i believe had her first child at the age of 52. our god knows what he's doing he's always right on time face final resting place is the word of god it's just a greater miracle glory to god somebody ought to just start singing and shouting you've been really going through it for a little while and you didn't realize that you're just getting ready for a greater miracle oh my you thought you were being tortured you thought you were being beat down you just thought you you you were never gonna get the victory but really what's happening is god is just going to bring forth a greater miracle in your life well let's just hear what the prophet had to say about it and we say we're abraham's seed uh huh we got the holy ghost well i was prayed for last night but i sure didn't get healed you're a poor excuse for abraham's seed abraham called those things which were not as though they were amen hallelujah for he believed that what god had promised god was big enough to keep his word well i want to read that again he said you're a poor excuse for abraham's seed abraham called those things which were not as though they were hallelujah for he believed that what god had promised god was big enough to keep his word now i just want to say we got to get our eyes off of the flesh we need to get our eyes off the things of the world and start to think about is god big enough to keep his word my god is big enough to keep his word if he made the promise my god is big enough i don't care the symptoms i don't care the calamity i don't care the trial i don't care the doctor's report i don't care how bad bad it looks i know that my god is big enough he will back up his word and my duty and my responsibility is to stand fast upon that word and say god said so look that old devil right in the face my god's big enough to back up his word the doctor tries to tell you you're going to die the doctor tries to tell you this is the way it's going to be you can stare right back at that doctor tell them no that's not the way it's going to be and even if it was that way my god's still faithful well it reminds me of that sister uh that that that her colleagues came around and she started to testify to him and say look she they said oh there's nothing to that william branham and she said now wait a second i might be dying on my deathbed but i've been around too long let me just tell you a little bit i've seen it time and time again and it's never failed if i could just get him to come back and pray for me oh there's nothing to it there's nothing to that message there's nothing to that prophet you haven't heard of all the false reports and she started to stick up and she started to testify for the for the message of the hour the prophet of god says it's about three o'clock in the morning i was getting a glass of water or something and the angel came through the door and said you go tell i don't know if it's sister webber uh you go tell sister that i heard what she said and thus saith the lord she is healed look god is listening to your confession confession is made unto salvation you want to put the words look what did the word come to do it came to restore our heart and the scripture says the word is naive even in thy mouth and in that heart we've got to take that word that has been restored in our heart and start speaking the word oh glory to god speak the word church what does the word say about it my god's big enough to keep his word my god's big enough to keep his promise and even if he's not just like the hebrew children even if he doesn't deliver us o king our god is faithful and we're not going to bow to your image i'm not going to bow to lady osea i'm not going to bow to the internet i'm not going to bow to my job my job tells me to work on sunday i will not bow i don't know about you i can only speak for myself let me live under a bridge let me drink soda a branch water and soda crackers i have a thus saith the lord in my heart look look if your faith don't bring you into that place i'm sorry that's okay i'm not condemning you i'm just saying that's the way god made me look as a young christian uh uh they they brought me up to the president of uh parking cars in dallas and you know they i told him look i don't work on sunday i was such a fanatical i quit working on saturdays because you know parking cars in dallas you're doing it for restaurants and things you're working late i told them look i don't work past 11 59 on saturday that might have been a little bit more i might have been using the word to my advantage there but i just something to me i don't work on sunday so i remember i worked there for about a year or so and they came and got me to say oh by the way it's easter sunday you got to work well i don't work on something well we know but we've been so good to you matthew we've never even made you work one sunday you've been here oh you've been with us and everything but we're all we're asking is for just one and i said well i i don't wear sundays he said all right well then you're gonna have to take it up with the president of the company i said that's fine so so brian brought me up to rp he was the uh the owner of the company you know this out in turtle hill in dallas you know go up this eight nine story i can't remember how you go up high with a big view over dallas and he's in his big chair and his big desk in his office and there's brian standing there you know he brings me up and i sit down i was like i said yes r.p what can i do for you guys well brian informed me that you're not um that you're you're having a a problem about working sunday for us and you know we've been good to you and and uh you know it's mandatory that that everybody works this easter we've never asked you before but this is mandatory so if you don't work uh you have to work it i said rp i completely respect that i just need you to let me know what i need to do uh um do i need to quit are you going to fire me because i'm not working on sunday and in that moment they realized i could tell that that president he wasn't expecting that answer and he had to be quick on his feet because he realized that that i wasn't subject to his authority oh hallelujah i wasn't subject to my boss's authority because there was a greater authority over the authority of the world i have the authority of the word i can say you could fire me you can do whatever you want but the authority of the word says i don't work on sunday that's where my faith was resting in the word of god and that's not condemnation to you if you have to work on sunday that's an encouragement to tell you if you don't want to work on sunday anymore you don't have to that's all hallelujah by faith they obtained promises you have not because you ask not try god put them first watch what happens oh we're talking about we think we're tortured imagine okay matthew if you don't work on sunday tomorrow we're going to tie you to a post and burn you ain't no different church we've gotten so soft well here i go in my soapbox we've gotten so soft so vindicated so message fied we can live any kind of way and dabble in any kind of thing and just listen to the message and live any kind of way we want to live and we're going in a rapture bless god glory to god we're all saved sanctified and go are are you sanctified for how many minutes out of the day on sunday wednesday night sanctified half the time we need the holy ghost church we need the holy ghost we're not facing what those those believers faced look that's exactly what was being thrown in their face you renounce the word now tell me what part of the word is greater than another show me one place in the written word that's greater you can you can't add to it and you can't take away from it and then we think we're gonna get by what was the very fall in the very beginning one word and what has god done in the end time he's restored all the word and called a bride that would believe all that word so then if you see a portion of the word that you're not living faithful to that is not a condemnation that is god wooing to you and telling you don't worry i've placed something inside of you that can obtain the promise of the word and bring it into manifestation i'm just wanting you to step out by faith oh lord if that be you bid me come come on peter just start walking come on bride if you see it in the word it's for you what do you got need of what do you want tonight if you see it there come on what is it you've been praying for what is it you've been believing for what is it you've been asking for the holy spirit is here has been you come on step out of the boat some of us have just gotten too comfortable in our little boat we're just going along just fine and we don't want to step out by faith but god is calling to an elect people and say come on it's time to step out by faith it's time to speak the word it's time to see these promises and these prophecies that have been spoken by malachi 4 taking on flesh oh that makes me excited look with men it's impossible but with god for with god all things are possible we're not appealing to your flesh we're not asking you to produce something in your mind or in your intellectual abilities that's not what we're after no you'll fall short every time how many have you fallen flat on your face and you've tried over and over again and maybe you have a descending set of be setting sin in your life it's time to get serious say you know what i cleaned up for six months a year i find myself falling back to the same trap now satan wants to continue condemn you for that but what's the purpose of testing to see if you can pass the test has anybody ever failed a test in school why did you fail the test she didn't know what you're talking about so what do you have to do you got to take the test over again so that's the purpose of it we know who we are in the word but yet there but god is wanting that knowledge to become a revelation it has to become more than just an intellectual conception it has to become more than you know you see it laying in the word but you but you but you but you know that you need something greater to pull you into that manifestation that's not so you can just sit back here and beat a feed and say i'll never get there but it's god showing you that look i have more for you and so when you come up against the test and you come up against the trial and you fail again then you have a higher appeal say oh god you're the high priest that's touched by the feeling of my affirmative lord forgive me i've failed you yet again but i keep failing every time i come to this test lord and you seek god's face for the answer in your life and many times you know what you come to find out the reason you keep following to that besetting sin is because it's another area of your life satan likes to set up strongholds satan likes to be able to attack you in such a way where he can take a portion of your life and make you compromise maybe not in such a bad way maybe not in such an evil way might be in your prayer life it might be with reading your bible he might get you to compromise in such a way where you've kind of slacked over here and then when you run out on the battlefield you keep coming up against this and you keep falling and you keep wondering why you're falling and maybe what you got to come back to in the real life is you got to come back to your abc's and realize that you've forsaken some of the basic principles of a christian life how you got to read your bible and there's one thing you can never do too much is pray i say oh god help me to pray that's that's been in my heart lord i want a better prayer life oh god seems that lady will see it with everything pressing all around and the buzzing of the world and then the city around it just sometimes seems so hard to get away and break away into his presence when's the last time you got along with god and the world drifted away and the presence of god started to move in you started to feel his presence you started to feel the atmosphere change you started to feel a channel open up you started to feel something that you hadn't felt in a while and it just seemed like the heaviness of life just started to lift and the cares and the burdens started to fall away and all of a sudden you're in an atmosphere you're in a presence and you start weeping and you feel his arms wrapped around you and something you can't even explain is taking place oh if you could get to that place i invite you you come to a place where you meet god on those sacred sands not just once i want to say coming into the presence of god and and having a sacred sands experience is so powerful it'll change your life forever you will you will never be the same and because of that you can go a long time but but i want to caution you why would you do that oh when you when you come to know the lord and your youth and god does such a wonderful work we're not even preaching anything we would come to preach but somebody's pulling something when you when you come to when you come to god and you have that that new birth experience and the burden of sin is lifted and you're just soaring in the heavenlies oh and you're just ready to take on the world and you're testifying and you're doing the things that you know to do it's often many times we forget what brought us into that place we got desperate we got before god we started to to cry out to god's hell god i need your help oh god i need you to come on the scene why would we sell ourselves short that while we're on the mountaintop that's the time praise them worship them give them glory it it's in those moments many times when you feel free in your spirit and and you're doing just fine and nothing's wrong we just keep going through life and then all of a sudden we hit the ditch and we wonder why we ought to take advantage of those moments we ought to take advantage of the time that that we're feeling good that things are going we feel we're on the mountaintop why would we allow ourselves to go one year or six months or two weeks from from seeking his face and coming into his presence oh with god all things are possible no matter how dark it gets we we ministered about uh uh you know this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes how how many times your faith takes the negative and makes it a positive you know we might understand not understand what the lord is doing it might it might look like a negative we might not understand what the trial means but by faith we can stand like job and say oh the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord the lord can take whatever trial it is and give god glory and say this is the lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes and and we moved a little bit on it we we spoke about uh wounded but still fighting and how no matter how impossible things look or whatever the trial that you're going through we know that god is in control that we can stand there and say this is the lord's doing look that doesn't take away the pain that doesn't take away the hurt that doesn't take away the suffering but it's in that trial it's in that moment what we're speaking about is being wounded but still fighting and as david would say there in psalms 42 1 he said as the heart pantheth after the water books so pantheth my soul after thee o god remember what he said no matter what the opposition is christ is the answer if that deer didn't get to water it would die and that's the same thing for the believer if you don't get to the water if you don't get to christ you're going to die especially when you've been wounded or you've been hurt we were dealing with how easy it is for you to want to lay down your sword how easy it is for you to want to give up how easy it is for you to want to go to the entertainment of the world or sometime after a hard day at work you get home and you just you just want to unwind and it's easy for us to want to unwind in our mind with the things of the world but we should unwind in our heart with the things of god hey we're all guilty of it we're wounded and when you're wounded you're thirsty you've got to get to water and the devil's always there to offer a substitute well just a little this just take your mind off of this don't even worry about it they said this they say you heard what happened at church you heard what the preacher said they were talking about you why don't you just watch this or get on this little go over to your friend's house just just don't even worry about just take your mind off of it and you'll find yourself in greater condemnation because you heeded the word of the devil but it's those times that you need a drink we say oh god i need a drink from the fountain oh god i need to unwind all my spirits and say the lord let me come to my bible let me come to my prayer closet let me put on a tape oh god let me seek your face oh as the deer el pantus after the water book sow my soul pantheth after thee oh god first peter 4 12 would read like this beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice in so much as ye are partakers of christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding joy we heard about singing a new song sunday night that was the only service i was here for flew in didn't get the morning but i went back and listened to a good portion of it wonderful word i want to say faith gives you a new song just like job can say look the lord in that calamity in that trial the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord there was an anchor just like brother branham when the black sheep came down and he was ready to give up look all the things the devil are saying are true uh i i stood on the field i've preached and now i've lost my wife i lost my baby i lost my brother all these things that the devil is telling me and he's trying to tell me that god don't love me he come too late to tell me he wasn't real but he's telling me you don't love me because and here in the moment that i need him more than i've ever needed in my life here's a black sheep that that's dropped down and if that's the way he's going to be that i'll just and something caught what was it look faith is not something that you muster up faith is an attribute of god faith is a gift lest any man can boast faith is that anchor that in that moment and in that trial that it anchored to the word and said oh the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the lord look faith gives you a new song that in the trial and in the suffering you can rejoice knowing that in that much that you are partakers of christ's suffering i was thinking along those lines about the the spies at cades barnea they went over and they said they we be as grasshoppers because they were lacking what was needed to possess the promised land they were lacking faith in what the prophet had said they were lacking faith and thus saith the lord god give them the land therefore they were able to take it but since they lacked faith in the word they weren't able to take it but joshua and caleb had a different song while everybody else what was was complaining and and you know you brought us out here to die we can't even go in there we'd be as grasshoppers to them there's giants in the land and what did caleb have to stand there and do and steal the people say what are you talking about i'm singing a different song i'm singing a different tune because there's something inside of me that's not looking at the flesh realm that's like looking at the circumstances you might see giants over there and walled cities and chariots of iron but i am looking at thus saith the lord i'm looking at a divine promise of god that said ye shall take the land now what about your healing what about your daughter what about your son what about your trial what about your healing what about what about it come on somebody what about it what are you looking at faith is there to declare faith calls those things which are not as though they are i don't care how many giants are in the land i don't care how bad the symptoms are i'm not going to sing that song i'm singing another song that god is faithful who made the promise oh glory to god thank god for faith hallelujah oh my that's it we be as grasshoppers brother branham mentions you know it's not the size he went to that stadium and that he read that little uh saying on the stadium wall said it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog i don't know how well that translates israel might not have been able in number or in strength or in weapons to match up against the inhabitants of canaan you in your abilities and in your mind and in your in what you can perceive you might not be able to match up against the devil but i'm so thankful it's not the size of the dog in the fight it's the size of the fight in the dog and you realize that fight that is on the inside of you is a very gene seed of god that's why you can't quit that's why you can't back up that's why you can't lay down there is a gene seed of god that is inside of you oh if you only knew how big that fight was that that that faith will lay hold of god's promise it'll never let it go even when your mind fails you even when all of your reason and all the doubt and everything just seems to to give in there is something greater than all of that that will never let hold of that promise well what is the name of the brother cartwright i believe he was going to hold himself a revival god told him to go holy revival as you know he was over there washing the windows and everything just a little bitty guy and the bully of the town say what's this guy doing what's that preacher over there doing he's going to hold a revival wait come on down i think peter cartwright told him hey you're not going to hold no revival in my town he come down say what are you doing well i'm washing windows what for well i'm going to hold me a revival no you ain't not unless you go through me first well if that's what i got to do next so what did he do he turned around he grabbed him by the collar he started to beat the car out of him he said if i must fight if i must reign and crease my courage lord and he with the beating the tar out of them i think that's what some of us christians need to do to the devil the devil's just been a big old bully it's just been a big old bluff and you need to take the word of god and start pounding that devil back you've robbed me of my joy you've robbed me of my peace you've robbed me of my family you've robbed me of my victory well i don't know about you but i don't like being bullied i don't like being pushed around but you know the devil gots his targets on you and if you give him an inch he'll take it and anymore he'll take whatever you give him and peter cartwright could have just packed his bags and said oh i just thought it was the will of the lord but maybe he meant another town maybe he he may i'd be healed at the change of my body maybe he i'll have all of my family in heaven don't you back up off of god's uh a promise you know god don't let him bully you like that you say if that's what i got to go through next then come here old devil i'm to pound you with the word of god i'm going to pound you with thus saith the lord i'm going to pound you with these signs shall follow them back believe they shall lay hands on the sick they shall recover they shall cast out devils in my name you're going to beat that old devil with the word of god he's just a bluff the prophet of god says sometimes god lets things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and he comes and makes a way through it for you that you might say look at this this is beautiful sometimes god lets things get so dark that you can't see up around or anywhere else and then he comes and makes a way through it for you that you might say this day this scripture is being fulfilled that he promised to do now we're just coming to my inspiration so i was just brother ed biskull just recently uh had their 50th anniversary meetings and i was listening to brother ed uh give his testimony about when he had called brother ron spencer maybe would just be another 40 minutes if that'll be okay an hour to it's your fault but i was listening to him give this testimony and i i just this really struck my heart because as as as he was testifying he said he called brother ron spencer and was asking him for prayer because brother i believe brother ed at the time was going through some heart procedures and he said he said he made this statement he said wow he's speaking of brother ron spencer was praying for brother biscuit he called him for prayer called brother ron spencer for prayer he said while he was praying i thought i'm gonna hang on to these words because it's my turn the woman at the well it was her turn but now this is my turn now something in my heart anchored in that because here brother you know you could just think of of you know many times the pastor he's he's standing in the gap and and and many times he's standing between the people you know and he's he's preaching and and he's he's counseling and he he's doing many things and many times the burden of the word upon the man is so demanding and and many times giving of himself and we know that's for all of us that doesn't mean anything about that you know the the we know eternal life is living for others that's we're all living for others and but in this moment he he had a need and he said now this is my turn and i wanted to say that's it that needs to be the attitude this is my turn this is my opportunity look the woman at the well she had her turn but now it's my turn i don't want you to say that god god has something special for you uh god is doing something for you and the devil is trying to keep you from what god is doing for you your joy is your your peace is yours healing is yours revelation is yours this message is yours the devil wants to take this message from you try to tell you that it was just another prophet try to try to tell you that there's mistakes in it no when you get the revelation of who it was you could see past the veil and you can see it was none other than our lord standing there it was malachi 4 5 luke 17 30. it was the revelation of the son of man it was the son of man ministry what did they see when moses came they saw a man but what did the scripture say i have come down and he said i have come down what was it it was god coming down and going in the form of a man so when you hear that voice i am just a mute like the microphone this microphone oh glory to god this microphone doesn't have a voice but when he comes in and steps behind it then it's god speaking now look we're mature enough that we don't fall into the the the the ignorant traps of wondering well you know well you know what was brother branham you know people people seem to be incapable recognizing brother branham was our brother subject to mistakes and like passions but i love how transparent and the way god does things because it shows us that the way he dealt with the prophet and the way he brought him into maturity that the way he'd be standing in the house and he'd be so uh weighed down by a tax case that when they would call that he said well just tell him i'm not here and he'd run out you're talking about a son of god coming into maturity coming into position taking ownership of his actions to know that he was going down to pray for some baby or pray from some sick case and he said you know what i'll be back i have to go make something right now god don't have to make anything right but the man who made the mistake had to go back and what's that showing us that's just showing us the an example we've received a message we've received the word we know we can't fall we know we're predestinated not to fall because there's a faith seed that's keeping us that won't let go of the word but god is bringing that word into a maturation into a perfection in our life that when we speak it's god speaking and so when we get out of line of the word those i love i rebuke and chasten so the prophet realized look in this condition i need to go back and make that right so that when i speak my words as good as his word and that's the maturity that god is wanting to bring us to that we can be so surrendered to the power of god so surrendered to our ideas and what the world wants to say about it that we can come so surrender to this message that the god of the message the same one that would speak through the prophet could come and take your vessel that's what god wants to do doesn't the scripture say ye are gods why christ speak the word you realize we're coming into maturity we're coming into something that the world's never seen [Music] well they saw it in christ jesus they saw a manifestation of an adopted son in the prophet but that was a a first one to maturity a first one in the field showing that there's many more suns coming into that same maturity why would you ever stop short of the fullness of the opening of the word being manifested in your life so the woman at the well had her turn and the prophet of god would say oh we just need to skip some things he's saying possessing all things i'm heir of all things amen it's given to me i'm heir i can claim everything that god's promised me amen there you are it's mine how do you get it something you've done no sir it's a merited gift that god gave us and it's ours it belongs to us satan cannot hold it if you go to him with the scriptural authority of word with faith to say it's mine lay it down i like that satan you lay it down you took it from me you give it back because i'm serving notice on you i was thinking about that i know i've used this quote the last three times i preached or so i was thinking about that you ever watch a kid that you know another kid comes and takes their toy i'm talking about a younger kid who maybe hasn't you know all they know is that's mine and oh my you you think something crazy happened and you run in there with a that's mine give it back he's like what do you talk about he took it from took what that was my cheerio well look that might sound silly but i think some of us ought to act that way if a little child can get upset about a little cheerio and why are they upset because it's theirs now why would us why would you let the devil come and take any promise from you why would you let him come and rob you of your joy why would you come and let them rob you of your peace why would you let them take your daughter or your your son out there in the world and make you feel all bad about it make you lose your joy make you lose your peace uh make you lose your your peace and your family i think it's time that you might just get a little upset and say ah you're the devil that's mine give it back and what do some of them kids do especially if they're a little bigger you got to teach these kids they'll go take it back you know that's what we're supposed to do as sons and daughters of god that's what the problem the devil is taking something from you you got a right to scream out in the name of the lord and say give it back that's mine god gave it to me god gave me my church god gave me my family god gave me my son god gave me my daughter god gave me my health god gave me my wife god gave me my peace god gave me my joy god gave me my salvation god gave me the holy ghost god gave me victory in my life and ain't no devil ain't nobody gonna take my joy away from me oh i'm gonna scream i'm gonna shout i'm gonna praise god i'm gonna be victorious i'm gonna lift this message i'm gonna be free i'm gonna set my wings and fly like an eagle above all the chaos above all the sin above all the sickness in the world it's mine give it back the devil comes and tries to tell you you ain't got the holy oh shut your mouth devil you ain't gonna go in there shut your mouth devil god gave it to me we're speaking about it's my turn isaiah 59 would say when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of the lord shall lift up a standard against him where's that standard being lifted where is that standard being lifted up at least i want to say lord speaking about even in the negative and the positive tribulation sickness long-suffering you know in war they would they would call them the flag bearer or they'd even call them the standard bear and they would have a responsibility of carrying the colors and there was a a chosen group of people that no matter what happened in battle if that flag ever started to go down they would never let that standard go down and so they would be bearing the flag and if he'd be wounded or he'd be struck and that flag would start to go down somebody else would grab that flag knowing it's one of the most defenseless positions knowing that you're now a target for the enemy well just let god speak a little bit to you when you get baptized and you profess this message you are now a target for all of hell and now you are holding up the standard you see when that flag would start to go down the person that's elected and chosen that's next there they would grab that standard in that word and they would lift it up and say now it's my turn it's my turn to carry the message it's my turn to run with the message it's my turn to bear the cross it's my turn now just for a few moments the prophet of god would say this in the church age book as the eternal logos god was manifested in the sun i just i just pray by the help of the holy spirit if if if we could just bind together by faith i believe god has something special for us if we could just maybe uh uh uh be just united in our faith for just a few moments uh as the eternal logos god was manifested in the sun and in jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily i want to take my time with this because i really want you to i really want us to catch it so as the eternal logos maybe if we can put that up i would really um i like kentucky grammar better just well you know if you know what i mean i just understand it better sometimes sometimes the church age book you know there's a word in there too you're like well i know he didn't say that as the eternal logos god are we finding that we're working on it well maybe we read it twice as the eternal logos god was manifested in the sun and then jesus dwelt all the fullness of the godhead bodily and that eternal one was the father manifest in flesh and thereby gained the title of son even so we now notice what the prophet's doing now even so we so he's showing the very thing the very way that god was manifested in christ jesus even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many-membered spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifest in the flesh are the sons of god even as we are so called so you are the body of christ you are the bride of jesus christ so just as christ was manif the manifestation of the spoken word you are the literal spoken word seed bride you say what does that mean brother what are you trying to say so notice just as god the logos was manifested in the flesh gaining the title of son there comes our turn for the word to be manifested in our flesh and that manifestation is the spoken word see bride or the body of christ in a church age book he goes on to say those in the bride do only his will so what does that mean if jesus christ was that word made flesh and you are that word made flesh those in the bride do only his will no one can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the lord or they keep still they know that it has to be god in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while in his earthly ministry so now where is he working now he works in and through the ride she knows that for it was not yet time for him to do certain things that he must do now that he must now do but he will now fulfill through the bride that work which he left for this specific time what does that mean it's god in you it's god in you it's god fulfilling his own word in you and through you i'm taking my time notice as god the logos was manifested in jesus in the flesh even so we his eternal thoughts in our turn became the word manifested in the flesh and our turn now now here's a little of my inspiration if we could just by god's grace move through here real quick in our turn what did we read in our opening text was in hebrews we read about all the patriarchs and all those that went through before and by faith and by faith look abel by faith offered a more excellent sacrifice under god than cain abel had his turn enoch by faith was translated and he had this testimony he pleased god look enoch had his turn oh glory to god don't you write what was he it was the word being manifested in them job job was sitting there in his trial but it was in that trial in that moment that job had his turn to bring forth the revelation that by that revelation of him saying look though the skin worms destroy this body though they eat up this flesh i know that i'm going to stand and see my redeemer and it was by that revelation that abraham and then all the patriarchs buried their bones because they knew that's where the resurrection was going to be he had his turn what did what did the when everything was going on said job where were you when the sons of god shouted for joy i want to say it like this when when moses met the logos there the pillar of fire in the burning bush where were you i want to say i was there but i was just waiting my turn it was moses's turn when moses and the and the lord and the pillar fire come down and split the red sea and they walked upon dry land i was there i wasn't in the flesh but i was there i have to be because i'm identified when manna fell from the sky and they ate manna in the wilderness i was there but what was i doing i was waiting for my turn oh glory to god oh and moses struck the rock and water came forth and they drank from the rock i was there and as the prophet would say and i'm still drinking tonight yes i was there but i was waiting for my turn oh glory to god hallelujah and i just want to say this eve had her chance at the word you know the prophet of god said every generation has a chance at a word at the word they have a chance at a revival and when eve had her chance oh just let well let's preach for a little bit now we're on the home stretch eve had her chance at the word and when when when satan came to her she had a chance to stand for the word and turn down satan's lie but when she was given the chance she turned the word of god down and she failed and because of that because adam and he fell it brought forth every death it brought forth every sickness and every time man came that's what job was talking about lord i see every time i see the life going to the ground and in the springtime the life comes back out in the trees but where is the resurrection for man see job had to go by the way of the grave david had to go by the way of the grave many of the patriarchs they had every single one of them went by the way of the grave except for a few that we know of enoch and elisha and moses body being taken away and hidden but every time man had their turn to face death every one of them went by the grave but i was excited as i thought about this in my heart that there came one man as god built back his masterpiece and there stood his great masterpiece in jesus christ standing upon the earth what was he doing there in his first ministry he was coming to pay the penalty for sin and all i was just thinking of how he come to face that horrible death on the cross and there the devil said aha come is time for dying i got him now i finally got them now when i was just rejoicing in my heart i thought about as there as the lord i laid down his life there on calvary and he paid the price and you can imagine the imps in hell and satan and all them like well we were really scared there for a moment you know he did raise the dead he did open some blind eyes he did perform some miracles on earth that we had never seen but we finally got him now no man has ever been able to cheat the curse we got them now oh maybe devil was just celebrating the devil in his imps we'll celebrate there in hell on the first day and the second day and on that third day there come a little knock who is that who could that be i don't know and i just imagine the devil went over there and he opened up the door and he looked like he saw a ghost and the lord jesus was standing there and i just imagined him looking at the devil he said it's my turn it's my turn and he ripped the keys off of the side slammed the door on him and he left captivity captive oh there was a great resurrection and he ascended on up into glory oh it's my turn and because jesus christ took his turn oh glory to god why was i waiting for mine because god saw fit that he'd place you in ladies his very eternal thoughts that he had of you oh moses had his turn abel had his turn enoch had his turn david had his turn peter james and john paul brother branham they all had their turn but now it's your turn to manifest the message oh glory to god hallelujah i'm excited about that look i'm identified by the blood i'm identified by a spirit i'm identified by the word don't you know who you are this is your turn this is your house you are the eternal thoughts of god that are being manifested well that makes me excited do you know what that makes you invincible eternal victorious a mighty conqueror your bone of his bone your flesh of his flesh well if the musicians will come we won't ask him to play right away but it gives y'all hope invisible union of the bride of christ he says for you are only the physical manifestation of the attributes that was in god at the beginning for there is only one form of eternal life and that was you before you don't know nothing about it neither did you know when you were in your earthly father but you are manifested in his image in the image of god you are made and you are manifested for his glory and his fellowship of god don't let this pass you by there's a creative power in the word he is the word the woman at the well had her turn is this any different has the word lost its power or or does there need to be a physical manifestation for you to believe well if we were listening to what thus saith the lord was saying you are the physical manifestation of the word are we just playing church are we just looking back 60 70 years to to a prophet who is able to make the word live and we're incapable that's not what this message came for this message has the same power the same life the same effects the same action we're talking about the attributes of god look we we know oh we just we just we just skip we'll just move to to to our clothes here but we know that the word has been uh restored down through the ages and i just maybe want to end here i'm finding i'm i just i want to bring this home by god's help i'm really wanting something in your heart to anchor that you are the manifestation of this message and as each one played out their part and each one had their turn and even now the prophet said just as jesus christ was the logos made flesh and because he was made flesh by that he gained the title of son he says even so you even so you and your turn you were also the thoughts of god but your turn wasn't back there your turn is now god saw fit that he would manifest you what do you bypass your theophany you were with him in the very beginning and now you've come here that in your turn you would manifest the very thoughts that god had towards you for god hath commanded the light to shine out of the darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of god in the face of jesus christ but we have this treasure in earth and vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us we have this treasure what treasure what treasure are you talking about brother matthew i'm talking about the spoken word as the original seed i'm talking about the restoration of the bride tree in earthen vessels we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair why why with all hell breaking loose around us we're troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair why behold a greater than solomon is here who is this melchizedek christ the mystery of god reveal who opened those hills it was christ that opened those seals we have this treasure oh hallelujah if you could play something softly we have this treasure and earth and vessels persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed why because there's a man here that can turn on the light shalom peace always bearing our body the dying of our lord jesus that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body why the masterpiece this is your turn let's stand this day this scripture is fulfilled why are we not cast down why are we not perplexed why are we persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed why are we bearing about in our body the dying of our lord that the life of jesus christ may be made manifest in our body this day this scripture is fulfilled it is the rising of the sun yet a little while and the world seeth me no more [Music] yet ye shall see me for i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world the choosing of a bride what is the traction on the mount the rapture things that are to be future home [Music] friends i don't know about you but i'm in love with this message [Music] and and to think that it's it's your turn now it's your turn to think that everything through time has been building up [Music] has been building up into this great pinnacle who is that up there what did the voice speak to him that's our lord up there just turn it to the right i think we've come to the hour an hour the cats don't call us crying grace grace this is the coming of the lord this is the hour of judgment but to the bride it's grace [Music] grace blessed is he who is not offended in me are you offended in this message are you offended the way that god manifested this message they were offended the way that jesus came he didn't come according to their traditions he didn't come to their temples he didn't come to their priest but he came in a manger when god decided to open the seven seals [Music] when he decided to usher in the rapture the lord descending with a shout are you offended in the way that god has manifested end time prophecies blessed are you who are not offended in me lord jesus let's all just bow our heads [Music] lord jesus [Music] lord i pray that you could take a broken up sermon lord [Music] and that a revelation could strike your bride's heart that that they are the very manifestation of the spoken word of god lord i'm overwhelmed by your grace your love that despite our humanity despite our faults and our failures and our inability lord that you look past all of our unrighteousness and all of our sins lord and you'd give us this great treasure in earth and vessels lord not a treasure on books and tapes to be left on a shelf but spiritual food in due season lord that no matter
