to Fellowship around your word to be blessed and we ask father tonight that you would Grant to us a individual blessing to each of our hearts we ask it in jesus' name amen if you have your Bibles and would open with me real quick to St John the 10th chapter and very familiar verses of scripture and we'll read start with the 25th verse of the 10th chapter and he said and Jesus answered them I told you and ye believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of me but ye believe not because ye are not my sheep as I said unto you my sheep hear my voice amen and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than Allen and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand amen I am my father are one amen you may be seated I I uh we were fellowshipping at lunch over leadership and we came to this quote and I don't know if it's possible uh for the brothers to find it real quick but it's in the Sam Samaran Church age on page 155 of the church age book and and I I and and we're going to just listen to the the last part of leadership that we listen to Sunday and uh I I hope that uh we can catch this is the last sermon that brother Brandon preached to the uh before communion service uh you know I don't know um you know what brother ran knew about what lied ahead for him he made a statement one place that a man knows when he's fixing to leave the scene uh this is a tremendous message he just lays so much just out for us but I'd like to read this statement out of the smar church Age and and what we're emphasizing is is because when we start listening to the tape tonight brother Brena makes this statement this start God calls individuals I stand at the door and knock If any man any person one individual out of a thousand it might be one in a million so but he stands at the door and knocks and and so he makes this statement and listen to this closely so you can understand uh we can't take comfort in a group you know what I mean or you can't take comfort because everybody around you confesses the same thing what that we've been trying to preach in these last few Services is the individual importance of each individual having leadership by the word of God in other words each of you have got to establish Lish a relationship with the word of God where that word of God speaks to you expressly and and that's what you follow you're not influenced by the pulpit you're not influenced by the fellowship you're steadfast amen so in other words my sheep hear my voice a stranger they will not follow so they that's what we're emphasizing that that you've got to come to where you're just not tossed to and fro by every wind of Doctrine or every move that you're anchored steadfast and you know the voice and this is what the messenger tells us and it's it's beautiful and I'll try to read it the best I can notice here that Jesus by the spirit in every age addresses himself to only one person relative to the word for that age amen and and we know that unto the angel of Unto the angel of Unto the angel unto the messenger he's addressing that one individual he says to that age only one messenger for each age receives what the spirit has to say to that age so we realize that we're not in another age we've got to receive the message for our age because the message for our age is given to meet the challenge of this age he says uh the messenger of that age and that one messenger is the messenger to the true church amen he speaks for God by Revelation to the churches both true and false the message is then broadcast to all but though it is broadcast for all who come within range of the message that message is received individually by only a certain qualified group in a certain way each individual of that group is one who has the ability to hear what the spirit is saying by way of the messenger amen those who hear are not getting their own private Revelation nor is a group getting their Collective Revelation but each person Hallelujah is hearing and receiving what the messenger has already received from God Amen so it it's like you you've it's like the the body is put together by individuals who re receive the word of God and by the word of God that they receive and they follow they're fitted and joined together to produce a body and and so that's how we begin to supply so this message is called leadership and basically you could you could look at it in a lot of lights a lot of different viewpoints from what's going on but the prophet of God is basically saying to the Full Gospel businessmen to the Pentecostal church that's heard them you've got to make a choice who you're going to follow and we've got to make that choice and remember we preached a couple Sundays ago that we have to meet the challenge in other words we're coming back back to the Faith of Our fathers and the last thing that this church has to go to is the complaint that he had with the church as they begin to lose their first love so we want to certainly come back to that uh this evening so let's just take it's about 41 minutes and we should be out pretty close by uh 8:00 or just a few minutes after uh once again you're more than happy to walk through the the church building they've been sheetrocking in there uh if you're okay with the white dust um feel free I think you'll be amazed how it's starting to come together but anyway let's listen to our our messenger and take into heart what he said he's speaking to you as an individual what he has received from God that you might personally have the Revelation not your own revelation but the Revelation that God has already given God bless you this evening God's calling individuals I stand at the door and knock If any man any person one individual out of a thousand it might be one out of a million as I said few nights ago when Israel come up out of Egypt there was just two million people come and just two Milli just one two people went in one out of a million did you know that Caleb and Joshua and Jesus when he was on Earth they said our fathers eat men of the Wilderness we're keeping the traditions and we're doing this we know where we're standing he said I know your fathers eat men of the Wilderness and they're everyone eternally separated their dead when the sper comes from the male or female there's a million eggs comes there's a million germs come and out of all them little germs of the kind if it's a if it's from the Bale cow or the man or whatever it is there's just millions of germs a million germs working in there there's only one of those germs that's ordained to life for there's one egg over there fertile to meet it that's right only one egg it'll meet just like this body here sitting here and The Germ comes from God and watch that little germ come up among all these other germs and wiggle around them right on pass them go over here and find that fertile EG and and crawl right into it the rest of them dies what if it was that way with the church today one out of a million see where it would be straight is the gate Nar is the way and few there will be that'll find it because broad is a way that leads to destruction and many there will be a going in there at is that truth brother BR I don't know but I'm Miss quoting scripture see now you're ordained to life you see it if you're ordained to see it if you're not ordained to see it you won't see it said they have eyes but they can't see ears and can't hear how thankful you should be Church how you should straighten yourself up from these things how you should be on fire for God that your eyes beholds what you see your ear shars the things you see leadership why did you come here tonight to hear a message like this branded across the world by the churches as a IC why did you come the Holy Spirit Led you here to listen circumcised cut away the things of the world except the leadership of Jesus Christ or you'll perish as sure as the world you have a choice of conduct how you conduct yourself that's up to you you have a choice of wife you go out and take your wife you want to take a wife you want to take one it's complimentary to your to what you what you plan your future home to be could you imagine a man a Christian man going out and taking one of these modern rickettes for a wife could you imagine what's a man thinking about what kind of homes he go to have he takes a strip teas a bur ass off of the street out here a street prostitute Bo say now wait a minute how does she dress herself am wear shorts and they say street prostitute oh you say now brother all them little old tight skirts look like you're poured into street prostitute Jesus said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her in his heart then he's got to answer for that and what she do she present herself who's guilty amen think of it you say they don't make any other clothes they got goods and sewing machines no excuse exactly God don't want to hurt you and this is not a joke this is thus sayeth the Lord from the scriptures it's exactly true friend amen I'm an old man I haven't got much longer to stay but I've got to tell you the truth if this is my last message it's the truth see don't sister don't brother and you fellow that's hanging on to a Creed and knowing the word of God being Vindicated right before you the baptism of the Holy Ghost and these realities that we have today and then because of your Creed turn away from him amen how can you be a Son of God and deny the word of God that's predicted for this last days that we're living in how can you do it how can the Bible call this as I said last night about a a king one time down in the South when they had the color down there was sold for slaves well there's no more than just a a used car market you get a bill of sales on I was alarmed at a little place I read one day where a a broker come along to buy some and he said well now I'd like they sad you'd have to whip them make them work because his way from home they're sold slaves and they in a foreign country they know nothing about and never be back home again and they were sad you had to whip him make them work but this broker come by a certain Plantation one young follow there his chest out chin up he didn't have to whip him he was right up he kept the morals the rest of up the broker said I'll buy him he said he's not for sale don't you ain't go buy him because he's not for sale he said well what makes him so much different he said is he the ball shoulder rest them said no said do you feed him different said no he's a slave eats out there in the galley with the rest of him so what makes any so much difference he said I wondered myself to have found out over in Africa where they come from where the borers bought them and brought them over here and sold them for slaves over there his father is a king of the tribe and yet an alien away from home he knows he's the son of a king so he conducts himself that way hallelujah what a rebuke hallu to Christianity we're supposed to represent God in eternal life there's only one form of eternal life and that's God he alone has eternal life and we are products of his because we're James of his Spirit then we should conduct ourselves women and man like the Bible said for us to do not JZ bells of the street and Ricky of the organization but Christian gentlemen Sons and Daughters of God born to the spirit of God manifesting the light in our days and scattering it exactly right How Far We've drifted from it why the same thing this boy did here he rejected and refused eternal life because it would cost him his soul social standing it cost him his Li his his U uh luxury of money it cost him his Fellowship in the church it cost him a lot of things he knew what it was going to cost him he was a sensible boy and he felt that he couldn't pay the price yet he thought I just trust my religion and go on but down in his heart he know there was something about Jesus Christ was different from them priest of that day and any message that's come in a genuine born message of God is different from from the old Trend when our Divine Healing went forth not long ago you notice how the impersonators followed it and every one of them right in them organization stand there did anyone know that there had to be a message follow that while God don't entertain us he attracts our attention but something and when he attracts our attention then he's got his message look when he first first come on the earth and start his ministry oh young Rabbi we want you over here in our church we bring come on down here the young Prophet oh we want you here come here but one day he stood up and said I and my father are one Oh my he makes your God except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you he's a vampire we have nothing to do with that them Apostles set right there thousands left him but those apostles were ordained to life he said so they couldn't explain it they believed it they stayed right with him because he said no man could do these works even the priests know that Nicodemus said we know the sanhan council that no man could do these works except it be from God see Peter on the day of Pentecost said Jesus of Nazareth a man approved of God among you God was with him look at the scriptures what the scriptures said would do Jesus said search the scriptures in them you think you have eternal life they are what testifies of me if you would have known Moses you'd know me for Moses rope that I would come in the farm that I would come in he come as a son of man he comes in three names it's God three like Father Son and Holy Ghost same God there three attributes now also uh justification sanctification Luther Martin and the and the Pentecostal same thing three attributes three stations three Church ages same thing water blood and spirit all this is go along the three elements that takes you back into the body like it brings you from your natural birth types your spiritual birth a baby's born the first things walk water next blood then life that's where you come into the kingdom of God the same way see that's where the church comes in the same way same thing now notice on these three things God has formed his forming his body now we find that in here that you have a right in your choice you choose the girl you want to marry she accepts you all right then another thing you have a choice or whether you want to live or whether you don't want to live you choose now between life and death you can live that boy had that choice he success and everything else a religious man but he know that when he spoke it of himself I've observed all these Commandments since I was a youth but he know he didn't have eternal life see and he had a choice to accept it or to refuse it and he turned it down that was the most fatal mistake he could ever made the rest of it wouldn't mounted doesn't Mount unless you take that choice now let us follow him his choosing and see where it led him to I see where he CH now look he was a he's a rich man he's a businessman he was a ruler and he was a religious man all that today would' say boy he's a genine Methodist or Baptist or a Pentecostal he's he's a real fellow real nice boy fine nothing you say about him friendly nice sociable and everything no immorals about him he didn't probably smoke drink or run around the shows and dances and whatever we'd call it today is we classic Christian but that ain't eternal life that ain't what we're talking about he might have been loyal to his church of what you probably was but you see and what did it lead him to Great popularity let's say if he was a preacher he could have been got a better church he could have been a state preser a bishop it leads you to popularity and it Le him to riches and to fame it might do the same thing today you have a great talent to sing I thought of that young man a while ago sing that song here I give that to the devil and I get back how different between him and E Presley and some of these Pat Boon in a group like that Ernie Ford them guys great singers and take their talents at god-given talents and use it to inspire the The Works of the devil that's right some great singers selling their god-given talents for Fame in this world to become somebody how could you become any more of a body and you could be a somebody than to be a Son of God I don't care if you own the whole city the whole world and you haven't accepted the leadership of eternal life of the Holy Spirit Christ how you go to who are you anyhow you're a dead mortal dead is sin and trespasses religious as you want to be as faithful as you want to be to the church preacher if you want to be in a pull pit but to turn bur down you die he was a great success he was a great success here in his life certainly we find him where we notic uh then we find this fell that he went we follow him a little bit we see he got a great successful and we following through the Bible we notice that he uh he we find him a rich man he's got such great big places he's entertaining the judge and the mayor of the city or what more he's up on top of his roof he has great Banquets and plenty of waitresses and women girls and everything else around him and there's a beggar laying at the gate named Lazarus he reeps the crumbs off to him we know the story the next thing he goes on successful just like the churches to a getting a businessman sitting here telling me right here in California that the church has to tell the labor union what to do he it's coming church and state again it's right on you see you're right in there and you take the mark of the beast not knowing it if you ever bought one of my tapes get this when I get when I get home the trail of The Serpent and you'll see where it's that see where this ends up at going home now to speak at the Lord willing it's about four hours so I couldn't keep it to one of the meeting like this I have to go up everywh the church suffers with me so long patiently notice but now you can listen to the tape sometime in your home notice this now we find out that he was a great success then we find him later till he was a greater success ESS until he said I have got so much boy he'd have made a real genuine guy this day would he even my barns is swelled out they're bursting and I've got so much to I said oh Soul take your rest but what he done at the beginning he rejected the leadership of Jesus Christ his church his intelligence his education and all had led him to a success all the Jews loved him he give to them he helped them he might have done this side or the other but you see he rejected the the the leadership of Jesus Christ to eternal life and that the Bible said he said thou fool tonight your soul is required th we find him the next place in Hell lifting up his eyes and seeing that beggar that he turned out the street in the bosoms of Abraham what a fatal mistake how that the churches had had had had had been all right in the way that they went but they still hadn't had eternal life it reminds me of a sermon I preached here not long ago a thinking man's filter you might have had it I was going walking through the woods a squirrel hunting this far and looked down and of course I can't call the cigarette company youo and there laid a a cigarette pack laying there and I just passed by looking for in the woods and I seen that package laying there and I look back again it said a thinking man's filter a smoking man's taste the start walking on through woods and holy spirit said turn and pick that up I reached down and picked it up a thinking man's filter a smoking man's taste I thought a American firm here selling death under disguiser to their own American citizens a thinking man's filter you and a smoking man's taste as it's a world fair with you Brian or BR them up there when he giving all that test how they put one cigarette and draw the across of marble and took the ri wiped up the nicotine and put it on a rat's back a white rat in seven days he a full of cancer he couldn't walk and they said you know they say a filter said it's a gimmick sells more cigarettes it takes so much nicotine to satisfy that devil that's right and when you take a filter cigarette it takes about four cigarettes to take the place of one it's a gimmick to sell you more cigarettes you cannot have smoke unless you got tar and tar you got cancer see how it is and the blind Americans looking for a rabbit to come out of a hat somewhere they fall far you can't have it it's death I don't care which way you go it's death anywh you go a thinking man's filter a thinking man wouldn't smoke at all that's rightall he's got any thoughts at all well I thought that just can apply to the churches I think has God got a filter yes and every church has got a filter that's right they fil the ones that comes in and they let a lot of death in too how could you ever draw a denomination through God's filter how could you do do it how could you draw a bob haired woman through that filter tell me how could you ever draw a woman that wears slacks through there when it's an Abomination for her to put on a garment pertains to a man see God's filter would catch her out there it wouldn't let her come in but the church has got their own filters so I say that there is a thinking man's filler that's God's word and it suits a holy man's taste that's right a holy man not a church man but a holy man's taste because it's pure Holiness unadulterated word of God there is a thinking man's filter and church member I advise you to use that one because it brings in the world and one lump of it is death one lump leavens or one little leaven leavens the whole lump whosoever shall take one word out of this or add one word to it his part will be taken from The Book of Life at the Garden of Eden what caused death and all this sorrow ever heartache every little dying baby every rattle in the throat every ambulance screaming every hospital every graveyard was because Eve doubted one word amen not all of it it just perverted it now God said man there he was to keep every word of God now that's the first of the Bible in the middle of the Bible Jesus come and he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God not just part of him everyone in the last of the Bible revelations 22 Jesus give the testimony of himself the revelation of his of the Bible is Jesus Christ and he said whosoever shall take one word out of here or add one word to it his part will be taken from the book of life and you go through that thinking man's filter you'll have a holy man's taste when you come out of there you'll have a saintly taste sister you that wear those clothes think of it you're go to you say I'm virtuous to my husband I'm virtuous to my boyfriend I'm a virtuous girl but what about that sinner looked at you when he answers for adultery who did it amen be guilty written in the word so it's but see oh be a thinking woman be a thinking man say my what if it does happen to be that way he said so and one word Can't Fail the great man told me not long go call me into his room so I'm going to lay hands on you brother BR you're ruining your ministry preaching such things I said any Ministry that the word of God will ruin ought to be ruined see he said I'll lay hands on he said you sent to pray for the sick I said Do You Believe those things brother he said no but it's not our business I said who business is it then well he said that's a pastor's business I look at the congregation that's right you see every year I pass through preaching these things and I think surely they get it next year come back is more than ever it goes to show that many are called but few are chosen the leadership is the holy spirit friend it leads you and guides you into all truth when he the Holy Ghost has come now think of that take the thinking man's filter that's the Bible not your Creed not your church you'll be lost take the thinking man's filter that's where that boy didn't think he took the church filter he become popular great man but in hell he lifted up his eyes being in torment now you take the thinking men's filter Jesus Christ the word and you'll desire a holy person's taste because it'll satisfy that if you got the holy spirit in you this satisfies it if the Holy Spirit isn't there you say well I don't think that means any difference Look What You've Done Right There same thing ' done right back in the same place now let's go a little farther father now let's take leave that man there that didn't use the thinking man's filter he refused to accept the leadership of Jesus Christ to eternal life now let us take another rich young businessman a ruler uh with the same opportunity that this man had and um except it he accepted the leadership of Christ now there's two of them in the Bible that we're going to talk about that when we see that refie said now let's take this man another rich young businessman and a ruler and he accepted the leadership the scriptures tell us about this fellow if you want to mark it down in Hebrews 11 uh 23 to 29 Moses by faith refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the afflictions of God esteeming the reproach of Christ amen greater Treasures than all the treasures of Egypt amen see he accepted eternal life Moses estem the the uh the reproach of Christ greater Treasures than all the treasures the world had Moses esteem that the greatest now this rich man didn't and Moses was a rich young ruler to become a pharaoh he was Pharaoh's son and was heir to the throne and he looked out to the impossible a bunch of mud doers a bunch of slaves but by faith he saw the promise of God through the word that his people would sojourn in a Strange Land for 400 years but would be brought out by a mighty hand and he esteemed that Hallelujah greater riches and all the treasures of Egypt for he forsook Egypt not knowing where he was going amen he was led by Christ amen he forsook and he had his foot on the throne and could been been the next Pharaoh in Egypt but he has seen the reproach of Christ the reproach to be called that odd one amen be call that fanatic to take his place with the muddobbers and the Fanatics because he seen that the hour that the scripture was promised to be fulfilled was there then and oh Church wake up can't you see the same thing tonight Hallelujah the hour that's been promised is on us Este steem the approach of Jesus Christ greater riches than all the fellowship of anything who takes father and mother Church anything else follow the leadership of the spirit let us follow this Christ for a few this Moses for a little while that did that let's watch his life the first thing when he accepted to take the reproach of Christ and forsake his education forsake all his wisdom he was taught in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and all of his popularity his throne his seler his kingship his crown everything he had he rejected and this other fell wanted it and refused Christ and this man refused that and accepted Christ and quickly what happened hallu he had to separate himself Hallelujah the word means praise our God it's too bad that we're forgetting it he rejected the Thrones and the popularity he could have had young girls by the wives by the hundreds and he could have had suppers under Egypt rule the world the world laid right at his feet and he was aired every bit of it but by looking in the scripture and seeing the day he was living in and no told that's something in him the predestinated seat of God went to work I don't care how poer you could be or how this you could be you could be a pres you could be a pastor you could be a this that or the other but at that word of eternal life but God's word has been for ordained into you and you see the thing at hand it goes to work moving out like that start coming out can get it and he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter because he esteemed the reproach of Christ greater Treasures than all the riches of Egypt or the world he Hasen that watch what he done he followed it quickly he was ousted from his people amen the people that once loved him it might cost you everything you got it might cost you your home ear it pertains to the world you'll have to separate yourself from everything that's World true true you'll have to do it Moses laid everything aside and went into the desert with a stick in his hand amen days after days passed and wonder if he thought he made a mistake no many times people start out and say oh I'll do it glory to God I'll sit let somebody laugh at you make fun of me probably I was wrong he said they that cannot stand chastisement are bastard children and not the children of God see they're worked up on the emotion see these that I talked about a while ago that Soul wasn't there to start with it was anointed with the spirit and he done all kinds oh you they when you're spirit's anointed you can it's a real genuine Holy Ghost and you can still be a devil amen or you say brother BR false prophets the Bible said in the last days to be false prophets Jesus said there sh rise false Christ amen not false Jesus is now nobody stands still for that but false Christ Christ means the anointed ones falsely anointed they are anointed but they false at the bottom of it and do great signs and wonders speak in tongues dance in the spirit preach the gospel Judas isar did iten Simeon or know our begger uh cesis prophesied balum the hypocrite sure done all the signs everything all the religious moves but you see a you put a cerer seed and a wheat seed in the same bed and pour the water down upon them and anoint them they'll both Rejoice they'll both grow by the same water The Sun Shines on the just and the unjust and the rain falls on the just and the unjust but by their fruits you shall know them how can you keep from lining up with the word hallelujah see what I mean the water falls on the just the UN is anointed Jesus said they will come to me in that day and said Lord Lord have not I cast out Devils have not I done prophesied have not I done great things in your name you say you workers of iniquity depart from me I don't even know you go into eternal hell it's been prepared for the devil and his angels what a word falsely worshiping vain striving in vain why do you do that when you don't have to do it amen why take a substitute when the heavens is full of genuine you don't have to do that now we find Moses anointed nothing could turn him back his own Brothers turned him down that didn't stop him amen he went right on Into the Wilderness prise the Lord one day out there he met God face to face with a pillar of fire hanging in a bush let Moses take off your shoes your ground you're standing on is Holy for I've heard the cries of my people and I have heard of their groanings and I remember my promise of the word and I'm coming down and we'll to send you down there to take him out certainly he met God face to face he talked with him he is commissioned by God God come right back that same pillar far and Vindicated that Prophet standing right there on the mountain am prove that it was when he Tu his hands and performed all kinds of Miracles and things oh they had the impersonators oh sure that were jambers and jambers stood right around done the same thing they did but who was the original where did it start from did it come from the word was of the hour and do you know that same thing's promised again in the last days as jambus and jamus with stood Moses so will these men of rebate mind concerning the truth in the last days to do the same thing impersonate everything right on in the same Gully hog going to its watering a dog to its vomit you Pentecostals that come out of them organizations years ago and cursed them your fathers and mothers and you turned right back around and done the same thing that they did and now just the same water and vomit right if it made the church vomited out in the early Pentecostal age it'll make it vomit out again today it has to be the Shu has to come the tossel can't be the only one the shuck has to come see the carrier now we're living in the last days watch the things that's promised for the hour watch this Moses confirmed no when he got out there some of his own brother turned up against him want to make an organization they said you act like you're the only holy man among us the whole congregation's holy said Kora D let's choose out man to do something Moses he I felt sorry for him he went out and said Lord fell down full the said Lord God said separate yourself from him I had enough of it just opened up the Earth and swallowed them up he noce commission amen God don't deal with organizations he don't deal with groups he deals with individuals that's right always not in groups individuals one person in the last days he said I stand at the door and knock and if any man not any group any man will hear my voice I hear me I'll come into him and St see if any man can hear how can how could this micophone now produce my voice out there unless it was made thus I could scream against that board all my might it wouldn't do nothing amen because this is ordained a made created a microphone and if the word of God is in you from for ordination of God in you my sheep hear my voice they know my hour a stranger they won't follow it's got to be that first all that the father has given me they will come every one of them see now he goes on at the life's end here he only passed notice when he come to the end of the road we're closing now now because it's getting late 25 minutes till 10 notice not at home that's early about 2 3:00 we get say St it's get a little bit late see but now I preach them any night all night long Paul preached this same gospel in his day and a young man fell off of a a wall and killed himself and Paul with that same anointing with that same gospel laid his body up on him he come to life Hallelujah they were interested the church was being farmed something was taking place notice what taking place here Moses when he come down this rich man when he come down a Young Ruler we talked about all religious and belong to church and everything fine educated a fine businessman everything when he come to the end of the road he began to scream there's nowhere to step where is his leadership he had been led by his church was his dead he' been led by the dead world and it wasn't nothing for him to step into but of what the world had prepared for hell but here comes Moses the faithful servant who has steem the reproach of Christ greater Treasures than all the riches of Egypt he come to the end of the road an old man 120 years old walked up on the mountain and you know what a death they before he looked over into the promised land he looked land every side there was his leader The Rock he stepped up on the Rock and the angels of God packed him away into the glor the glory of God into the bosoms of God why 800 years later he was still being led by his leader we find him over on M Transfiguration standing there with Elijah talking to Jesus before he went to the Cross 800 years after death the the one that he esteemed the reproach of his ministry greater treasures and all the popularity of the world and all the money of the world his leader was still leading oh my he was led his leader he led through the death the shadows of death he was led to the Grave hundreds of years later there he stood again because as his youth he had chosen the leadership of the Holy Spirit his name will be great when there is no more Egypt or Treasures when the pyramides are dust and when the Egypt is no more Egypt Moses will be immortal among men because he accepted the leadership ship of Christ instead of going the way his church went there's others that did the same thing look at Enoch he walked with God for 500 years and then he had a testimony that he pleased God God had verified it and said there's no need of you dying just come on up home this afternoon and he went up and Elijah after Bing out bobhair women and everything as he did in his day jezz Bells with a paint on him actually got so full of it and and have done all he could and all that priest making fun of him and everything else he walked down the river one day and just across the river was a horse is hitched to a bush over there a charot of fire and hores a fire he stepped right on and threw his robe off to the next Prophet to follow him and went up into heaven he accepted the leadership of eternal life because it was Christ that was in Elijah oh yes sir what was it Follow Me Now you must choose your leader you've got to choose it friends look at God's looking glass the Bible and see where you're at tonight a little story a little kid one time lived out in the country he never seen a miror he came into the city to see his mother's sister and she had uh had a home oldfashioned homes used to have a Mara on the door I don't know where you remember that or not but this little boy you never seen a Mara so he's playing around the house he looked in the he looked at that little boy and he waved the little boy waved and he pulled his ear and the little boy pulled his ear and on like that he kept walking up close he turned around said Mama that's me that's me what do you look like what are you following what have we done you must choose your leader choose the day you choose life or death your choice will determine your Eternal destination what you choose remember Jesus said follow me and you're invited tonight to do so and to follow him to eternal life you must come on his terms that's right the word not upon the Creed not upon the public opinion not upon what anybody else thinks about it but on what God said about it you say well brother B I know a woman's as good as she can be she does this I know a man that went through this I can't help what they done God's word he said let every man's word be a lie and mine be the truth you've got to come on him his terms come on his conditions the word you cannot come through Creed you cannot come through denomination you cannot mix it like that there's only one thing you can do accept it on his terms that you're willing to die to yourself and all your thoughts and follow him get rid of all the things of the world and follow me I know that's a Stern cut message brother but I didn't come here and choose a a message to the people just to try to make them sing shout holler I've been in Heathen meetings where they've done the same thing I'm interested in your life I'm a servant of God that's got to answer to God someday and the ministry that the Lord has giv me has Vindicated itself thousands of times before you am remember Jesus said follow me follow me get rid of what you've got and follow me that's the only way to have each eternal life that's the only remedy he give this man is the only remedy he give this businessman it's the only remedy he gives anybody his choice he makes his decision it's perfect every time and we must follow him is the only way to have eternal life so the leadership of God is followed the Vindicated word of the hour by the Holy Ghost let us bow our heads statement isn't it let's just take a just a quick moment he said so the leadership of God is individually now each individual is to follow the Vindicated word of the hour by the holy ghost that that it it's it's nice to have Fellowship it's nice to have church church we do everything we can to uh because we're a number of people coming together to have order and to do things decently in order we have uh brothers who donate their lives as deacons to watch out over things that we can keep things operating We Got Musicians who donate their time and and their effort so that we can worship and the ministry preaches and we do all those things but not one of them accounts for anything you've got to know the voice and follow the voice and that and I hope you understood what he's saying he says that's a choice that everybody has to come to and there's a price when you when it comes to make that choice and that's what religion does religion covers up the the choice it's like putting a code on you don't have to make the choice you just put on the same clothing everybody else around you but we we want that eternal life we want to get that goal and and as you notice that he said he said that every time that you make that choice there's a cost and are we willing to pay the price and then he said and the minute you make that choice there's always separation and and I I know it's hard but we all don't have the same life therefore we all don't have the same Choice you've got to follow the word as the word speaks your heart Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so how can you make a choice if you don't listen to the word you don't fellowship with the word you don't get into the word it it it you you've got to come within the range of that voice and make that choice so I just hope it's a blessing to you tonight we we we'll close service now so let's stand together and and and I say you know seek ye first the kingdom of God and all else will be added unto you amen listen to your Shepherd listen for your Shepherd hear ye him and let him come near let us pray this evening before Billy comes lead us in the songs of worship and dismissal our gracious Heavenly Father we heard tonight the last message that he told the church world all the years of his ministry all three polls the breaking of the church ages the revelation of the seals the doctrines and teachings of anointed ones at the end time marriage and divorce so many great things he's finally come to the end of giving his message and he looks out at all the church world and says you got to choose what you're going to [Music] follow are you going to follow what you've seen what you seeing Vindicated are you going to follow the what God saw is placed before you you got to make your choice you got to separate yourself from anything that's contrary to it and settle in on what you're going to feed on and what you're going to believe and what you're going to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit through the Vindicated word of the [Music] hour you can't have two influences in your life you've got to choose an absolute and we're heading [Music] into turbulent times ahead there's a great cloud of Darkness coming over the world [Music] and we've got to stand so CH sure on
