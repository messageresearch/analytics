i've had a wonderful time this weekend god's so good and it's just what's wonderful to see god moving and uh you know we know from the bible and from the message it's only going to get better i was uh

and we had a star that came in our day but he wasn't the only star you know we lift up people because they're good at sports or because they can pretend in front of a camera or something like that but you know what god has some real celebrities you know but we don't take our fame on ourself we we give our glory to god but it's okay for us to glorify god in one another it's okay for us to do that you know and uh god's just so good uh you know we we we we can only use human language to try our best you know to worship him but i think just like when we pray you know how the spirit says that that the the bible says that the spirit makes intercession for us you know with the interceding force with things that can't be uttered i believe he does that to us when we try to praise him too you know but i wanted to sing something and just a little a song of appreciation in english and in spanish it's called uh um you know padressa [Music] a [Music] it is [Music] is [Music] heavenly father we

front who was laying there on a cot he told him to get up and receive your healing in the name of jesus christ right when he said that i stood up out of my chair and i said satan in the name of jesus christ i command you to get out of my home to leave me to leave my wife you're no longer welcome here in the name of jesus christ and about that time my phone buzzed but i'm in church so i ain't gonna pick it up you know what i mean i might be streaming but i'm still in church and uh so it went on went on and um buzzed again i just left it alone and then brother billy came up and he was closing out

[Music] hello [Music] yourself [Music] god be the glory bless your saints i'm my son i would always do that uh i think it was tuesday i came back from work uh and then um before david talked about the teams for this meeting and my wife also came back from the clinic and said oh they were talking about the tragedy that happened you know in houston and they were just talking and so in my mind i told my wife i was like huh well i see that uh and i was imagining myself being there but i couldn't see how i could be there and so i told my wife you know when they talked about it you know everybody had their opinion about it and i told my wife i said wow look at the war the world we're living in is crazy and the only thing i could just think of was oh my goodness oh lord i'm just waiting for you we're just waiting for you because i can't find myself i can't see myself there for any reason and so i told my wife i said you know what about horse what are we doing to get ready because we know the day of our own redemption droidner and so that's the thing i was thinking and then um you know i i was telling her as well i said while you know the world is crazy you and i can both agree on that um in egypt you know that that was crazy as well but there was goshen there was peace and you know the people that probably you know left goshen to go to egypt for walk every day and then come back to goshen why goshen was all chaos while egypt was chaos goshen was at peace and so i thought about that song i said oh the day of our redemption and then so my son is two i'm going to the two i think they tied together and then my other song is i'm bound for the promised land so when i know okay my dear of redemption enjoy it now what am i doing because i want to be ready and then i know that i'm

you stepped into my you took me by the hand you marched me out in freedom into the promised land [Music] [Applause] i've got a david close this up uh i don't know what to say where have all you been hiding amen i think the the lord went into our egypt hasn't he amen amen he's how many feel he's bringing you somewhere amen do you feel you've come up higher this week amen a great desire to serve him you know i i just thought in my heart i thought oh god i could have served you so much better you know and i i can't do nothing about yesterday but i can do something about now and i i just want to live a better now hey man i i've just uh you know i'm so humbled i just can't express to you how humbled i am to see i don't know one of the gifts that are coming and you know i've i've listened to brother jeff for hours and hours and hours on end and i never knew he had a voice that good so i'm telling you don't ever think you've got it figured out i've been pastoring sister jeannie for over 30 years and i never heard her sing a special so the days of miracles have not [Applause] are still uh but i think what moves me the most and this weekend was the spirit of unity that i felt and you know i felt as brother tom ministered and brother burly i felt that i was a part of a bigger picture than just here this is my part to play but i i really feel that god is gathering that bride to bed together you know we're promised a time of uniting were promised an invisible union and it's marvelous when you sense that that head is coming down and that capstone is uniting and and uh you know i mean uh you know just and it's not always the great big adults i mean a lamborghini had me dancing in my seat back there you know what i mean so uh i i mean when you can start to see the spirit of god move in our our children and and and you know that's if the lord tarries that's the generation i i i'm not worried if the lord takes me you know what i mean because this this word is going to go on and on and on and you know i thought about it many times uh as you know i i came into the message early 70s and and it's it's been a long time and you would think well you know you know brother branham would become history and the message will be passed and then i just got realizing it's it it's so him you know what i mean that we are breaking into eternity you know what i mean the thoughts of god the very thing that god had in mind is actually materializing you know and in the message he said in sirs we would see jesus he said he said it's all because god is becoming tangible and uh you know i'm so thrilled about that you know that that how we support one another and love one another and i thought i don't know how many different languages we sang in uh tonight you know what i mean but he understood every one of them amen and i felt the spirit of god in every one of them and i i think that's a beautiful thing because the lord said they will know that you are my disciples by your love one for another he never said by your doctrine never said by your teaching never said by anything but he said by your love one for another and that's where the victories won is one in love divine and in the word to the church he said you know just remember the enemy will try to break you up he said but you pull your belts tighter you put your arms around one another and you pray for one another and you remember everybody is in this together and you can't make it without one another so it's a beautiful body it's a beautiful time and and i'm so grateful i just can't express my appreciation for the ministry my friend brother tom and the gospel he preached i really feel that we've been empowered this week and that we can take the courage i i believe that we've got to have courage and that we can stand on what we believe and god will stand with us we can testify to what's in our hearts and god will vindicate it we're not in this alone amen he's here with us and the spirit's with us and the spirit will move so we can leave those things which are behind and press for a higher calling so i just if i could just make each one of you feel as important as you are to him you say how important are you to him he left the glory and came down amen and when he was hanging there on the cross as the song says you were on his mind my name was on his lips amen and that's him and i i just can't say enough about him and and where he found me and where he brought me from and and i'm glad i'm not alone i want you all to know that i'm glad i'm not alone i'm on a journey and and i know we have a great hearts desire to have a facility that that accommodates our needs and i believe that's just right around the corner but i feel more satisfied now that the spirit that's moving amongst us that we're ready to inhabit the tabernacle with the right attitude the right spirit the right goals the right faith and the right belief to make it worthwhile and so that that thrills me you know i just have to ask for your prayers and and your kindness and your mercy towards me as we you know we seek the lord for the gospel to bring i don't have another gospel than that which has been brought to us amen and i just trust that we can continue to go into the storehouse and bring out the things that are there that our messenger has for us amen does anybody know it all yet because i would certainly want to offer it to you but i think he can certainly still feed us amen so i i know we're growing and you know i i i always listen to that message perfect strength and perfect weakness and it doesn't give me much of a way out you know i mean i i i've got what is it called add you know and you've probably experienced that with me i'll be talking to you and right in the middle of a conversation walk off you know but my mind and all of a sudden i'm gone i have facial recognition disorder and that's not good because i can't remember a face and so if two people look the same i can't tell them apart and then that creates a complex and i get a shame because i don't know which name to call them and you know so i got a lot of reasons and excuses not to be here and i don't know how i ever got here and then the prophet says you can't use your excuses so then i think well maybe i can go over to some of my abilities you know i i can be pretty persuasive so i just and and and then i can't use that either but there is one thing i can use and that's the vindicated word of god and that's what we all want anyway isn't it so we're a body we're a very unique body we're made out of i think over 13 or 14 different african countries uh different countries from central america philippines for all over the place but there's one thing that's brought us together and that's the holy spirit and and let's just let nothing come in between so as for our song the thing i'd like to sing that blessed be the tie that binds and let's just stand together and [Music] we're going to say a prayer and just in your heart just pray for everybody around you and in your heart say in your heart if i could say this father i'm a part of this body and this body is a part of me you place me here with this group of people and i'm going to serve this group of people with all my heart and if you call me from this place to serve you somewhere else i'll never forget them i'll take them with me in the depth of my soul and i thank you father for the love that you've placed on my heart lord i ask you to bless this people tonight give them the desire of their heart father with their struggles that they face because the flesh wars against the spirit the doubts that arise because the enemy is the accuser of the brethren all the battles that they have may they know that there's one that [Music] never leaves them or never forsakes them and will take them all the way through may they leave this place closer to you lord jesus feeling your love purposed and dedicated to your cause we ask it lord jesus because you're so gracious and so wonderful and so personal amen will you sing it with me bless [Music] that binds [Music] [Music] is [Music] me [Music] one we share our [Music] oh [Applause] tell me god bless you tonight you're dismissed go in peace the [Music] you
