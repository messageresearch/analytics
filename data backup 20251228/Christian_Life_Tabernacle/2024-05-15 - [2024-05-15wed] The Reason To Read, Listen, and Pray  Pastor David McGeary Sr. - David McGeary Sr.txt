loving kindness oh and it's filling my heart as I sing how great are you Lord oh [Music] [Music] the room grew still as she made her way to Jesus she stumbled through the tears that made her blind she felt such pain some spoke in Anger her folks whisper there's no place here for her kind still on she came through the shame that flushed her face until at last she knelt before his feet and though she spoke no words everything she said was her as she poured her love forth the master from her box of alabas so I've come to pour my praise on him from Mary's Alabaster Box so don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and dry them with my hair cuz you were there the night he found me you did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his ling arms around me and you don't know the ca of the oil in my Alabaster Rock I can't forget the way life used to be cuz I was a prisoner to the sin that had me found I spent my days pouring my life without measure into a little treasure box I thought I had found until the day when Jesus came to me and healed my soul with the wonders of his touch so now I'm giving back to him all the praise he's worthy of I've been forgiven and that's why I love him so much and I've come to pour my praise on him my from Mary alab Bo so don't be angry if I wash his feet with my tears and dry them with my hair cuz you w there the night he found me you did not feel what I felt when he wrapped his loving arms around me and you don't know the cost of the oil you don't know the cost of the oil you don't know the cost of the oil in my I am the [Music] P amen wonderful man let's all stand at this time let's sing that song we sang the other day you can't cross the Rood line as we invite our pastor at this time amen amen man let's start with the course maybe that's easy oh I just got to tell you Satan you can't cross the bloodline CU I'm covered by his blood oh and you may save and you may find you're going to lose this battle tonight we remember you came just sing it one more time oh and I just got to tell you Satan you can't cross the bloodline cuz I'm covered by his blood oh and you may stand and you may fight you're going to lose this battle tonight oh remember you can't sing that first ver oh even though my spirit L and it seems I can hardly go but still I see victory oh many times I'm walking by faith I can see what lies before me still I see Victory oh and I just got to tell you Satan [Music] amen amen Satan is one Underdog I don't root for you know I've got Underdog syndrome that means even if my favorite team's playing I all of a sudden start feeling sorry for the underdog you know but now I found an underdog I don't root for he's the biggest Underdog of them all he's a loser he's already lost he's got nothing to bring to the table in fact he has a title the father of lies and there's no truth in him that's quite a testimony he's got right so why would we even listen to him right I remember one time I prayed for somebody and they came up to me and says Satan keeps telling me I ain't going to make it I thought really that tells me one thing you're already there cuz he's a liar right amen I like that song let's turn in our Bibles tonight I won't keep you long tonight uh uh as you're turning I'll let you know my my mom is uh well I guess the only way to say it is is that we know she's got a lot of ears and and she've just kind of started uh her decline if I could say it that way she's not sick she's just got 100 and a couple years uh that she's lived and her body isn't um going like it used to she did very good for a lot of years she's still sharp of course she doesn't have the energy and she doesn't have the appetite she had so uh we know that we're facing our our last time uh with her um it could be days it could be weeks could be months but it's not going to be very long so I certainly ask for your prayers and your understanding because I'm going to try to be out there as much as I can and and I know we have such capable ministry here that um uh it allows me to uh maybe be gone just a little bit so anyway uh just keep us in prayer it's kind of an emotional strain you know being there and and everything and very very tiring so um I am a little weary but I just have a little thought I I had something on my heart I wanted to preach and then I visited with Matthew and Matthew kind of gave me some words and thoughts so I've provided for him for lots of years so I stole this thought from Matthew so that's what ministers do right is we steal each other's sermons that's what they do prophet of God said many a time he'd listen to a sermon and he'd get a strike of inspiration from it so this is just a simple thought tonight something that uh I I want to sew in your hearts so um it would be like a tool you could use and uh if I um I had a sermon title uh maybe I could call it the reason to read listen and pray the reason to read listen and pray and I hope that I can just give you a little uh thought to do it so if you have your Bibles let's turn to a very familiar scripture um and uh it's found in Malachi uh 4 and we'd like to read it and then we'd like to read a scripture in uh St John um um 39 and just read a few scriptures there so I'm sure you already know this scripture by heart you probably didn't have to turn there um but um we like reading that out of the pages it said remember ye the law of Moses my servant which I commanded un unto him in harb for all Israel with the statutes and judgments said behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse and U now I'd like to just point one little thing that he shall he shall okay he's the one okay we to hold that thought and then over here in St John the uh fifth chapter and the 39th verse it says um he says search the scriptures so what's he telling them to do search the scriptures for in them ye think ye have eternal life and they are they which testify of me and ye will not come to me that you might have life I receive not honor from men but I know ye that ye have not the love of God in you I am come in my father's name and you receive me not if another shall come in his own name him ye shall receive how can you believe which receiveth honor one of another and seek not the honor that Cometh From God God only amen Heavenly Father we ask you to bless the scriptures in jesus' name we pray amen you may be seated I'd also like to read a little uh statement tonight I'd like to uh greet all our visitors that are here and tonight Lord be with you and our brother from South Africa you you're hiding there somewhere all right good to have you we have you on the schedule so uh I'm giving you notice and you can ask all the ministers in the church I never give anybody notice I read a scripture that said be instant in season and out of season and I just thought I might as well apply that to everybody so uh I always tell the guys if you ever come over to hang out just remember there's one thing I do is work so always be ready to work right so we we like it this is a statement that um I I looked at in a little different light than I've looked at it before and um I I I trust it's a blessing um if I I just want to give you something tonight that you could uh maybe remember a little motivating or a tool to work with and remember Jesus says this in perfect faith and it says he said now he's talking about the story is about you know that there was a uh a a person that uh that had a uh an Affliction and the disciples couldn't move it and U and so uh Jesus uh kind of uh he did scold him I don't think that's what wasn't a rebuke but I think he was really pointing out something to them he said oh ye of little faith oh ye of little faith so I think he was trying to say something to them like you're lacking something okay and um uh so but then our prophet in explaining that goes on to take it in maybe a little different Viewpoint than we would um uh think and I and I want to look at in a little different Viewpoint um that he says he says now he says now remember they had the word so Jesus told them right go out uh uh L your hands on the sick cast out Devils if someone doesn't receive you shake the uh the you know dust off your feet and uh and they were rejoicing uh because the of the Miracles that they saw like uh he said I saw Satan falling you know like a star falling from heaven and and he makes a remarkable statement he says don't rejoice in all the work you done but rather Rejoice because your name was written in heaven so uh there was something that existed that they didn't know and I think the reason that he sent them out was for the purpose that they might come to the understanding that their names was written in heaven that there was something that was greater than uh uh The Works that they saw okay so it was already there wasn't it so it was already written in heaven their names were okay so in my little thought if you'll just take these little pieces and help me put them together he says now remember they had the word and the Word was flesh then and the word told them I give you power amen I give you power and they had the power so they they had the power was given to them they had the power is that right but they didn't have faith to operate the word that was in them and and then we go on uh he says see what I mean but Jesus had it he was the word and he had faith that what he said would happen he said oh bring him here how long will I suffer you and uh we could go on reading but I I I want to uh have a a little thought uh uh uh here and and I've already given um Matthew all the credit he's going to get so uh we're just going to go on because it's all in the word of God right and really none of us ever uh created the word of God a lot of people try to invent the word of God but the word of God is not made to be invented it it it's not made to be created but it's made to be discovered okay so the the faith they had the power but they hadn't discovered the faith to use the power and and so uh the the word discovered uh and I'm I'm going to try to do something I've always tried to do is preach a 25 20 to 25 minute sermon because brother Ram said they were the best and I've never preached the best sermon you know what I mean I had a good friend of mine tell me one time after I preached he say you're never going to preach any better than that and I thought should I continue on you know and then you sometimes you preach for years and somebody'll come up that's the best I ever heard you preach and then you think well man how how lousy were my other sermons you know so uh but we don't measure uh the how it's delivered we go by one thing in anyway is we live by truth so it's not how it's said it's what is said and and we want something that that said that strengthens us and fortifies US gives us some insight um it it doesn't have to be a a great thing uh sometimes the smallest tool does the the biggest job and he said like a watch he said you know it's the smallest little spring that causes is the thing to work so you wouldn't have the big picture without the little teeny uh Springs and little uh things that go together to make it work so we just want to give you one so uh I I was talking about these guys as he talks about these disciples they had the power so it was not something that they didn't have but it it existed but so uh you when you discover something you you you're not finding something that doesn't exist you understand it's already there it already exists and so I think what Jesus was really wanting them to discover was their election and that their name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life that was really what he was after because if we would go on to read further he talks about he says to him he says now Jesus believed who he was he believed who God said he was he had faith in what he knew he had faith in his position that's because he discovered it and other words he found it right okay and and when you discover something something is you come across it uh maybe accidentally or when you're searching for something or you're looking for something you come across something and we call that Discovery oh I discovered this I didn't know it was there I didn't know it existed I I I didn't I didn't know I had that in my possession it I I I totally didn't realize it until I discovered it you you know what I mean it's like America they did they didn't know it was out there they just thought it was blue uh water out there some people thought you'd fall off the end of the Earth so someone uh decided the way they saw the sun and everything and the sunet and the sunrise they knew that it had to be going somewhere and so it it put a curiosity in them and they begin to search so they begin to go out out and they began to go and they went so far and they hadn't fallen off and so they kept going and lo and behold they discovered America now they didn't invent America America was always there okay so it existed and but they came across it they they they found it they discovered it and all of a sudden they they they they saw and they found out there was people living there you know how how that's kind of like a church when they find out there's other people saved you know there's other people that got the Holy Ghost you know uh you know uh you mean we're not the only ones you know uh you call that living in your own world your own existence you know but sometimes if you go outside your world you discover that there's other things there's other understandings there's other things to know that it isn't just the way that you think it is and and and you you you you ran across it in your search so they discovered America and so they didn't find something new they found something that all uh already existed and and so there's uh there there's something uh there's something there and so these disciples they had the word they had the power they've seen it but when they ran across something they they didn't know how to handle it they didn't have the faith or the Revelation or they hadn't yet discovered what that they possessed cuz they had the power okay but they didn't have they hadn't discovered the faith yet the faith existed that's right right but they hadn't discovered the faith that was going to make that power work yes sir so the Lord's telling them the faith that's going to make your power work is if you could ever discover the fact that your name's written on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world then then you would come to the realization that uh that you were made for this position and I I like what brother Billy said Sunday when he was talking about something has to have a connectivity you know it's got to be able to connect and and some people can't connect with something because there's nothing in them to connect with but how would you like to uh realize that you you're not connecting with something but you have what's in you to connect with it but you haven't discovered it yet and and uh and so uh and that's why my my thought is that you you need something that will cause you to discover that that now Jesus did that by giving them power and having them use that power and hop that they would discover oh this was part of my inheritance this is part of my positioning that they would come to the Revelation Jesus was trying to do something to get them to discover that there was something in them that exists now when you go back to Malachi 4:5 we we find the same uh positioning and we could we went we could go back to proving his word and we remember that God planted a seed there right so there's something there it exists the seed of Faith the seed that was going to receive uh Revelation was already there so if I could say this the the faith was given but the believer and the person had to discover that that Faith was in them the prophet of God talks about you'd go from this place to that place and then you would stumble in and you would find the Salvation you you stumbled into it in other words you discovered it it was there all the time you you know we know that uh pigs don't become lambs and Lambs don't become pigs but what happens a lamb can be in a pig pan until he discovers that he's not a pig wouldn't it be great if we could discover that we don't have to live yes sir we we live and do things many times because we we we don't know anything else because we haven't discovered that something else exists or that God has something else for us so we continue on as we are and and we continue on with what they got but what what we need is we need uh a a discovery we need to come across something that exists so we know that that there was a faith that was planted for our day and our time and a people that was planted how many believe that that God put you here he he he predestinated you to be here he fixed you up with the wife you've got he gave you the children you have that everything was pre-planned by God back to your great great grandfather everything came down but but you didn't know that but what God wants you to come to is the discovery of that you know and and I I'm not using the word revelation for these things because I I want you to understand Discovery has something to do with a search that's right okay so yeah you know or or in your journey you come across something you discover it it it's not like we just sit back and and and God just drops Revelation in on us D ding you know the light comes back that's not what we do we we take life's journey we go down the road of life and we're knocking our heads against this and we're fighting against that and and and we're just so frustrated and all that and then lo and behold we discover something Have you ever discovered a $5 bill in your purse or your wallet or your pocket ET I I do it all the time I'll find a suit out and I'll get my suit on I'll reach in the pocket oh $20 you know what I mean I I just I said well praise the Lord lesie doesn't search my pockets before she hangs up my suit you know I discovered it no it was there it was there all the time like the song he was there all the time right well we didn't necessarily find him right he found us but what he did is he led us to discover him because the footsteps of the righteous are led by the Lord and so that's what Malachi for is the seed is there he planted it proving his word he told us that he takes the seed right and he predestines it to be there so it's laying there but it's not discovered you didn't discover that see I I I went through all kinds of terrible life before I came across the knowledge and the understanding that there was something in there that God put there so I was led to the discovery and so that's what Malachi 4 does right he he says he shall restore the faith of the children back to their fathers so there there had to be something that led you to the Discovery do you understand that and so I have a relative that's uh sick and and uh she and and she has Faith you know what I mean but uh but I she's lacking the tool you understand to discover the faith and the healing that's in her okay and and so I in my heart I thought oh if I could just get her to listen to the voice of Malachi 45 and and and I believe that that voice was given sir as the means of Discovery you understand it it's the it's the the the that will open up to her it's that's what his purpose was was to restore the faith the faith is there but she needs something that would cause her to discover that Faith so it's like Jesus talked about men going on honor another man's honor I couldn't say well you've got faith God's okay but you need something greater than the faith and belief of man that's right you need something that connects you with something that's inside of you you need something to that allows you to discover the faith that's in you Jesus did that he sat down with those Elders he sat down with the scriptures he heard the story and he discovered who he was he discovered it he ran across it he found it that's right it was through Discovery it was discovered and that's what that's what Jesus said he said you search the scriptures CU in you you think you have eternal life but they are which testifying of me so they were reading the scriptures and they never discovered him in the scriptures was he there he was there all the time every prophecy every example every scripture was right there all the time right but he never they never discovered it because they rejected the word that would have opened their eyes and giving them Isa to discover it what do he do he gives you isab that you might what see can I insert a word there he gives you isab that you might Discover right you might come across and see it and see it and then know oh I've got this that's why I said I the reason that we listen yes sir the reason that that we pray and the reason that we read is that we might discover we might find something we're not just reading to fulfill a check on the box I've read the Bible for years and things pop up to me I'm still discovering things in the word of God now am I making them up I hope not am I inventing them they've been there all the time yes sir but I didn't Discover it now if I would never read it I would never Discover it even the kingdom of God is like a man that finds a treasure what does he do he discovers a treasure he discovered it wow there's a treasure here now he's willing to pay the price to apprehend the benefits of what he discovered and a lot of Believers Never grab a hold of the benefits of what they discovered the pearl of great price the treasure in the field but a lot of people go over things they miss things because they're not searching the scriptures Jesus said you search the scriptures but you search them for the wrong reason because you think that your eternal life is in your knowledge but he said they are which testifying of me now they would approached the scriptures correctly they would have known that he was the Messiah how many know is that sure it was there to be discovered now I want you to look at your position there's things there that are given to you to discover but if you're not looking for them you're not searching for them you're not asking for them you're not knocking on you won't discover so God sent a messenger to lead you to Discovery he sent the scriptures for you to read to lead you to Discovery prayer leads you to Discovery because it put you in a position to listen yes to discover now can you imagine if if we think we've got it and there's no more Discovery in our life there's no more there's no more uh Treasures in the field no more pearls a great price that's too many people's attitude with the message they think they know it they think they've got it they think it's you know it's there and let me I'll just say it like this until you can walk on water and raise the dead there's something to discover uh by no means I hope I didn't mean that in Sac religious you know what I mean but here it is the perfect love that as he is so are we in this world so when we can understand that the reason we're reading is for Discovery the reason that we're listening is for Discovery the reason that we're praying is for Discovery it's not a religious ceremony it's not to feel good it's to find something to discover something can you imagine if your life could change to a life of Discovery I had a friend that told me the story he was a Dairy Farmer in Pennsylvania when he took a fella to a a dairy farm and the guy saw them milking cows and you know what he said oh that's where milk comes from the guy looked at me says well where did you think milk come from he said the grocery store no I'm telling you you don't want to be trapped in your own mind and your own spiritual level and be stuck being spiritually ignorant but you want to realize wait a minute there's a world of Discovery for me in the scriptures if I search the scriptures they are which testify of him I can discover more about him things for me to discover you can discover what Real Love Is you can discover what real attraction is you can discover what real wealth is you can discover the in the scriptures the things for a successful business it's all there it's all there to be discovered so that's what I I want to I'm in to close it's a miracle because I I I want to really go but I want to tell story and so that's why we want to read so don't read to read read to discover Lord give me isav that I might see Lord give me white rainment that I can dress better L Lord give me a gold how many would like to discover gold all I hear everywhere advertisement for gold gold gold well we've had an advertisement for gold since the a of patness buy of me gold right buy gold you want to discover gold it's in the word it's in prayer you got to discover it though you've got to be on a trip journey of Discovery so that's my little thought tonight I want you to understand I I want us to become explorers discoverers Searchers of the scriptures finding the The Riches of God the riches of his knowledge may you increase in knowledge may you increase in spirit may may you increase in in in the wealth of the G uh gifts and and the character of Christ discover and there's got to be some tool you understand that leads you to the Discovery yes if not you would walk right over the top of something how would you like to be out in the field and you picked up a great big rock yeah kind of a funny looking rock kind of clear I know kind of looks like I don't know quartz crystal or whatever and you just threw it down and then you were some place and you started reading a book and you found out what you just threw down was a diamond something had to let you know that wasn't just a rock yes sir and that's why God had to send somebody to let you know you're not just a church member yes you're a child of God he had to give you sermons that would lead you to a discovery not knowledge a discovery of something that exists in you right he looked at me and says I can you I know you guys you don't even have the love of God how would you like to discover yes that the love of God is in you when you discover something it puts an end to the question wonderful this whole journey in this message is based on Discovery I I think we we we we got uh took revelation and turned it into an accumulation of knowledge it's not this is an accumulation of Discovery yes sir I'm going to discover who I am I'm going to discover what I got I'm going to discover what I made of I'm going to discover the power that God gave me I'm going to discover the position that God given me and I'm not the guy that does it amen there's not one of us in here that does it it was given to Malachi 45 to do it he's the one that straightens out the world he's the one that straightens out countries he's the one that straightens out the gospel he don't need us that's right he's trying to lead us to Discovery and we're trying to lead other people to discovery of what we don't even know alls you can discover from me is what I know and that's means to sit back and go oh that's all he knows the brothers that do electrical work with me they call me old school cuz I only know old stuff and they got all kinds of new gadgets I said that's a cheap way of doing stuff you know no electrician just sticks wires in a little yellow thing you got to twist those babies you know what I mean and put your wiring on there till your hands are sore no they've discovered easier ways to doing things and the spirit moves on so could you imagine me going someplace and I'm going to give them all that I know to how far that I am you know how long it it's going to take till they know you're an ignoramus not long how many wants me to program your computer nobody why cuz you think I haven't discovered I don't even I they had to teach me how to turn mine on I couldn't even discover the button I had to have somebody help me discover the button right so you understand that's what the message is it's the key to our Discovery amen it's the key to discovering really what's in the Scriptures it it's it's it's it's not only Revelation the way we think it of but it's the whole discovery of what God's got for us for this age let's be explorers I like to close with the story Matthew shared the story with me I just really fit with what exactly was in my heart there was a man here recently and he was at home and so I I want you to understand it takes something to cause Discovery you're led into Discovery now I want you to picture this fellow he's broke he just lost his leg he's never had nothing and he's in great wonderment of what his life holds and how long he can hang on to what little bit he has very tough place to be and so he's sitting on on his couch and him and his wife turn on their television and they start watching the Antique Road Show and they sitting there on their couch and they're watching the Antique Road Show and this guy comes in with a blanket and they pull the blanket up and the guy looks at the blanket you know the antique shows they bring items to appraisers so the guy looks at the blanket and he says wow he said this is a great blanket he says this blanket could be worth $10,000 possibly maybe as high as 50 and the guy's looking at the blanket and all of a sudden it Dawns on them that look looks exactly like the blanket that's on the back of his couch so him and his wife jump up and they pull up the blanket and they're holding it up to the TV and they say wow this blanket looks just like that blanket see he was led to discovery of something that he always had but he needed a tool so now he's got this blanket so it brings it down to an appraiser and the guy says yeah he says that looks real let me send it off for some testing he says man this blanket might be worth 50 Grand look I says 50 Grand wow I got nothing and somebody will give me 50 grand for this blanket so
