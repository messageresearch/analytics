healing is in your wings lord god those who are afflicted this morning have only to reach out and to touch the hymn of your garment lord god we believe by faith that we are in an appointed place lord god your prepared place of worship lord god even now lord god touch the man of god and use him in a mighty way that we might be fed our souls are thirsty for us in jesus name we pray amen amen amen god bless you we're gonna invite brother mike to come with their songwriting this morning amen good morning i'm going to be reading in psalm 15 this morning and i was just looking at that yesterday you know the verse the scripture begins lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy hill you know i was thinking about that as i was reading it you know a tabernacle is a place of worship you know we tend to think i think of a tabernacle as a building or as a um as a physical space where people come together and hold worship services but that's not what david was looking for that's really not what god's looking for but it's usually what men will settle for you know and as long as we've got us a building you know meeting faithfully in that building and holding worship services whenever we can we're satisfying the vision you know if we're not careful we can also begin to measure our own spirituality or that of someone else's by attendance to worship services you know meeting in worship to hear the word of the lord and to strengthen one another that's just our good and faithful service but if we're not careful we can make it a tradition a religion a ceremony you know really like anyone else as long as attendance to mass is satisfactory we're good right but when david speaks of a tabernacle a place of worship he speaks of it as being a place where someone dwells lives abides not just three visits a week right you know psalm 27 verse 4 is a familiar scripture to us it says one thing have i desired of the lord that will i seek after that i may dwell in the house of the lord all the days of my life not in the future not in heaven but all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the lord and to inquire in his temple for in the time of trouble how many could say we live in a troubled time he shall hide me in his pavilion in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me so the tabernacle is a secret place it's not a building with a sign on a four-lane road it's a place where god hides his people it's not a place you drive to it's a hidden place where if you dwell there you can find safety and stability in a troubled time you know we're all familiar with the story of jesus and the woman at the well in john 4. you know you know the story it's a woman who's living a hopeless life until jesus comes by her way i must needs go through samaria there's someone i have to meet you know and as he and the woman begin to talk you know she begins to realize that there's something different about this one she begins to recognize this is a time where maybe she can get some of her questions answered you know it's interesting that one of the questions that this sinful woman asks is something none of the other religious worshipers in her day asked she asked what's the right way to worship you can read that in john 4 20. she says our fathers worshipped in this mountain and ye jews say that a jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship everybody pointing to their building their place their surface their way of worship as being his tabernacle but notice how he responds in verse 21 jesus saith unto her woman believe me the hour is coming when ye shall neither in this mountain nor yet at jerusalem worship the father if go on to verse 23 it says but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth not in a building not in a worship service not at a specific time of day or day of week for the father seek us such to worship him so who are these people these true worshipers how does someone get to this tabernacle psalm 15 1 lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy hill he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness speaketh the truth in his heart not just in his lips and the whole rest of psalm 15 as we read that right now describes who is abiding in this tabernacle you know what's interesting is there's no mention about their ability to speak about spiritual things or what they believe or their attendance to worship services or their observance of religious obligations or traditions all of those things can be produced in the flesh none of the things which men do mean anything if it does not produce what psalm 15 is talking about this is a description of someone who's walking in the sikh is there a dwelling in the secret place of worship a life abiding every day constantly in his tabernacle micah 6 7 it was a scripture that kind of came to my mind this weekend it says this will the lord be pleased with thousands of rams or with ten thousands of rivers of oil that's a lot of worship services shall i give my firstborn for my transgression the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul that's some pretty sincere religion there he hath showed thee oh man what is good and what doth the lord require of thee but to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy god dwelling in the tabernacle so as we read psalm 15 this morning and david asked the question who shall abide in thy tabernacle remember god hasn't called a people to go to church he's called a people to be a church and those are entirely different things so let's read that together psalm 15 chapter 1 or verse 1 lord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy hill he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbor nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor in whose eyes a vile person is contempt but he honoreth them that fear the lord he that sweareth to his own heart and changeth not he that putteth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward against the innocent he that doeth these things shall never be moved and then god bless you have your seats let's sing this on i'm i'm looking for a city the one that made my hands amen i'm looking for a city i'm looking over jordan i see the promised land [Music] my [Music] [Music] from the mountains [Music] is [Music] he's left me he made me [Applause] i got the revelations is [Music] [Music] he's letting i placed it in my

the overflow room amen uh it's also sister hope's birthday today so we want to wish her happy birthday amen brother david kabaya just would want to thank god for his protection and thankful for the church for the prayers that that we were praying for him amen but those that the brothers that are ready to take the offering they could come at this time i should bow our heads as we just pray lord jesus lord we just approach your throne this morning lord knowing that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord and you change not so lord here we are lord just your bride just gathered

is [Music] it's [Music] god bless you church today uh my my voice is going to be very cracky so i don't think i'll get the tune but i think uh i was cut by uh the meaning of the song uh it says that mighty uh almighty fortress is our god um and the reason why i was you know i was thinking about that was uh you know but abram said uh the mind is the greatest battle ever fought you know in your mind so you keep struggling you know back and forth and i haven't seen some traumatic experience um you know sometimes i wake up and um it's just gonna it's so weird because it's like oh today's gonna be the last day it was like where's that thought coming from um you know maybe just having some flashbacks and then um you know uh i have to go back and before i knew it you know i'll start hearing that voice telling me well i've saved you from this this this and that and that don't you know how powerful i am that i can do anything um in fact i was that telling myself about friends i can remember friends who tell me so how did you do it did you have some diabolic power or something i was like i i don't know but but i know of someone who was able to help me out and and so i would confess who god is to them and uh so this song came to my mind and my dad used to sing this song with his very deep voice i don't think i have that but i'll try almighty fortress he's a god abu work never failing i'll help her he meets the floor of mortar eels prevailing for still i hation for the seek to walk as wool is craft power great and harmed with cool elite on earth he's not he's [Music] indeed we now strand confide our striving would be losing we're not the right man on our side the man of god's own choosing don't ask who that may be christ jesus he'd easy lord sober jesus name from age to age the same and he must win the battle and though this world with devils field should try thing to undo us we will not fear for god at will it's true to triumph too the prince of darkness green will tremble not for him is rage we can endure for louise do me sure one little word shall failing that word above or earthly pause no thanks to them i by death the spirit and the gift of us to emo with us [Music] there's more to life also the body they may kill god's truth abideth still his kingdom is forever amen amen i had this song on my heart this morning so we're gonna see if we can

[Music] is [Music] amen father we have approached your throne this morning singing of how great that you are father knowing that not only do you know what we have need of but you have the power to provide as the father of our faith [Music] spoke these great words that he knew that you were able to perform that which you promised we all have needs father in our life seeking your will and we ask this morning that you stir our heart sin ever so united closer with your word and the understanding of what is transpiring in the hour that we are living father the words that were spoken by a prophetic messenger your servant william mary and branham father that you brought into this world to bring a message to a church to an elected lady and now that word that was spoken is manifesting in flesh father and it's coming to a maturity [Music] and father we're here this morning to [Music] listen and to study and to show ourselves proof father that that manifestation may be alive in each one of us we ask you to help us this morning our children are starting back to school we have jobs to go to things that we have to accomplish to live but lord we know that a new life awaits us and lord we'll tarry and look up until that day arrives we ask these things this morning in jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen god bless you this morning if you have your bibles and will turn with me over to the first corinthians and in the 15th chapter of first corinthians i i guess probably most everybody knows by now that wednesday i got involved in an accident and i hate to say it but it was my fault and but you know god brings all things well you know both airbags went off and i got hit pretty hard or kind of a combination of me hitting and him hitting but he had a bigger vehicle then i he had a semi and i had a pickup truck and the semi truck won but uh i i kind of i knew i knew i had a concussion but what i didn't know is sometimes it takes two or three days for the symptoms to show up so the symptoms started showing up yesterday afternoon so i think i might be able to hold it together a little bit this morning but so i said well what do you do for a concussion and the first thing they said you do is you don't socialize and i thought well that ain't gonna work and uh and then so and then you know bright lights uh bother you and uh it's not like we don't have any light here so all these things but and then your cognitive abilities you know to recall and to put sentences together gets a little bit impaired so if i have a few little stumblings this morning aren't you glad we have a solid message that we can listen to that can fetus and take through so i want you to know it's the concussion it's not age that's my story and i'm sticking with it so let us read i i'm telling you these little scriptures here in corinthians i've read them all my life but i've never understood them like i've understood them since i've been listening to this message is the rising of the sun and uh this message has really stirred me and examined me and it's it's still working but let us read and we'll read from the 51st verse through the 54th verse it says behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment sorry let some of you find it first corinthians the 15th chapter again the 51st verse behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trump shall sound and the dead shall be risen incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality for when this corruptable shall have put on in corruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in victory heavenly father bless your word amen god bless you may be seated as we know that we've been studying this great sermon the rising of the sun he's been explaining to us how that death is swallowed up in victory how that it's been swallowed up in the victory and the victory that was won and is being won right now as he's been separating us and calling us out of this world and so it's a a marvelous thing to think that you're in something that is corruptable and you know uh we talk a lot about corruption nowadays because the political world is corrupt uh it appears to me that science is corrupt you say well how is science corrupt well they think that they're developing something to fix something and yet they're causing another uh side effect if i could uh say it that way and so something that is corruptable means if if you're corruptable uh you might be honest but if you have a nature that can be corrupted something come it can can't come in and uh bribe you or or lead you astray or uh cause you to do things that you wouldn't normally do so that that's a nature that's corruptable and so we just aren't looking at it as uh uh the corruption of the flesh as when it goes into the grave you understand a lot of times when we talk about corruptable that's the way that we look at it we look at it that it's something that it just won't rot away but we're talking about a life that's going to come in us and keep us from being corruptible in other words satan can no longer corrupt us and the church world as we would call it formal and religion as we will hear our messenger uh describe as denominational fiction it had become corrupted in other words for different reasons they no longer stayed with the true resurrection message of easter they for money for popularity for crowds for many a number of reasons they left the true message of easter or of the resurrection the real message that the s-o-n brought to the world when it rose from the grave when he rose from the grave there was a message in it remember the seal was broken and the message was because i live you shall live also because i resurrected from the grave so shall you resurrect from the grave and we know that there's a rapture and or a translation the scripture calls it but even that translation is a resurrection from the grave of this body because no matter what age you're at you are years begin to pile up and finally this dust can no longer hang life and we drive down the roads and we find graveyards everywhere because that is the mark of sin every graveyard tells man that they're living in sin every graveyard tells man that they left eternal life every graveyard and and uh so it doesn't matter whether they spread your ashes or and those aren't the subject things that we're talking about but what we're talking about is a escape from corruption and that is a present tense okay something that god is doing us now that we can know that we possess eternal life and we can have the hope and the comfort that if they put this body it will rise again because i live and we know our scripture in romans 8 that says simply it says if the same spirit that be in christ jesus dwell in you it shall quicken your mortal body by that same spirit and so that's what we're talking about is that that the the light that has come up that so that we know that if there has to be a light to bring a seed to life and god showed us that program and what his plan was in the very words that he spoke let there be light and we covered that as we listen and he talks about this light begin to shine so the s-u-n came up god said let there be light the sun became into existence i don't know how that transpired but it he said let there be light and there was light and that light shined on the waters and found the seed and brought the seed to life and every scene manifested he said now there had to be an s-o-n to shine to go forth and to find all the life and spiritual life and spiritual seed and bring them to life now we know that the church world went into darkness and this is what we've really got to come to grips with if and i just say this as honestly as i can why that there had to be this message because the church world and denominational world was no longer providing the light the s-o-n that would bring the spiritual seed that is in you to life we're not worried about politics we're not worried about these nations we're not worried about this world we need to understand one thing we've got to come to the knowledge and understanding and satisfaction and assurity that the seed that's in us has been brought to light and that we are new creatures in christ jesus and we have this life in us and it's time i mean i as i've been listening to this sermon i've actually uh i am in questioning my myself do i have this life it's if it's too late to to worry about my position or my popularity or anything uh of of that nature it's it's got to come down to where that is something genuine that i know that i've got and uh so we're going through this and we're taking our time in it because we want to understand what it is what it's here well this message if this is what he says it is the rising of the sun in other words in this dark lady ocean age that had completely gone to apostasy had put god on the outside of the church they're no longer preaching resurrection they're no longer preaching holiness they're no longer preaching the move of the holy spirit they're they're no longer preaching that that the power of god exists that there's a holiness and a standard to live by they've left all those things down and are preaching some fiction that someday jesus is going to come flying down out of the sky airplanes are going to fall out of the sky and we are going to uh we are just going to be taken up just based on our church association and brother mike i love what you brought this morning i thought that was so awesome i just wanted to come out and let you keep going and that's what he said he said god didn't call us to come to church he called us to be a church and so the the fiction it was great and men associated together intellectually they associated together in fellowship they associated together in doctrine but they were never possessors of the same spirit that he had now that's a statement to say do i have the same spirit that was in jesus christ in me because if i have it it'll do what it did for him now i believe it okay but i want to go beyond belief i want to go to possession and i uh this is david mcgeary speaking i don't believe you take possession of it all at once i believe it's brought to life because the church went into the ground and came up god is an evolutionist and i believe he's we are coming to a place where we're hungering we're thirsting we're crying out we want to have this in our life and he's calling us from all walks of life all different places all different jobs all different churches all different positions and he's bringing us into this light so we can be saturated you've got to be saturated in the light you've got to sit in that light just like sitting out in the sun until it bakes you you've got to really get into it in depth so we're going to start this morning where we left off and just to tell you you know these are from where we left off it was is right here and this is almost every page you know in these next few pages is just loaded with things that are brought to life and so as we listen to this brother the prophet of god there's a very um i don't i don't want to use the word subtle because i've discovered that there's nothing that the prophet of god says that's subtle once it's revealed it's like a massive headlight but he talks quite a bit in here uh maybe a terminology could i use his underline about the witnessing of the church and the display of this life we'd i hope that you can pick up on some of those things as he also talks to us in this little section about the sharing of this life so we're going to listen i think it's about 19 minutes or 20 minutes this morning and then we're going to go back through so if if you have uh i i believe nowadays you can have little i don't know if they're laptops or uh phones and all those things we are listening and going to read from the message it is the rising of the sun and this morning we left off at paragraph 43 before and now we're going to pick up on paragraph 44. last sunday evening we talked about uh the going this our seed being in the earth and uh but uh and so we're just gonna pick up from right here we're gonna listen from paragraph 44 to the end of paragraph 80 and then that's a good breaking point because the prophet of god begins to move into the sheaf offering and some other great things so let's just sit back this morning let's put your spirit in the mind of listening if you have a listening aid like maybe if you don't speak english and you can find this message in french or in spanish and you can read along we'll have it on the board and just pay attention for this 20 minutes and let's see the the food that's in here you know if i could just use a real carnal type it's like going down one of those great big smorgasbords you know what i mean there's so many plates up there and if you just run down and make one pass you know you only get a few items well we're going to just go down and and see if we can take maybe some items that we've never caught before and feed on it but remember this morning every bit of what we're here for is about the lord jesus okay and it's not just jesus the man that walked 2000 years ago it's jesus the word that is eternal there's not three gods there's only one god and that god was manifested and became flesh in the man called jesus christ who is the only mediator between us and god but the same spirit that was in jesus was the spirit of the father the spirit of god that spirit was manifested in flesh and then he set that spirit back he sent the spirit back upon us that we could be possessors of that same spirit that that same spirit would do in us what it did in the lord jesus so god bless you this morning i hope the food of god's word nourishes your soul this morning again keep me in prayer brother billy is going to take the evening service i'll be in missouri and next weekend and so but let's just take a few moments this morning and enjoy god's word i don't know what time it is now but we'll just have a few moments of fellowship amen is everybody okay and loving the lord love this message it's wonderful god bless you now today we have a tuberculosis easter seal people send a message one to the other and to support this great fun or drive for the doctors and medical sciences to work upon something to retire or to help the tuberculosis they are sealed what we call an easter seal when we send message one to another but when we receive the message that seal is broken because the seal is what's got a message bound on the inside and now the true easter seal on this sunrise was broken and the secret of life after death was revealed before that time we didn't know the world uh grouped in darkness groped around man suspicion theories was among man's heart tradition made up man worshiped idols they worshipped the sun they worshipped all kinds of gods and all kinds of people that made claims they all went into the grave and they stayed in the grave but the real seal has been broken and one who once lived as we live died as we will die was risen from the dead what a morning never one like it in all the history of the world the secret was made known that he was both resurrection and alive and he said when he come forth on that morning because i live you live also not only was he the beneficiary of the resurrection but all those seed that was resting in god's great province was a benefactor of that resurrection to life because he said because i live amen ye shall live also that was the breaking of the seal because he was brought up so will everyone that's in christ be brought up with him at this glorious sunrise god had proven or vindicated his word all the glooms and doubt that have moved in people's minds was taken away because here was he who once lived eat drinks and fellowship with mankind that said i have power to lay my life down i have power to raise it up again and now not only had he made the statement but he proved it to be the truth oh what a glorious thing that is i'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was because he raised from the dead we also have already raised from the dead while we were in him notice now as the gloom covered the earth and the seeds could not live without the s-u in their eyes and gloom had covered the earth and now the s-o-n was risen and all gloom was vanished by this light as it spread across of the nations to the people that he is not here but he has risen what uh what a statement he had proved his word he had proved it be to be true for he had now conquered death hell in the grave the trinity of the devil this hell and the grave or satan is the author of death he is the possessor of hell and also the great and that was the trinity of satan being caused by one thing that was death death you go up the grave and being a sinner you go to hell all the very one thing the trinity of satan which was death that had helped man in captivity all these years but now the true trinity of god being one manifested in christ who was life and it broke the seals and conquered the enemy and rose up the one true and living god i am he that was dead and i'm alive forevermore has a jesus death in hell in one made man and dwelt among us and conquered every enemy and it proved that the trinity of satan was conquered and if the trinity of god was made known because only god alone had power to bring life back again he was that emmanuel god had been manifested in the flesh no wonder he could claim there matthew 27 chapter all powers in heaven earth is given into my hand i send you to be my witnesses to all the world he had conquered both death hell and the grave not only did he do that and caught out triumph with all the power in the heavens and earth all that was the father all that was the holy ghost and all that there ever was was in him all powers in heaven and earth is given unto me everything else is powerless he had conquered it now and then not only that he sent word to his disciples just believing fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore have the keys to stand in hell i've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every for our same predestinated seat of god shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age it'll bring forth the crops that god are dangerous to do he is raised from the dead oh what a wonderful thing that is i am alive or quickened the word means the word quicken the greek word means that something that's made alive after death like the the seed that goes into the earth it has to die every bit of the seed it has to rock every bit of the seed and every bit of the life that was in the seat has to come forth again he was quickened not only that and will send the same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you to quicken you that where i am there ye will be also in luke 24 chapter 49 first he said behold i send the promise of the father upon you but tarry are weighty in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from ohio to show that not only did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared those benefits he come to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that god came before the foundation of the world and put their names in the book of life and here they are on the earth without a hope he came not only to be the blessing but to share the blessings with every predestinated seed now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth and also traumatized no matter how long it's kept in darkness it'll come forth when the s-o-n shines upon it notice now he come to share it with us no wonder the gospel is good news the very word gospel means the good news the good news was if a man died for our sake that's good news if christ was born that's good news but never a news never was there news like this news that he who made the promise has confirmed the promise and he's alive forevermore and had the keys to both death and hell in his hands all the gloom was shook away there was no more gloom to be seen for the sun was up from the grave there was no oh he will come or he may come he had already come the gospel good news notice the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he is risen go tell my disciples that i am risen from the dead meet with them to confirm this to them oh god how in this last days there shall be light again across here i'll prove to my disciples don't tell them that i am not dead and i'm not a tradition but i am a living christ amen i'll meet them take this message to my disciples that i'm risen from the dead the gospel good news you say is that right hebrews 13 8 said he's the same yesterday today and forever we as beneficiaries are to prove his life is in us now the beneficiaries of this life the life he never was a life lived like it he was the son of god and he died and that shut it out but when he raised again from the dead on easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person that he is a living and how can we do it by word only or it is written the gospel can not by word only but through the power and the manifestation of the holy spirit to prove that he is alive now if there is another gospel that paul spoke to one of the groups i am so surprised that you turn to another gospel which is a leather a make-believe gospel to a denominational fiction turning from that good news and because i live ye live also and i live in you and the works that i do john 14 12 the works that i do will identify myself in you what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology but in the evening time there shall come light again there will be a resurrection in the evening time it shall be like at the evening time now the very essence of the message that was sent that he is risen from the days we his beneficiary we who share the resurrection with him draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it for some traditional man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to i'm afraid today that too many of us are not getting people to christ we're getting them to a church to a theory but we must get them to christ he is the only one and the only one that has life he that has a son has life and if the life of a man is dead be projected in you you will live the same life he is if the blood of a man was a certain type you took the blood from one man and changed the blood of one man into another he'd absolutely be that typed blood and if your spirit that's in you is reconciled and you are anointed with the life that was in christ is upon you romans 8 11 says if the spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you it will also quicken your mortal body that same life then paying powers from beneficiaries that he had here on earth from god he redeemed you a seed that was for known by god whose names was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and that gospel light of the resurrection the confirmation of the words how do we know he was a crisis because he proves what he talks about todd i know the message of the hour god proves what he promised that he talks about that is the identification that we are of beneficiaries with him in the resurrection he proves what he's talked about what he promised to do in christ he proved on the resurrection what he promised to do in the days of moses he proved it what he promised in the days of enoch he proved it in all the days of the apostles he proved it now i understand he proves what he said because they are a part of that seed that was represented on the book of life that he came to redeem back to god again what a message by easter morning not only did he raise but his beneficiaries raised with him they were in crime at his crucifixion they were ending at his resurrection we are of his beneficiaries quicken after being dead in darkness in a darkened world of unbelief or churches and denominations and so forth have drawn us out and there's something in us calling old we want god we're hundred and thirsty for god we join the methodist baptist pentecostal presbyterians what more still there was something wrong we just couldn't find it yet and all others couldn't while we was groping in darkness a great resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word of god like he was the manifestation of the promised word of god i will not leave his soul in hell neither will i suffer my holy one to see corruption amen he manifested in every word of god that was promised to him he proved it when he raised on the easter morning ah them who were once groping in darkness and wandering around if they should wash feet on this day or if they should keep a certain day or do a certain set of rules all those things passed away for that was a glorious resurrection that defied every man-made thing that man had ever done every man-made reason there had never been to that time a man that could lay his life down and pick it up again he defied that scientific proof they had by raising again when they say that jesus christ isn't deceit yesterday forever that his power isn't the same that his gospel isn't the same when the bible says it's the same god defined our denomination number creed and he moved forward with his holy spirit as he promised has proved it to us that he is alive we are the benefactors of his resurrection quickens after being dead in the world and sin and trespasses he is quickened us together with him raised with him now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus his brain is spirit brings his same life again on the earth if the spirit of god that raised up christ the body the anointed bloody if the spirit of god anointed that body in such a way that when that seed fell into the earth he just wouldn't let him rest there no no he quickened him and raised him up that same spirit by the same works by the same power by the same signs being you he'll also raise you up that was gospel meat right there wasn't it amen amen let's just take a couple moments and and uh just walk back through this a little bit and emphasize some points that you know it kind of might be a blessing to us and um you know when you really like something and you're starting to feed on it you notice you'll slow down your bites and you'll chew it a little more you know and just did it spooned it in to move on you know and uh i was at a lovely housewarming the other day and they had some like side of a salad like a cabbage salad with raisins you know so i asked if i could take some home because i didn't want to just eat it that one time i wanted to feed on it again well they gave me a whole tray of it so i'm just feasting away and so you say well it's the same thing but it's so good you just keep eating it you know so let's just take a moment and i i thought that uh just um you know we're only 11 pages into the book so we know that uh that but as we noticed in the first few paragraphs 45 he said that man never knew really the secret of life after death you you understand so you say well there's been people that appeared in the bible uh they they did appear but the only record you had of that was the person that gave the record and he went into the grave and then that record had no other voice or no other witness because he was his own witness am i making sense to you so if i told you i saw a flying saucer the only thing the belief that you have in that flying saucer would have to have come from me and then if i died there was no record of that being existent so my testimony died with me so that allowed man always to have a question about life after death but when he rose from the dead that answered the question forevermore that i am i am he that was dead i was he that is the dead and alive forevermore so when he rose from the dead it just wasn't become a historical fact that he rose from the dead but now he's alive doing the same things that he did when he was on earth but now he's not doing him from earth he's doing them from his resurrected position so we know he's still alive because we see the works of his resurrection working and and being performed so he put a end to the question is there life after death for this body and so we saw a body liken our body that ate with us drank with us died the way we die come up and prove from where that he is from where he resurrected to to that he's still alive doing the same things so now the questions answer and we can look and say we know he's there in that place that's the place that we're going i don't want to resurrect back to this place you know what i mean praise god for a new heavens and a new earth a new place to go to but you understand the proof of the resurrection quest the works that i do shall you do also the church world put an end to that so there was no longer any proof of the resurrection there was just a hope so oh i hope there's a heaven i hope there's life i hope i make it i hope i've done enough good works but what he's trying to let us know is that you can have that question answered in your life forever because i will give to you the same spirit that quickened me put an end to the question so let's just go back to this a little bit because he said that was the great uh a seal that he said that was broken they broke the seal of the question of life after death does anybody have any question that this is not your existence you don't die this is not the body you're meant to live in there's more to your life than this 50 60 70 80 years whatever god gives you we're not living for here this is satan's kingdom and he's trying to get you to build it and when you die he's done with you he throws you into hell because that's his possession so he kills you with death and he throws you into hell boy sounds like somebody i want to work for wouldn't you rather work for somebody that's going to give you eternal life that when this world's over and all their science corrupts it and burns it and infects it and and starves it and and and it's ruined that you know that you've got another land another life another joy another peace that this it ain't over i don't want to end up a statue oh here's a monument to george washington well where's george well you see that river he threw a dollar over the river he chopped down a cherry tree what good does that do me what good does it do you've got to we by god's grace reveal to us the reality of life after death that's what jesus brought that was the message that was the seal hey everybody there's life after death this is not what you're seeing it's denominational fiction there really is a heaven there really is another kingdom look let me tell you something if you look at this mess and think that our great god created this then there's something wrong with your understanding of god look into those skies look at the sun look at nature the invisible things of god are clearly seen in the creation around us [Applause] not man-made science brick and mortar which is a perversion of them taking what god's made and turning it into something else that they made and it never lasts i've walked in europe i've walked places i walked through jerusalem and saw those great roman cities and those great ruins and and the archaeological digs they're digging 20 and 30 feet in the ground and finding things that used to be on the surface which shows you all civilization goes to the grave buried all the ships that used to sail the seas are underneath it i don't want to go with this life this life goes to the grave i don't want this life my life will not carry me over it takes divine life and that divine life's a gift of god so as we read there that's the seal that's what we're talking about that's what the rising of the sun told us there's life after death don't get hung up on this life and then he makes this statement paragraph 49 he says i'm sure this morning that even we who believe it cannot comprehend what a great thing that was lord increase my understanding make it shine brighter make me understand what a great thing it is that you shared with me there's life after death and as we begin to go down and and look at this these great things he says in in 51 he's talking about the trinity of the devil death hell and the grave and he he says and that's the trinity of satan being caused by one thing that was death death you go to the grave and being a sinner you go to hell that's the trinity of satan in other words this is what satan has to offer you you die i bury you and you over there go to hell that's what satan has to offer you ever hear the expression you know what you get if you work your fingers to the bone bony fingers how many times have i got on this and lifted something and put all my back into it and everything and 15 years later my back reminds me of the time that i overworked because i was some sort of muscle man and i got the job done for who i've worked 45 hour weeks for guys i worked that and when work got slow goodbye i'm done with you do you understand when you're no longer worthy for satan to use you he's done with you do you understand that's the trinity of satan you die you go to the grave you go to hell isn't that wonderful oh i am going to live for that please get me a career please get me something where i can work 60 70 hours a week and drive a car for a short season can they come and take your license away because you can't read the signs anymore or like somebody somebody was talking the other day they said you know brother randy just talked to the church and mention everybody lusting after the pastor's truck well so much for my truck it's the trinity of satan you know a trying court's hard to break but and so that's what he says he says and that held man in captivity all these years you understand if you don't have this life you are captive to the trinity of satan in other words there's no way to break that cycle of living dying the grave and hell he had every man captive until this day and that was broken and then he says now in 53 no wonder he could claim there in matthew 27th chapter all power in heaven and earth is given un to my hand i send you to be my witness to all the world now i didn't want to miss that because there's a few more statements we're going to make here because he's telling us something he said i send you to all the world so if you believe that and it's been revealed to you you will tell people hey there's life after this death you are in captivity to the triune plan of satan to take you to hell but there's one who's come who broke that chain and will give you the life that you can have victory that's right well probably because he's talking about giving a witness because he what so we're starting to see here and i said this is sort of the underlying thing is that there's there's a portion of that belongs to us when we become the voice of this message so every believer that is convinced is concerned and they become the voice of of the message now we know the message in our day is that the same resurrected life was sent over the gentiles to bring god's seed to life because the denominational fiction couldn't do it so let's just go here and he he says this in let's look at paragraph 54. he says now then not only that he sent his word to his disciples his his believing fear not for i am he that was dead and is alive again forevermore and i have the keys to death and hell i've got the keys to death in hell i've already conquered it don't fear anymore for every four days predestinated seed of god shall come to life when that light spreads across the earth of the glorious gospel in every age so that's what he said i'm going to shed this light i'm going to take this light this news this quickening power this spirit of life that brings the seed that's in you to life and breaks that captivity that's going to shine in every age now we can't be concerned with the ages gone by but i can be concerned about the age that i'm living in the light that was sent in this age to quicken the seed and bring it foreordained to life in every age it'll bring forth the crop that god ordained it to do now let me ask you this not in condemnation but ask yourself am i in that crop or you you know what i meant uh um am i in this camp or am i in that camp i'm of this political persuasion i'm i'm part of this cause i'm part of this or or i'm part of that because it's to it's to bring us to life to the cause of christ to the witness so in other words god's ordained seed that's brought to life now has that same message that's now their message it's not a message of social justice there is no social justice in a world that brings you to hell or the grave man will destroy one another they will hate one another they will imprison one another they'll put themselves in slavery they'll do ethnic cleansing they tried to kill the jews the cambod the cambodians tried to kill the poor in africa they had genocide in this country they had racial division and racial hatred hatred is a fruit of the devil it's a part of the threefold chain of satan and there's only one message that sets anybody free and that's the life of jesus christ being in a man whether he's black blue brown green yellow or whatever he is life comes from christ and from christ alone you're not going to change it hell is the end of anyone that does not possess the same spirit that jesus possessed no man can serve two kingdoms that's what we just read and that's what it quickly means means for that life that message to be brought alive in you you can ask yourself well we'll just read it but is that message alive in me okay let's not worry about what anybody thinks let's not worry about where you should be or where you shouldn't be let's just ask ourselves do i have that life in me well that's why i feel it's a growing life i'm not satisfied with the life that's in me i'm not satisfied with the things that are in my life that i know shouldn't be there okay but now i can press for the higher calling because i make a decision because the realization now is real that i've got to choose this day who i'm going to serve i i can't i i i i can't be lukewarm i can't try to mix this together and mix that together and and it takes a personal death and maybe in a a while i'll go more into my personal side of those things he says so as we read down he says now let's take we're going to read these next three paragraphs and let's just spend a few seconds on it paragraph 57 57 he was quickened not only that and will send the same life that quickened me the power that brought me from the grave i will send it upon you to quicken you that where i am there ye will be also so now this is a promise i will send this same power to you now i like what brother mike was saying in his his exhortation we don't want a substitute we're not talking about a worship substitute or a church substitute we're talking about a personal possession and the results of that possession so that possession ain't going to give you an in and out life it's not going to be stoned and wrecked one day it can and back up believing and shouting it's going to take root where it brings this body under subjection so when it comes in it starts to work on you it's not microwave religion it starts to conquer remember how he said the he grant conquered how he conquered he said one city at a time one challenge at a time one mind battle at a time that life starts to go and starts to conquer you starts to conquer your mind it starts to conquer your body it starts to conquer your actions it starts to conquer your work it's a resurrection life coming alive like it did from the grave through the churches till we saw the first fruits of it manifested in our generation it's a conquering but i want to know it's working so look what he says he says it it it where i am there ye will be also in luke the 24th chapter and the 49th verse said behold i send you the promise of the father upon you so we just read what the promise was i'm going to send it unto you but now let's listen closely it says promised upon you but tarry or weight ye in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high may i say it this way may you be endued with that power from unhi he says to show that not only did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared those benefits look don't understand you hear me preaching i'm preaching to myself but there's got to be something in me we call the deep calling to the deep we say we're the seed but let me tell you something the seed calls for the life and that's what he says tarry ask for it desire it it doesn't matter if i'm a wreck i'm a wreck if i've got the world in me i've got the world in me i can't change where i'm at but i can cry out rabbi have mercy on me hold out son of david have mercy on me i can be the little woman that reaches out and touches the hem of his garment lord i need your life she knew that he possessed power that would heal her but she made a new move to it she made a call for it she reached out and touched the hem of his garment she made contact with it and that's who you i don't care what your struggle is i don't care what your sin is but what i do care is are you asking god to put that life in you because there's no big eyes there's no little use there's nobody cleaner or better than anybody else but there's one thing we need we need the gift of god [Applause] amen give it to me lord give me more of it let it have conquering power in me i need the spirit of god to conquer david mcgary [Music] not a time to get lukewarm it's not a time to run off the field it ain't a time for pleasure it's a time to get busy for the kingdom of god with the little bit of life you've got left [Applause] never seen a people that want to run off you don't retire from the gospel the fire grows bigger and bigger and bigger i don't care where you live in the flesh that has nothing to do with it but you don't lay down your witness and i know everybody just wants to say oh i'm just going to live the light and let my life shine let's just read on he comes to redeem to bring to life those predestinated seed that god seen before the foundation of the world and put their name on the lamb's book of life and here they are on the earth without hope he came not only to to to be a blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated seed now if the seed wasn't on the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth and also germatized no matter how long it's kept in darkness it'll come forth when the s-o-n shines upon it notice now he come to share it with us it doesn't matter how long you've been in darkness you can be in this message and be in darkness darkness is any place that that s-o-n isn't shining brother david are there dark places in your life yes i am not saint david i don't want a statue i don't want candles i want the lord to take rule over every part of my life and every desire if it means i never draw drive another nail or ever cut another board or ever make another deal or ever do anything lord i'm willing to lay it down not i'm willing to fit it in that's just where we are now i know ministers have different things that they've got to give their life to but every individual is individual so we we see that that that part of getting this light is for you to call for it so if you see that there's some place lacking call out don't don't fill that spot with education i don't mean worldly education i mean message education get to the place where you know that you are in a good personal relationship with the lord that you talk to him and he talks to you and he proves his word there's nothing wrong with you lacking there's nothing wrong with you being sick when you get sick what do you do you pray for healing if you have not what do you do you ask don't go justifying yourself don't say well i've done all these good things i've done this i've served the lord for 50 years i've got a lot of converts when i find myself looking back at my works to justify my present state that's the first sign your backslid i don't care about yesterday i want my tomorrow to be victorious i want my tomorrow to possess more of that life i want my tomorrow to be have more proof of the resurrection the proof of the resurrection in me let's stay with that thought and move just to paragraph 61. notice the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he is risen now i'm just going to jump ahead so we can deal with this thought many of us look and look at brother branham and say brother branham prove to us that's the message brother branham did that brother branham did that but brother brown comes back and says in just a few paragraphs if the spirit of somebody is in you you will do the same thing that he did and if the blood was transferred then you would have that person's blood so if we've got the same life how many believes the life that was in our prophet messenger is the life of christ so much so that he fulfilled luke 17 30. he said to prove to the people that he's risen go tell my son my disciples that i've risen from the dead and i'll meet with them to confirm it to them he will meet with you to confirm it to you oh god how in this last days there shall be light again across the earth not only was that the ministry of the son of man revealed in our prophet but it's the life that that sun brought to life the seed life that that light shined was brought to life now that seed becomes a light and it shines because it's the same resurrected life brought to forth in you and i'll prove to my disciples go tell them that i'm not dead i'm not a tradition but i'm a living christ i'll meet them take this message to my disciples i am risen from the dead i will meet them that is god's promise to every seed i will meet you lord you want to meet me i'm a wreck i got so much religion wrapped on me i know most every answer to every question i you know i'm a sadducee i'm a pharisee i'm a priest i'm a preacher i'm all that stuff wrapped in one you still want to meet with e-yeah i want to meet with you your name's on the lamb's book of life so you're on my appointment book and you can keep running i would rather have a closet experience than a road to damascus experience but i'll meet you i'll change you it's my word i i will certainly do that now listen just to this as we're talking about we know about a meeting we know that we're the witnesses we know that we're to prove that he's risen he says this 62. he's the same yesterday day and forever we are as beneficiaries and are to prove his life is in us now we are to prove that his life is in us now the beneficiaries of this life the life there never was a life lived like it he was the son of god he died and it was shut up and when he raised again from the dead on easter morning then we as his servants are commissioned by him to go into all the world and bring this good news to every person that he is a living and how can we do it by word only for it is written the gospel came by not word only but through the power and the manifestation of the spirit that proves that he lives now these are simple requirements and i don't want to say it like requirements because you can't you can't manufacture it okay but if you have it you've asked for it you've sought it out and you've got it then it manifests itself by you sharing it with others so this is the life then he makes this statement there is is there another gospel is there another gospel than this what we're talking about this morning that i have made contact and emma zesser and jesus gave me the same life that he had this is why pentecost religion was such a deception because it made the holy spirit out to be a third person and a different anointing so we could have our life and the holy spirit life but this life is a oneness now i know the shape i'm in and i need i know more of that life and i'm sure each of us probably has spots in our life that we're not pleased with but let's ask him to come to those places he's not here against us he doesn't want to see any of his children perish but he's longing for his children to invite him behold i stand at the door and knock open up i will come in and help you clean house i will come in and sup with you on others i will come in and supply the nourishment the spirit the grace for you to be able to overcome this weakness in your life remember he plants he finds he nourishes and feeds no he plants he finds he quickens he nourishes and feeds and he harvests he's here for us we're almost coming to the end of our comment is there another gospel i'm surprised that you've turned to another gospel there is no other gospel but a make-believe gospel either i'm a make-believe gospel or i've got the real thing i'm not ashamed to say wait a minute there's parts that i'm faking i'm willing to expose myself publicly even to the tone of critics or people that might want to comb through my life to see if they can find my weaknesses but god's giving you an opportunity to go to him in private that's how important it is it's a make-believe gospel it's a denomination of fiction that's turning from the good news what's the good news i will give you my life the same thing that i have i'll give to you all we've got to do is say i want it i'm going to wait for it i'm going to tarry for it i'm going to ask for it every day if you have to feed it to me little by little because if i took the whole thing at once i'd blow up i'm happy with that give me life let me grow and i'm not driving you to conviction i'm not driving you to look back at all the things you've done and all the nasty things you brought into church with you this morning i'm trying to tell you you can ask and you can receive because he's alive that's what he said here and in 64 he simply says the works that i do will identify myself in you what a message it shall be light at the evening time amen who is that light what's the last light you are the light of the world you are the salt of the earth lay for yourself a pattern of good works that your good works might glorify the father in heaven this is the same gospel that jesus preached paragraphs uh uh so we we see we are to prove that the life is in us that the with the works that i do shall you do also in 65 he says now the very essence of the message was sent that he has risen from the dead we are beneficiaries who share the resurrection with him now listen to this draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he is alive see we want to draw all the benefits of the life but you only draw the benefits when you start to prove to the world he's alive if the wages of sin is death the wages of good works is life show me your faith without your works and i will show you my faith by my works we draw benefits or we draw from this life as we try to prove to people that he lives so you want to you want to really be a christian you want to make the right stand you want to have the right nature you want to say the right thing you pray about it you want to prove that christ is living in you when you get to that then he feels that power he sends that quickening and he makes that alive all you got to do is ask it's real simple don't make it complicated don't judge yourself out of the picture don't think your past no matter how long it's been there if it's there it's there if it's coming to life now let it live there's a lot of people in this message that aren't born again let's get them born again it's not something you're going to be feared into it's going to when that word comes to you and you say wait a minute it's real i don't have it something in me wants it and i ask for it and i tarry for it and you shall you've been baptized you shall we draw benefits from this by proving to the world that he's alive we cannot do it by word only we cannot do it by some tradition of man we only reflect exactly what we're pointing to that's powerful i mean i i just sit back what am i pointing to and then i realize brother branham asked the question what are you pointing to he makes in one sermon he says there's too many things pointing to too many other things that was the one thing that made the i would say brother ram stand out he never begged for money he never tried to build an organization he never tried to build a great big this and a great big bat but he was so steadfast with his finger pointing to one thing you've got to have the same life that was in christ in you carry for it he will give it to you you say i'm a sinner repent and be baptized and you shall receive the promise of the father the gift of life you say i've been baptized then wait on it call on it start applying the token purging yourself making your life better where he can come in but whatever you do get it let's read paragraph 69 we he talked about that blood type right before it if your spirit that in you is reckoned dead and you are anointed with the life that was in christ is upon you and so god's not taking your life away from you but he's manifesting himself in the person that he made you so his anointing is upon you romans 8 11 if the spirit that raised christ from the dead dwells in you it'll also quicken your mortal bodies that same life them same powers them same beneficiaries that he had here on earth from god he redeemed you a seed that was foreign by god whose name was put on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world so it's entitled to you a promise is a gift don't run from it let's stop and surrender and make sure that we've made personal contact with that great life the same benefits that he had on earth from god listen closely 70 and that gospel light of the resurrection the confirmation of the word how do we know he was the christ because he proved what he talked about how will i know the message of the hour god proves what he promised and he talks about it a lot of people are leaving the talk about it off here the sun rises the son of man it didn't show up in john doe it didn't show up in a priesthood because melchizedek was not a priesthood that life that he wanted to transfer to the seed and the crop of this age that life was in william miriam branham i'm not taking away from the lord jesus brother branham was a sinner redeemed by the blood and he meant god under the shed blood he didn't meet god by his gift he didn't meet god because he was born and made a prophet he meant god under the shed blood of jesus christ was forgiven of his sins and from his testimony i knew in him being irish he had a temper he liked to fight you know you don't need to give any honor above him what god gave the honor god gave him is he was the first fruit of the seed that possessed the fullness of what that resurrected promise was to the believer and he was chosen to be the one that shined that light in this age that every seed could recognize the difference between denominational fiction and the true gospel of life [Applause] and we're invited by the call of the spirit and by the quickening of the conviction of god's word upon your heart to be a partaker of it but you can't separate the message from the messenger why because he's the reflection of the work that's the same thing that people that want to take salvation and not mention jesus preach the beatitudes preach sharing preach all the works and never mention jesus no i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ that's right because it's the power of god unto salvation this is where i know that i'm going to receive the quickening power to bring me to life because there's places i haven't come to yet and the sun stays with the seed all the way from its germination all the way to its harvest you you it you you can't separate it you got it you you talk about it he said we are beneficiaries with him of the resurrection he proved what he was talking about so how are we going to prove if we never talk about it how are we going to prove there's a light that shined in this day how are we going to be a beneficiary of it if we don't prove to the world what god's done everybody and even today in this message is trying to take people back to calvary and back to pentecost back to that type of holy ghost experience where the holy ghost experience of this day is the resurrected spirit that rose in jesus christ coming to you in this day in living person i don't want something that somebody else had i don't want yesterday's manna i don't want what peter had and paul had i want what god had for me in his mind before the foundation of the world that that life that was in christ would be manifested in me that's what i want you have it maybe not but praise god for this word that he can identify it to me and i can seek it because he said if you seek you shall find i don't know what i did with my glasses did i throw them somewhere what happened to him no i found him seek and you shall find all right so let's we just beautiful paragraph 69 70 and he talked about it uh i want you to be aware when sermon after sermon what god done in this day isn't mentioned and i'm not saying it's a requirement to preach the gospel i when i talk to somebody i always present the promise and then i present who fulfilled that promise that's your own individual level i i won't go there but there's a lot of things that i want the lord to help me with my spirit he said he says now in this day paragraph 17 now in this day he proves what he said because they are a part of that seed that was represented in the book of life that he came to redeem back to god again oh what a message amen oh what a beautiful message and then let's close with this reading of this paragraph this morning the darkened world of unbelief where churches and denominations and so forth had drawn us out and there's something in us calling oh we want god we're hungering and thirsting for god we joined the methodists baptists pentecostals presbyterians and whatever and still there was something wrong we just couldn't find it yet and all of a sudden while we was groping in darkness the great resurrection came to us in the manifestation of the promised word of god the manifestation of the promise of malachi 4 5 the manifestation of the promise of luke 17 30. the manifestation of john 12 revelations 3 14. it brought us to life and it let us know there is a life he's caught our attention he he's drawn us to him we've recognized that what that he is speaking about is truth that there is the ability or promise that a believer can have the life of christ in him and be free from the lust of the flesh be free from the pride of life be able to lay down his own personal goals and desires to give his life to the lord jesus and that the lord will take care of him you don't have need you'll never have to break bread he'll provide your every need he'll take care of you and he wants to enter in to not a church relationship but a husband-wife bride relationship and and i i can't emphasize especially the younger people i every believer if you want more you got to ask for more you got to tarry for more you got to do what you can do and apply the token but in doing so always hold the promise he promised to give me life and life more abundant he promised that where he is i'll be also he wants to share that spirit with me and i want it shared in my life and so we will stop here this morning and i'd like to just say and i don't know what time it is it says it's 12 30 so it's been a very long service this morning but don't don't give up and and don't be satisfied let's keep moving forward let's keep ask for more of god and and don't look around look up it doesn't matter where the world is god can do for you exceedingly and abundantly god's not angry at you for your past life because he's already has the blood over it all he's asking us to do is come out he never said go fix everything he said come out be separate and i will call you my sons and my daughters i can't do anything about yesterday but i can stand here this morning and ask god to help me with tomorrow god bless you this morning cosmic you can lead in worship please amen why don't we sing that song this morning in the morning when i rise give me jesus we

testimony of things that just happened a lot of times we know that when the word comes forth it's after that that the spirit is starting to be stirred within the people and we've seen it many times and even just just now as you know as the spirit's moving in the church brother matthew came to grab me because brother leonte which is brother cosma's dad had it on his heart felt like the lord spoke to him to grab some of the brothers to pray for brother david from his accident and just some of the things that he's been going through so they pulled him to the back pulled me to the back we just started to converse about it and then brother david asked for prayer and ask the brothers to come so we just wanted to share that where you see god deal with the man's heart grab another brother come up here to get brother david and pray for him just for the things that he's going through and some maybe the side effects from the accident so we know that god is moving and we know when the word goes forth that you can see it come into action brother david's always preaching a gospel that says we don't want it to just maybe live on the pages we don't want us to just maybe always live in the pew but may it be an action and we see that the prophet's message comes forth working still through men to allow those things that he has desire to do and fulfill so we just want to give the lord that testimony let's pray heavenly father we come to you this morning lord we see your word just perform an action in our church lord we know that when your word is spoke lord it can deal with individuals but it's when we're able to put ourselves aside our own spirits our own thoughts and let your still small voice deal with our hearts lord you performed something this morning where each of us had something that we had need of lord we believe that you feel those parts lord we believe that you speak to us lord if you're if we're if there's a young person here lord they may be dealing with things that that that a married man might be different with or or someone lord that has been in the ministry you reach us and eat each level lord and we thank you for that we thank you lord for the word that's gone and and the things that you're doing amongst our church lord we ask that you would give brother david strength lord we know that he preached his heart out and we've always been taught that the gift is that a man gets himself out of the way and it's either behind the pulpit or it's at work or it's at home wherever we are lord if we can get ourselves out of the way and let you work through us we know that the holy spirit can operate in that lord we thank you for the service and each one that played a part here we know it's not just one or two individuals but it's a body that comes together and allows these things to happen we love you we thank you for the testimony we ask all these things in jesus name amen amen amen god bless you i shall sing the song as our dismissal you guys are dismissed this morning i bless your name [Music] you are alive [Music] is [Music] see is [Music] sunday sundays [Music] reach our grace [Music] your name [Music] so [Music] you
