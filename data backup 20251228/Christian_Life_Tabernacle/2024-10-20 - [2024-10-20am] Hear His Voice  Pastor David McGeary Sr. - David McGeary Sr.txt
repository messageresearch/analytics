books of all the world and the pages can't contain the whole of all the things that you've done how that you've loved us father and how we've turned our back on you how you've kept us and yet we pursue our own faith Lord may you bring us closer to the reality of your love for us this morning because it hasn't even entered into the hearts or the minds of men the things that God has prepared for them that love him bless us this morning and help us we pray in Jesus precious and wonderful name amen amen God bless you you may be seated uh I I'd like just to uh kind of clarify so there's no uh misunderstanding uh the the Alexanders have chosen not to really have a funeral service like we normally would consider a funeral service so all that they're doing is just the visitation so the visitation is the funeral O Okay so there's not a visitation then a funeral to follow that alls are going to do is from 2 to 4 they're going to have a visitation and well we don't have too many deaths in our church because we're relatively a young congregation and God's been good to us and we certainly appreciate that but uh like you know our sister was uh uh baptized at 85 years old amen and uh all she would keep telling me all the time is I I I wish I'd have known this earlier I wish I'd have known this earlier you know and she would say my husband was trying to tell me you know but I but one day God opened her eyes amen and and it became life to her and she um she you know 86 years old I believe you know you your body just don't hold up forever and uh so she wanted to go home and I think the reason that she wanted to go home is she was solely 100% convinced there was a home to go to amen she knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was a world on the other side of this world I didn't my musicians ran off but uh I need a piano player so if I can at least get a piano player that good piano player reverse uh and so she knew that and so we're we're content with that we have a baby dedication maybe I should have said that first and uh uh so we'll do we'll have that but so anyway if you can go by there and give brother Miriam uh uh your condolences and you'll find that he's in good spirits uh they were married 65 years so that's certainly wonderful but anyway uh uh we're going to dedicate a lesle Ruth and bomi this morning brother George's daughter and uh I hope I said his name right uh so you know there's not a whole lot of lesli in the world and and uh uh you know someone said to me the other day they said you know how come in life that uh a a good woman always gets a bad man and a a a you know and uh uh you know a good man always gets a bad woman and I I I I I didn't know what to say I thought well I just said it's grace and mercy you know it's all I can say but anyway I I it's nice to have uh our brother name his daughter after sister Leslie she's been a wonderful example and I trust that all the blessings that she's been that will be in her life brother George God bless you brother George and everybody sister God bless you so much a beautiful girl here let's turn right over here kids so we can look this way and everybody take your picture okay here you go there you are what a lovely family Amen brother George would you say a prayer over your daughter and dedicate her to the Lord this morning amen it's okay sis he's going to be a little preacher so he wants the mic amen go ahead let's all pray together Heavenly Father Lord Jesus I'm so happy and we are gratefully thanking you for the gift of life you add in the family I praise your name I give you honor and I bless you Lord because you are so worthy you love us so much your love to me Lord oh God I going to thank you for it Lord I seean my daughter to you because I am unable to protect her to give her life but you are the author of everything Lord so I commit her to you Lord bless her and let her be favorite in this earth thank you for everything and I thank you for my wife lordet Lord I Thank you you for Sheron I thank you for Jey and be blessed in Jesus Christ name pray amen amen let us pray our gracious heavenly father as we dedicate Lesly hope this morning Father we ask that you would be so mighty in her life may she be a joy may she be just peace and help and father we just commit this family into your name and trust that you'd be so marvelous on their behalf May the joy of the Lord be their portion father we dedicate this child back to you for without you we can do nothing we ask these things in Jesus name we pray amen amen God bless you [Music] oh bring them in bring them in bring the little ones bring them in bring them in bring the little ones to Jes amen amen so we trust the Lord blessing this morning is a wonderful testimony I I don't want to short the word at all but we I know we don't want service to get too long but um I do have a few little things on my heart and I hope that with your help that uh you can help me uh bring this to morning you know you operate the gift you know so we trust that uh the word would encourage your heart and that you would have a pull in you that something inside you reaches out for the word of God and and so let us stand we're going to read a few scriptures this morning and and uh hope that we can tie this thought together in a a manner that uh will bless us and I want to also play this morning we're going to play 30 minutes of a sermon called hear his voice but I'd like to turn to Matthew the 13th chapter in The Book of Matthew and the 14th verse and then we'll turn to Hebrews the 5th chapter and the 11th verse now the disciples were questioning uh Jesus why that he spoke to him in Parables and and uh uh Jesus answered and and said these words he says and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou un to them in Parables and he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given what a privilege amen for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundantly but whosoever haveth not from him it shall be taken away even that he hath therefore I speak unto them in Parables because they seeing see not and hear they hear not neither do they understand for in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and ye shall not understand and seen ye shall see and shall not preceive this is the people's heart is for this people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed list at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand stand with their hearts and she should be converted and I should heal them amen and let's also turn over to Hebrews this morning and the U the uh fifth chapter of of of Hebrews and um read in the 11th verse it says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing Heavenly Father we ask you to bless your word to us in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated you know a great uh a great warning I guess I could say in the uh in the scripture uh here this morning is that um the people come to a place that they became become dull of hearing and you know the word dull uh if you would give it something that's practical uh to to get an understanding of it you if you have a dull knife or or a a dull blade that blade becomes ineffectual it it no longer it no longer uh does what it's intended to do so now you have something that's not working uh I don't know if you've ever uh some of the brothers are electricians you know sometimes we have a screwdriver that we hammer on to you know break lock nuts off or punch out holes and boxes and little Knockouts and all that and that screwdriver becames ve comes very dull and the end of it gets fat and and uh it becomes uneffectual and when somebody would you know i' say hand me a screwdriver and a guy would hand me his old beater you know and it wouldn't even fit in the slot you know what I mean and and that screwdriver is no good you know what I mean and so this this is a uh a a a warning because you have to understand all scriptures fulfill that's so to this morning this is a uh an admonishment you know what I mean a a word that allows us to hear it and then check ourselves up and make sure we're lining up because we don't want to become dull of hearing in other words we don't want to get to the place where the words that we are hearing have no effect on us they're not they're not speaking to us they're not changing our lives they're they're not shaking us from the inside they're they're not moving Us in any direction that we we we just we hear it but and we know it but it it just it it just becomes uh to a place that we don't understand what what what's the motive of behind me hearing this what what what what's the message that's in it I I come to church and that's another sermon and and all the brothers were just preaching preaching and I've heard this I know this and and everything and I'm fulfilling my duty and and and yes I can aim in that and and I think this is the the spirit that the Lord was warning his church against he said they've become dull of hearing and the prophets prophesied that this people they would hear all these things and they would hear it over and over again but it wasn't healing them do you understand it wasn't healing now it they would hear it but yet it wouldn't deliver them from their bondage it wouldn't deliver them from their sickness it wouldn't deliver them from the thing so it it became in ineffectual so when he said that you be dull of hearing and and this morning uh we we want to just approach this a little bit this morning that by the grace of God we can examine ourselves and make sure that we haven't become dull of hearing amen and it's and he he warns us it's not just hearing it's not just putting on a tape and playing a tape and say I've heard the tape I've listened to the prophet I've I I I've heard what he said and and you can actually be sitting there listening to the word and and just become numb to it so there there's not a message into it so now you're in a place of agreement and you can be in the place of agreement and be dull of hearing yes that's true yes that's true yes that's true I believe that that's exactly what I believe amen everything he says is right we should only say what he says I've got that down perfect yes sir I'm a Believer and there's absolutely no movement or change in your life and so I wanted to play the importance of to emphasize the importance to you this morning of hearing the word of God I wanted to just play a portion out of the message hear his voice and then we want to go from there and make a few comments and I'll try to make my comments brief uh if the Lord would give me Grace to to do that so I just pay attention this morning and listen to what how many believe when the prophet preaches it's the spirit of God speaking to you absolutely amen I believe it's a message yes sir and I believe it's stored up amen and and by the wisdom of God he knew there would be a people his children that were going to go through a dark and dry time and that it would be perilous days and there would be a famine in the land for the word of God there's certainly not a famine for music there's certainly not a famine for entertainment but for the pure word of God and and just as a type in Egypt when they were going to have those years of famine we've come to the time in the church age where that that famine is here and the wisdom of God went and stored up food F in the storehouse so that you could go into that Storehouse and that you could receive food but we don't want that food to become dull to us or in ineffectual to us we need to recognize the importance of it and it's not something that's gone by and I like this statement he says he says but ministers are always trying to refer back to what somebody else said way back behind them instead of what God Said do that's some tremendous thought right there he says we are climbing the tree of faith and that's what we're doing we're climbing the tree of faith and and you know and I I got to think and sometimes s uh we become critical maybe because people are at a different place in their clim but we want to get to the place where we hear his voice amen that that's what our final destination is of this morning is that each of us would examine ourselves no matter what age you are high school grade school it doesn't matter you're hearing the voice of your teacher you're hearing the voices of all these musicians all these things surely you can hear the voice of God and that's what we want to catch in our lives is are we hearing the voice of God so that that's what we because we want to climb this tree of faith and we want to climb it to where that we have such a union with him that that we know that he's speaking to us so if you would uh just with me a moment because um we hope that that this there's so many little nuggets if if you will listen and and this is the probably if I could say this his complaint to the people or his instruction to the people we do all the talking but we don't take time to hear him so would you join with me for the next 30 minutes and then if you'll help me make some comments afterwards but we're doing this in our heart this morning because we want all of us to get ready for that rapture we want the Holy Spirit to be able to move in us and to hear the voice of God and have that Holy unction and know where we stand so if Lord richly bless you we're going to start uh let us go ahead and stand and and for the reading of the word of God and our prophet's going to read from 1 Samuel the 3 chapter and he wants to read for uh the first 10 verses so 1 Samuel the third chapter and um and we'll read the the the scriptures here and uh uh uh and he he says I want to take for a text hear his voice so God richly bless you as we spend the next 30 minutes listening to this word and then I trust God will help us bring it alive in our lives amen God bless you now I want to take part a text here his voice that will do for little girls and big girls and little boys and big boys all remember the text here his voice now of you that's turning in the scriptures to 1 Samuel the third chapter this is how it reads for the first uh 10 verses and the child Samuel ministered unto the Lord before El and the word of the Lord was precious in those days there was no open Vision oh how I would like to dwell there for a minute maybe some other time It just strikes me let me just read it once again that verse and the child Samuel ministered in unto the Lord before Eli and the word of the Lord was precious in those days for there was no open Vision see what a vision is that it's a direct word of the Lord and the Lord's word was precious and it came to pass at that time when uh Eli was laid down in his place and his eyes be to wax dim that he could not see and here the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord where the Ark of God was and Samuel was laid down to sleep that the Lord called Samuel and he answered here am I and he ran to Eli and said here am I for thou callest me and he said I call not lie down again and he went and laid down and the Lord and the Lord called yet again Samuel and Samuel arose and went to Eli and said here I here am I for thou didst call me and he answered I call not my son lie down again now Samuel did not yet know the Lord neither was the word of the Lord yet revealed unto him and the Lord called Samuel again the third time and he arose and went to El El and said here am I for thou didst call me and Eli perceived that the Lord had called the child therefore Eli said unto Samuel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say Speak Lord for thy servant yth so Samuel went and laid down in his place and the Lord came and stood and called as at other times Samuel Samuel and Samuel answered speak for thy servant here the voice of God hearing his voice in that day was a rare thing see there was no open vision and it was a rare thing the real voice of God because the people had gotten away they had a church in that day that just didn't follow the Commandments of the Lord they had a a minister by the name of Eli and he had got away from God but just teaching the precepts of what the people wanted to believe if that isn't parallel to this day he just taught the people and he he uh took his choice ones and he had his sons to take the best of the flesh from their the hook out of the the offering and it just become a place where the offering was the main thing and Samuel just caress about the way that he handled the Commandments of the Lord and the real word of God was a rare thing that's the way it is today we go to church and we find the people going in and having some great drive on we want to make our denomination this year so many more bring your letter from your other church and Unite with us and slogans like a million more and 44 and all such as that c trying to outgrow the next denomination and in doing so we've let the bars down of the Bible we've got away and begin to teach different things the prophets spoke of these days that when they F teaching would teach the man's Doctrine and not God's Doctrine and we've seen so much of that and it's gone on so long until today the word of the Lord is a rare thing that someone can come and say thus sayth the Lord now we've had a lot of impersonations of that Satan is really on the job and many years gone by people were afraid to say that unless it was the Lord but today they just don't care but it's a rare thing to hear the voice of the Lord and to find a person that can say the Lord spoke to me you notice that amongst the people anymore that they hardly hear a time that when they say the Lord spoke to me when men and women used to pray all night and their homes were set in order by the book of the Lord and God was first in their home see we got too many things ahead of the Lord you can't have the prayer meeting because Mr Godfrey's on tonight you can't have the prayer meeting before we love susi's on tonight or some kind of a foolish nonsense like that that takes up the time and we don't have time to hear the voice of the Lord and those who do claim to be Christians just kneel down with a little prayer like this kind of homemade Lord bless me and my family and take care of us good night and the next morning rise and say uh just got us through the day good day we should wait on the Lord you see we do all the Talking we don't give him a chance to talk back to us that if we would pray and pray until our soul comes into the presence of God and then just relax and listen to his voice but there's so many voices today that takes the voice of the Lord away from us there's a voice of pleasure so many people are listening to that where they can go and have a good time and many of them are professing to be Christians some kind of an old rock and roll coming up they just can't listen to what God they say well I'm a Christian I read a verse in the Bible today yeah uh Jesus wept that's it go ahead but then to really get down and pray they got too many other things to do there's so many voices in the world so many things to attract our attention from God and yesterday when the wife and I had run over to the supermarket to get some groceries and I was hurrying because I was late with appointments and things and rushing real quick and there was a little boy stand there half asleep and a little old girl come along there with some little trousers on that belong to some man they had to because they were made for man and the Bible says it's an abomination in the sight of God for a woman to wear it and with the lot of this sure lips stick on and her eyes about half asleep she said where is the so and so to that little boy he said how you expect me to know she said you remember I never got in until 6:00 this morning and she wasn't over 12 years old now Jesus at 12 which was our example said don't you know I should be about my father's business no wonder the voice of God is a rare thing today it's smothered out by so many different voices so many things that dim and take away it's got to a place until it dulls our senses until we can't hear the voice of God our senses of where we are to shake oursel and realize that you are man and women and you are the creation of God and you were put here to serve him but Satan's voice and false prophets oh be modern as I was speaking a few days ago I was coming to church and I turned my radio on and I heard a program out of Louisville it said that they were teaching their children in churches to just drink moderately makinging them modern so that they won't go to the excess oh they need to teach them Christ not drinking and that will wreck and ruin and damn any home how could the voice of God speak among a family that's have Saddles with whiskey and their minds paralyzed with smoking and drinking and all night long cring man that Waits upon God comes into his presence and to come into the presence of God is just like going out early every morning when the Dew and the honeysuckles are all sweet when you come in the presence of a person like that you know they have been with God my wife said to me coming down this morning she said Billy I don't mean to say this to flow anybody but she said last night I believe her one of the night she said I set by one of the little Amish women and a little lady with a little cap on her hand she said and you could tell that woman had been with Jesus she was sweet her soul was mellow her eyes were clear there's nothing those sin or nothing to hide behind or anything she'd been in the presence of God her senses wasn't dull by whiskey and tobacco and all kinds of things of the world she was refreshed from the presence of God reading her Bible Hallelujah studying God's word but we modern Americans what we do and the false prophets behind the pull pit say that's all right I'm kind of in the notion of saying this if I'm wrong God forgive me and I'm persuaded that a lot of them don't know God the congregation will never live any higher than this pastor no wonder the scripture says these Shepherds how they have scattered the flock War unto them they are the branches that bears not fruit which will be plucked off and burned so many things to dull the senses of the people today oh but in the midst of all that in spite of every dulling and every voice that's in the world today some of them pleasure voices some of them are are sinful voices to lure the people but in the spite of every bit of that the truth of God Still Remains he that will hear my voice and come after me men and women who will hear the voice of God God still waits to speak to every individual that'll open their ears to hear God's voice if a man who isn't Pastor many times people say couldn't you do this couldn't you run over here couldn't you do this oh I love to do it but I've got to stay in the presence of God if I'm going to do the thing right amen and people say oh brother brandom's one of these isolationist that's not it I love people but there's just thousands of them but I must stay with him to find out what he'd have me tell him somewhere just listen he'll have something for you that he want you to know about Pastor don't you never get too busy but what you can stay in the presence and listen for his voice God always keeps his word and no matter how bad the times may be how much your church May teach against it Jesus Christ is still willing to speak that still Small Voice to anybody that'll listen for him he's still ready to do it if we're just quiet ourselves but we run in flustrated and say say a Pastor could I join this church what church do you come from so and so well bring us your letter oh my could I join this church oh yes come here forth and we'll sprinkle you a little bit with water and put your name on the book and you get the right hand of Fellowship well the Masonic Lodge has got a better order than that it's true the Masonic lodge and all other lodges are all right but it's still is it the house of God there's where God speaks those loges try to make you marrow but God makes you righteous to Jesus Christ his son now there's a quote of Ethics to it God has a new birth for you but listen to his still Small Voice every one of you people who profess to be Christians get yourself white before you don't let the washing hinder don't let the work hinder don't let nothing hinder don't let nobody know what you're doing just go before him get up in the woods somewhere get out on the side of the road go into the secret closet and close the door when the kids gets at school there get down on your knees you've heard all kinds of voices everywhere but gu get down and stay there until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift up it'll change you it'll make you different like it did this little Samuel it'll do something to you if you'll just do it now it'll make you what you should be it'll make you the kind of Christian that you ought to be now let's us go back off of this modern day until a day that's passed let's go back to the days of the Early times and this voice of God has come to man in all walks of life in all ages no matter if you're a farmer if you are a shoe cobbler whatever you may be God still speaks if you're a sinner if you're a prostitute Harlot if you are drunker if you are what a local church member nomin nominal whatever you might be the voice of God still waits to speak to you I'm thinking now of Moses when is already 80 years old and had 80 years of theological iCal training and he knew the scriptures he knew them well and he had a promise to him that he was going to be the deliver of his people but yet just knowing the scriptures and being a a formal church member of that modern Church in that day he tuck the thing over in his own hands and tried to do it he slew an Egyptian you see what you do without listening to God you just mess it up and when the devil this morning would say don't you be baptized another would say oh do it later one would say you better be sure you know what you're doing and other would say you're going to lose a good time the only way to settle that is go to God 's word with it but people today don't seem to want to do that and Moses he had been to the best of the rabbis but they got formal and cold he had heard the story his mother told him how that he was hid in the bull rushes and how that the big alligators couldn't get a hold of him how they floting down that stream as that little baby wor the the old alligator was just fat it's for the little children they were fat from eating them little babies they had old hook nose women police women never did have a baby didn't know how the love of a baby was or they just go out there and take and kill them little babies and throw them out in the river the more alligators will just fat on them little babies and yet God put up the mother's heart to place her baby right in death don't you see it was a type of Christ he went right into death and every one of more alligators that come up that little bitty basket going down the river you know why they couldn't do it why they couldn't eat that little baby there was an angel sitting there get away from here why God gives his angels charge to watch over over his people don't you get scared honey God's watching you the devil may try to do something to you but God's greater so alligators have to run away from that little basket and yet Moses knew all these things and yet after 40 years of training and then in the wilderness he still tried to take the thing over in his hands we know the Bible What God Says to do and yet we say well now we'll make this be this way it's just the days of Miracles are not so anymore we know we don't believe we see them anymore and we believe the days of Miracles just passed and the sprinkling is just as good as immersing and father son and holy spirit's just as good as the name of the Lord Jesus and so we'll just the rest of them is going that way so we'll just do that too Moses had been a military man and he thought that the way that he was trained as being a military man that he could just kill them Egyptians off with his hand to be just as good as doing what god did did you ever think of it everybody condemns Moses for killing one man and he come back down under the anointing of the Holy Ghost and kill the whole thing nobody said nothing about it he slew all of Pharaoh's Army but God was in it God wasn't in the first one and then Moses just Chuck full of church theology us to be the next pharaoh and we find him still not knowing god but one morning on the backside of the desert an old man of 80 years old his Whiskers hanging way down low he seen a burning bush and he turned aside to see what was going on and when he got near the bush he heard a voice God had to quien him for 40 years before he could ever speak to him and we won't stay quite 10 minutes so God can speak to us with all the rumble and Bumble we have of this day and yet Moses after 40 years stood there and in the presence of that bush and that one voice that called him he knew more about God in 5 minutes after that and all the 80 years of training had taught him it made a different man out of him it'll make a different man and woman out of you if you'll just stand still long enough to hear his voice like Samuel did stand still don't be excited if you want something of God asked him then stand still and listen see what he's going to say about it just open up your heart say what about it Lord Jesus just stay there if he doesn't answer the first five hours then wait another if he doesn't answer today then he'll answer tomorrow if he doesn't answer this week he will next week stay there till he answers hear his voice speak back in your heart and say yes I'm the Lord that Health thee that's all over you settl land I'm the Lord who forgives all thy sins now go and sin the more I don't condemn you then you can go free you're all right but you want to be sure that you hear that voice speak Moses heard it he was a changed man look at Isaiah the prophet as a young man he had it made the great favor came in them days a righteous man a good man he loved Isaiah for he knew he was a prophet and so he just leaned upon the king's arm everything he had wanted by is give it to him and every time he wanted anything mother the good king would give it to him but there come a time that the king died Prosperity always ruins people that's a hard thing to say but Prosperity takes a man away from God God spoke one place in the Bible something on this line and he said when I blessed you and gave you much when you were poor and you didn't have nothing I come to you and you hear me and you serve me but when I bless you and give you plenty then you turned your head from me that's what Amer America's done turn their heads that's what the church has done you can sit down on the corners and have the great fine buildings and the millions of dollars per placed into it and everything just as easy as it can be no wonder you haven't got time to hear God's voice but wait till the hour comes when that's took away then you'll long to hear it everything's fine now but the hours coming when it won't be that way so Isaiah he could lean upon the king's arm and he was a young man of favored fine spirit in this young man so the king loved him and one day the props was knocked out from under him the king died and when the king died then Isaiah had to go alone and then he be to look around and he found out that everybody wasn't like the king you be kicked out some of these days from these in denominational like this it'll come a time when you'll have to belong to an organization or you can't worship as you know the scripture says it will be they just make fun of you now but there'll be a time where there'll be a boycott for the mark of the beast must come you'll either belong to the confederation of the churches the Beast like it is in Rome or you won't worship at all that's what the scripture says that's when you'll have to cry like Isaiah did and he got out in the temple and he realized that he raised his hands and he said oh Lord I am a man of unclean lips you think you're good but wait till that time comes I dwell among peoples of unclean lips what did he got desperate and when you get desperate about this thing something will take place you're not desperate enough oh well I join church that settles it but you have to be desperate about it you have to really need God Jesus said blessed are they that do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled but as long as you're satisfied with the things of the world how can God ever speak to you you say God never spoke to me why he wants to but you're too filled up with the things of the world that's what's the matter with us today we put all of our time on things of the world and the pleasures of the world and give no time to God it's true pretty straight amen and we we want we want to hold that now I couldn't I couldn't preach it any better if I spent hours and days and months trying to put it together but you've got the picture right we become dull okay dull of hearing and and and we're we're not saying this for condemnation this morning we're we're we're saying these things so that that we can take heed and and climb that tree of faith and and get to the the place uh the place where we we need to be amen and and and so you know from from that that standpoint uh I just want to make some comments to you because again what what we're here to do is we want to rise up in the arms of Faith how many know there's a faith that's coming to the church called a rapturing faith you understand and and so we we read the statement and uh it's he he said he says he says instead of what God said do they're always talking about things talking about miracles talking about what God did the blessings of God and we've got to have those things those are the things that let us know that God's in our midst but this is something that comes down to you personally where where and and I I came to this by oh conviction in my heart I just meditating on my bed and I begin to think of how many things that I do that I've I just never really consulted the Lord about and his grace and his Mercy is always good he's always making a way he's always makes things work out and and we know that things work out for the good to them that are called according to his purpose that's his Mercy to us we know that his permissive will always works to together towards the perfect will but I thought well if I how would I like to C climb up above the place where God's always looking after me and always taking care of me and always fixing all my messes and everything and that's what I heard him say he said if if if you don't go with God you just end up with a mess so it's not our election that's in question here you understand that that's not what we're talking about we're not talking about continually proving to you you are the children of God you are the elect of God you are the Bride of God you're all these things you're sealed into the book that's all fine that put that on the paper believe it with all your heart but this is coming to a place where you can say God's talking to me am heck and and and we've got to hear and he says we just listened to it so beautifully he wants to speak to you personally just think of how us we just we are in our routines we're in our daily lives we do what we do day in and day out day in and day out it's like we're waiting for something to happen but but there's something that should be burning in in us God Speak to Me Here I Am Lord speak to me what would it be that you would have me to do Lord let it be done unto me according to thy will and so we're we're talking about moving in not to just the place where that it's what God's doing that we re that we rejoice in and somebody gives a great testimony and we rejoice in that or someone talk to you about all the things that God can do and and that raises your faith up and and so you run up to the prayer line and you say I heard that God does this I heard that God does that I I want that to happen to me but we're talking about something greater than that more mature than that higher up the tree of Faith than that where individuals actually have God speaking to them and they can act on the voice that God talks to their heart they can act on it and see the results I'd like us to read some statements and this is from where I'm going to get some of my inspiration this morning from hearing recognizing and acting on the word of God we already heard the first thing you got to do is hear it and then you've got to recognize it he says we know it today as the law of contrast that where there is good there is evil where there is right there is wrong and we will never know matter matter what our environment may be ever be able to shake ourselves from the presence of either did you did that settle in that's the way it is Paul said when I would do good evil is present with me you'll never be able to shake yourself from the presence of the two being there and they're both talking and they're both pulling and this is the most desperate hour that we've ever lived in and the most perilous time that we've ever lived in where just our spiritual growth I'm not talking our Salvation I'm talking our spiritual growth reaching our potential as the Sons and Daughters of God being able to change things that are around us by the faith that's in Us by the speaking of God's word and the faith to believe that God keeps his word not just an outward appearance but a living Fountain of the Holy Spirit moving within your life and not have it be a group but having it be a personal possession God speaks to me and I'm not ashamed of it he said he said because Paul said when I would do good then evil is present The Sinner will never be able to shake away from the Christian the Christian from The Sinner there will be a witness there of right and a testimony of wrong always and you make your choice you have to take one side or the other and so we know that in our Bible studies and teachings we know that every Revival has twins there's there's always these two Spirits are always present the wrong and the right in our day it's even a little more treacherous if I could use that word because in our day we have the lukewarm come on true not just the hot and cold not just the right and the wrong but in our day we have the lukewarm just that one that's a mixture of a little hot and a little cold just that luk Warmness and and God is trying to tell his elected church if you're lukewarm I will spill thee out of my mouth and in other words that's not what I want to be tasting that's not what I want to be fellowshipping with God don't want to fellowship with you as a lukewarm believer he wants to fellowship with you as a believing son and daughter of God that believes every promise in the books for [Music] me he wants to have fellowship with you like that he wants to have confidence in you and you have confidence in him he wants you to stand up and say I'm his son and he's my father not walking around to half doubt always feeling short always feeling hungry always starved out on the inside always feeling empty how what you can have refrigerator full of food and starve to death he's speaking here of Jacob and Esau he said before the either one was born God said love Jacob and I hate Esau before either of the children were born and we know that he said that it's not by works but that the law of election might stand amen so how ought we to feel do you ever stop when you read these messages and just stop how ought must we to feel I'm asking you next morning how after what you just hered how ought should we feel how should we be feel did it speak to you did it move you did it change you did it raise a something within your heart did it say to you I'm needy I'm not doing this I'm falling short here or Have We Become d all of hearing it's more than just passing play it's hearing how much do we ought to feel someone who has God speak to you and invite you to come to his table and to his home and be his son or daughter there's nothing so great as that what has God done to you he went out and found you he went out and called you he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life and now he's invited you to his house to Feast he's got so much for you and he says and you know so there's nothing greater than that these two boys if you will notice their Natures one of them was a spiritual man that was Jacob and the carnal man was Esau and they were both religious and that same thing had has took place all down Through the Ages the carnal and the spiritual now we're wanting God to speak to us not to condemn us but to correct us yes if we're we're on one side he said you have to make your choice you've got to move from what's wrong to what's right you've got to remove move from what's lukewarm to what's hot You' got to move from from lack of dedication to sincere dedication this is what he's saying he's trying to say we've got to make a move it it's time to climb up higher in faith it's time to get more dedicated it's it's time to change our lives we've got into a rut we become dull am and I say thank you God and you hear what he said he said if you'd wait and listen to God every time we do things that we don't got that clear voice from God we make a mess out of it I'm tired of making mess out of things I want to see God doing it in my life I want to see it's the hand of God I want to see it's God's way I want to live in a world world where God's moving not a a Revival meeting but A Life That's Supernatural we're a supernatural people we come from a supernatural God and we have a supernatural promises that's what we want to be a part of listen to what he says he says Esau represented the man of the earth natural religious in inclined religiously inclined he's inclined to religion religion's a part of his life he reads his Bible he prays he's got a good moral standard look at them and now we have a voice in our day telling the church there's something beyond that each of you prophet of God when he opened this tape he said this is for little boys this is for little girls this is for big boys this is for little girls oh he wasn't really changing uh trying to cut it out just for old people listen beautiful he says he was religious and kind but never able it wasn't in him to do it he couldn't do it he never was in him to be able to climb up past the things of the world the carnal things he just never could climb into that place where he could hear God he he could do everything else but to climb into that spot where he could climb above the things of the world climb above the voices of the world you just heard it do you understand what you just listen to he says there's too many voices too many distractions too many things of the world too many things taking your time too many things now he's saying now Esau he could never climb past that he can never break away from the cares of life he can never break away from the fear of protecting his own Survival he could never step out into the Realms of Faith as long as he had control of it as long as he can put his hands on it as long as that he could feel that he was in control he never could climb behind that now listen we're invited to climb beyond that we're elected to climb beyond that but we become dull of hearing Jacob he wanted spiritual things there was one thing that burned in Jacob he wanted that Birthright you understand he wanted that voice to talk to him he wanted to be in that Fellowship he wanted to be in that place that meant more to him than anything else that's what drove him now look at Esau he can never climb above it but Jacob he wanted it and if you would compare the two Jacob was Sir [Music] planner what what it's what beats in your heart he says now pay close attention to the scriptures now on this subject because I'm I'm sure it will help you now not everyone that saith Lord Lord will enter into will enter in but the one that doth the will of My Father which is in heaven that's a very immense statement that I would like to go down a road just a moment with you if you would give me the time amen not everyone that does all these works that lays hands on the sick that gives good does good deeds and excuse me does all these great things will enter the kingdom of heaven but him that doth the will of my father could I say it this way but to him that have taken the time to hear him you can do all these other things and never hear him you can do all these other things and never go to that sacred closet that side of the road that place in the woods that place down the river you can do all these things by instruction but never get to that place where he spoke to you and you carried out his will remember religions a covering everybody covered themselves with the wedding gown and now he's talking to a people because he wants to bring this people to a higher place he already knows your Believers he already already knows you believe the word of God he already knows you believe in the pillar of fire he already knows you know the Seven Seals are open he already knows you know the son of man has been revealed in this day but now he wants to take you higher he wants to bring you to that place where you go into that secret place you go beond that Veil you go into that chamber and you come out with thus saith the Lord that's what he's looking for he's got church full of church members he wants the cream of the crop to come up he wants that OB obedient elect lady to rise to the surface somebody with confidence not always wondering whether they're in or whether they're out they've settled that at Calvary they know their sins are forgiven they become different people you know if we wait along around for everybody to catch up none of us are going to go anywhere that's right it's time that the elect steps up to the call of their hour the call in their life their own position and if the other elect they will grow in their own season but we're trying to make it a Group movement you're not responsible to a group you're responsible to God and God alone and that's a quote he says that's the way it is with the spiritual believer today I want you to couch this if you would allow me he doesn't care how much you're laugh at him how much fun you make how ridiculous he has to act to the carnal mind his only objective is the birthright he wants to get to God because it's born in him he can't help it so we're talking about this spiritual believer we're talking about this person and wasn't it amazing the story of of Moses how he' done all these things but yet he still hadn't meant God what hadn't he got he hadn't got an order from God he hadn't got the purpose of his life he didn't come to the place where he knew his calling was what that what that he should do he was a Believer but one day he got attracted to a bush and when he got there when he took time to go out of his way to climb that mountain to find that presence when he got in that presence God spoke Hallelujah made him different changed everything it was and what did he say he said one word from that Bush was more knew more about God than all the 40 years he studied just think of it you say oh that's for preachers no it's not he said it was for you fact some people need to get in the presence of God so they can tell the preachers a few things no Elite group no big eyes no little 's there's thus saith the Lord and that settles it you don't ever have to worry about if you get in his presence that he's going to say something different than what's on this books in these tapes no no you don't have to worry don't worry about that in fact you'll find out that it's very Vindication of everything that's been spoken this what he said he wants to get to God cuz it's born in him he can't help it there there's a thirst in there there there there's something in there so just think of it if I could just draw a little illustration there's two worlds here's the world that Esau was in he couldn't climb out of that world and that world was a world of of census of the five senses it was the world of what he could see touch hear smell that controlled his life it was a world of education and knowledge and civilization everything that was around him everything that was affecting him everything he saw everything he felt everything he perceived in his mind that world ruled him and he couldn't break out of it he was stuck in that world but yet here was Jacob and there was something burning in his heart that there was another world another existence may I say it like this another Eden another realm where things weren't as they seemed to be it was the world of the Unseen and and that world was governed by the word of God and it took Faith to reveal this world Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God it took the word of God to reveal to him this world it took the burning bush it took Moses pursuing it and getting away and coming into the presence of that burning bush that God revealed to Moses that there was another world where he could take a stick and go kill them all Hallelujah that's the world that we're called to live in not the world world we think is we can't let what we think what we see what we F feel govern us we've got to break free from it we've got to come into His presence and hear his word and act on it but you'll never look for it if you don't believe it is without faith it's impossible to please God for they must be believe that God is and a rewarder of them that diligently seek him he wanted that Birthright that's what he wanted and a spiritual man today and a spiritual woman that's elected predestinated of God to come to eternal life if they have to sell everything they got if they have to take their names off every Church book in the nation they still want that Birthright we'll get to that Birthright in just a second if the only thing that matter it's the only thing that matters to them just get that that Birthright that's all no matter how what level they have to come on if they have to get down to the Altar and cry boohoo if they have to run through the place to go back and make things right and sell what they got or give away everything they have to become a pilgrim and a stranger it doesn't matter they want the birthright that's all they're interested in the birthright you don't blame them people they can't help it they were predestinated to that elected to it so we talk about election but what are we elected to we're elected to the birthright what is the birthright it's not the world of this world it's God's world we're the children of another kingdom we're Believers in another word we live by The Promise by these great and precious promises we're partakers of divine nature we're stuck here and we've got to find something that brings us from the bondage of this world and the sensus and our mental conditions into that realm of Faith peace Joy there's got to be something that does it and that's what ja has he wanted to get God he wanted to get to God that that that that's all and and you'll never see this world unless God opens it up to you that's right if not you'll make a false image of what you think God is you you'll come up with a a a false evidence of what it is it'll be a momentary High it'll be an excitement it'll be anything but this world we're talking about is a world where God speaks to you and you speak to him Jacob wanted it he wanted it with all his heart and if you want something you've got to pursue it Jacob wanted that verth right he was willing to do anything for it it meant everything to him I've got to have it I've got to have this world I've got to have these blessings I've got to have that relationship where religion isn't in between me and God I want to sit down at his table table I want to sit across from him I want to wait for him until it's like honeysuckle in the morning do until he speaks to me and I become different but if you're dull of hearing you don't even pursue it anymore as long as you got your religion in your job we wonder what what it is we're taking care of first are we taking care of our flesh are we taking care of our needs and yet the word of God said I've never seen a righteous man beg bread I've never seen the man that's pursued the kingdom of God with all his heart that God didn't take care of them but Esau as religious as he could be he could never let go he can never cast themselves completely into the presence of the word of God and say God speak you've got to get to that place where you're not ashamed to go before him and say Lord these are all my sins uh I just like the the Great Prophet did he finally went into the temple and said I'm a sinner I live unrighteous I live with unrighteous people our lips are profane but I want to C call into another level I want to hear you speak if you're going to want something you got to pursue it and we heard what our messenger said you got to set aside the time you got to get your heart right you got to make an effort and you hear what he said I don't care if you're a prostitute God wants to speak to you Lord he's already laid a sacrifice for your sins if you'll confess your sins he's faithful and just to forgive them all he wants you to do is go and knock on the door come unto me all year heavy laden I'll give you rest knock and it shall be open in this last day if you'll knock I'll invite you in and I'll eat the evening meal with you don't let whatever it is in the world keep you from climbing the mountain don't let your failures your battles the voices of the world keep you from entering into the realm that he wants you and he's inviting you every step you take towards him he sprinkles you with his blood like The Great Speckled Bird every step you take holy holy there's a blood sacrifice you confess your sins he's faithful and just you turn every stone you go through every part of your life you say Lord I'm not worthy but I want it I desire it I'm pursuing it it's all that I want I'm want that Birthright I want that Birthright I want whatever comes with this other world that's what I want I want to pursue it Jacob wanted that Birthright what comes with a Birthright what is a Birthright is the inheritance that you have because of your birth when were you birthed you were birthed in the mind of God before the foundations of the world and yet we've heard that so much we become dull of hearing everybody just still B battleing the world battling the world battling Satan fighting with Satan and yet you're a child of the king when that Old Devil come to Jesus you know what he said get behind me Satan it is written Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God how about the bride saying get behind me Satan Thou shalt not tempt the elect of the Living God oh know we just enter into a big fight a big battle I I just heard it somewhere the other day prophet of God said don't fight don't fight with them enter into his rest don't fight don't fight take your inheritance your Birthright you don't think you got a Birthright why don't you find out why don't you make your way to the altar why don't you make your way to his presence why don't you get into a prayer closet and get it settled you might come out of there saying you know I'm a rat I got to run to and fro and make everything right but I'll do whatever it takes I'll do whatever it takes to be back in his presence but look the church natural it's just the church carnal they'll never be able to get above that little thing of I join church if I go to church if I do the best I can that's all God requires now that's the same thing Cain done he went and made an altar he made a sacrifice brought the fruit of his land and said here it is God that's the best I've got take it or leave it that's the way the carnal believer believes today Lord I'll go to church I'll join the best group that I can I'll pay my dues to the church I'll do what's right now here's the best I can do I'll help buy some coal for the widow or I'll give the children some clothing them's all right nothing against it but that's but that's it that's all if you want to take it if you don't you have to take it now that's the attitude of the church carnal today I'm doing everything I can do I pay my ti I go to church I take care of people that's all them what what what else can I do Lord here it is it's all I've got take it or else I don't know what else I can do that's the sign of a people who have become dull of hearing the word's not affecting them anymore there there they're they're not moved to that but listen what Jacob he says but the the the church spiritual Able by Revelation by Grace he's seen beyond that and that's what I ask are we seen beyond that we've not done anything in this message but set up a great big Camp we're afraid to go forward people have used the voice of our prophet and the tapes to bind us in fear you better not move you better not seek God you better not have the spirit of God you just better listen but that's never been what the word of God said it said be not hearers of the word only but be doers of the word and I'm not going to try to preach some place else CU it's not given my charge but my charge is to to let you know that you can rise up above a carnal mind and a churchgoing life and a life of Works into a place where God speaks to you am and you hear him and you recognize it's him and you act on it that's what's given to you that's your inheritance that's the birthright that what you have by being a child of God and having your name written on the book of life you have access to every promise in the book every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line that's the birthright that's my inheritance I serve a s Supernatural God and that Birthright meant more to him than anything else what was what comes with that Birthright what's the inheritance of being a child of God what was the inheritance that you have that you were in his thinking before the foundation of the world what does that mean what comes with that well I want to know I want to know how do I get from this world to that world he said you got to wait on the Lord you've got to set aside the time to come into His presence and you've got to hear him speak he's got to open it up to you you've got to stop and realize wait a minute this world is swallowing me up it's keeping me from all my inheritance is keeping me from my Birthright the things that are mine because of who that I am that's not something you earn when I get my inheritance it's not what I earned it's what my parents earned for me it's what they left me what did Jesus earn for me at Calvary what is it that he left me what what did he give me what did he say was mine he said little children it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom I go to prepare a place for you if it were not so I would not tell you I come again that where I am you may be also not future where I am now you can be like me I'll be with you even in you till the end all the father hath given me is yours just think of the birthright the benefits The Inheritance the blessings the power the life the discernment the fruits the revelations the understandings all the goodness and grace and mercy it's all there right but you got to pursue it you got to go after it just like Elijah and Elijah he pursued it he went after it here we've got a whole world of the word of God but we've got to come to the place the only way you get there is through instruction you've got to be told how to get there I can preach the gospel but each one of you has a key and a road that you must find each one of you has a door that you must open each one of you have got to come to a place where you're willing to move things out of your life you're willing to apply the token you're willing to get to that spot where you just don't believe it but you finally come in contact with him and you hear his voice that takes a lot of work it takes a lot of effort it's not he easy to hear the voice of God that's why the church world has supplied so many substitutes I'm closing he says it he says and it testified of his righteousness to God he offered a more excess thing the same thing took place with ishma and Isaac one was flesh the other one was Spirit one of them bonds woman the other one free woman it happens the same thing to Israel and the moabs two great churches coming together and when Israel was waiting to go into their promised Place Church spiritual Jacob's People Israel on the road Esau's people meant them the moabites church powerful and the great leaders of the church balum and came down to curse his brother but he found out that he could not curse his brother he failed with the blindness of his eyes to see the predestinated plan and to see the word of God first Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God then the believer hears it recognizes it and acts on it the carnal man will never hear it the sound of it but never hear means to understand look at you're looking at something to see it it is to understand it except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of God don't get being born again mixed up with an emotional experience you're born again when that seed in you that part of you is so hungry for God so hungry to get to God so hungry to make contact with God what did he do what did what did Jacob do he wanted to get to God what did he do he wrestled with them he fought for it he prayed for it he fasted for it he he didn't want to know somebody else's experience that's the trouble with the church we want everybody to have experience God don't have clones he's got Sons and Daughters who have men them they wrestled with them the hunger in their heart drove them to God I've got to hear from you I got to feel you I've got to touch you you've got to speak to me I'm done talking if you don't talk to me today I like that guy I forget his name he plowing the field and finally he got down he said God if you don't give me your spirit you're going to find a bag of bones right here we're not talking about salvation we're talking about who you are what your inheritance is what your Birthright is what it is that God wants to do for you but you got to pursue it you got to wrestle for it you've got to get that blessing you don't care if it gives you a limp you don't care what it is you got got to have it and and you could be fine where you are but there's something in you I want to go higher there's another level and I'm trying to tell you something if I can put it as simply as I can you're not going to do it if you don't pray if you don't apply the token if you don't clean up your life if you don't get along with God if you don't wait on God if you don't hear his voice I'm preaching the gospel that is not a substitute for you and God talking it over yourself God will make it so for you he'll take you to the day you were born and walk you right up through your life he'll put the scrub brush to your mind he'll put the scrub brush to your heart he'll take every burden off of you he'll take every lie that was ever told on you off and you'll sitting there you'll be so free you'll be free you'll be changed you'll be different but what happens when you become dull of hearing you quit pursuing the birthright the birthright has an answer for every circumstance that you're in it's like saying I've got a will or I've got something and you never open it up to find what do I have in my inheritance for this situation that I'm in I am going to go set before the Lord oh let me say that again I am going to go set before the Lord little boys and little girls I am going to sit before the Lord I'm going to wait upon the Lord until he speaks and then when he speaks I Know that heaven and earth will pass away but his word will never pass away I've got it settled I've got it ended it's done for me Faith cometh by hearing and hearing then the believer hears it recognizes and acts upon it and understands it except a man be born again he cannot enter the kingdom of God that's the way it is today they say it's a bunch of Holy Rollers a bunch of people who's this who's that the other but they failed to see it's the following the directions of the word of God what does a Believer do he follows instructions he follows the the directions how many have any directions he follows directions where do you get directions from it's like in the military what do you wait you wait for orders they give you orders and then what do you wait you wait for them whether they're going to change their mind or not and then when they say go you go when they say stop you stop I Fellowship man the other day said I was in Washington DC two years we were on our way to Korea two years we waited to go they tell us to get ready they tell us to stop tell us to get ready they tell us to stop it didn't matter he was in the army the way it is oh you think they got dollar hearing NOP they're soldiers yes sir sir I'm telling you I'm tired of getting ready today I am not going to pack my pack I am not going to clean my gun you've told me this 500 times can you imagine brother Tim your way down the sea someplace in one of those magnetic lines and you say captain I want out well he look at you and says there's the missile tube son you don't get out of this You're Made for This ja can't get away from it do you hear what I'm saying you are made to pursue this world of God's blessings inheritance you're made to do it but if you become dull of hearing that doesn't have an effect on you you're not going to your prayer closet you're not fasting you're not praying you're not asking God to speak to you you're not even pursuing his voice we are not Esau we are not not the church carnal we are the church spiritual we are a church that follows the directions of the Holy Spirit and God's revealed word that's who we are we got to shake ourselves we've got to come to that great place in our lives where we start following directions not what you think he wants you to do but what he directs you to do can you imagine the concert that the Holy Spirit would be playing if each one of us was being directed by his Spirit doing what he told us to do I love it when someone comes said brother McGary I sat down in church and I read that scripture I just listened to that tape that's exactly what's on my heart what is that people that are looking for his voice do you hear me this morning I'm not condemning you I don't even want you to come on condemnation I just want you to quit being dull of hearing pursue it put an effort into it hear his voice he told us how to hear his voice maybe I should have played it after but hear ye him hear ye him you can have all these great quotes and everything but when God quickens a quote to you you ought to bring that before his presence until he brings that quote and shows you where it needs to become alive in your life we've got a bunch of Standalone quotes out here he said this I believe it he said this I believe it but it's not making you different it's not changing the way we think we're not putting it into our lives this word is given to transform you amen from what you are to what he wants you to be and that's your inheritance itance that's your Birthright you can all have it you say what do I do about my past say you're sorry he's faithful and just to forgive you I'm I'm sorry if the service was a little longer this morning but our sister had to testify and I'm glad she did we had to dedicate a baby baby I'm glad she did Sir now we've got to go some say some prayers over a sister that passed away well we're not saying the prayers over her uhuh she may be looking in she may not be but wherever she is she ain't wanting to come back here but the family will be there and some of you I hope are be there and supposedly at 3:00 we'll say a few words and the life goes on but do you want to take another step the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord that's right they're not happen stance happenings they're ordered how are they ordered they went and sat before their commanding officer and they waited on him to give them orders they followed directions they did whatever they needed to do to come into His presence to get those orders and to obtain the birthright and I I just wish I was a greater preacher type preacher to set that simply thing in your heart but if you don't put effort into finding and hearing his voice you'll go your whole life will you lose your salvation no will you get a reward yes but will you get all that he has for you will you have reached your fullest potential I just don't want to be a believer I want to be a son and daughter of God yes sir obedience yes sir is better than sacrifice God bless you let's Stand Together the musicians would come I don't know what time it is it's it's already one oock man forgive me justplay anything sister Glory maybe there is a blood or something let's just take a moment he can you just sit in a moment here and ask his presence to come around you and deal with your heart maybe you say Lord I there's a lot of stuff in my [Music] life and I've tried to get out of it but unless you tell me how I'm going to fail over and over again I need to hear from you Lord I make decisions in my life I go places and I've never talked to you about it just to hope so that it'll work out oh I'm a Believer I can go do whatever I want to do Lord I don't want to be like Esau I want my I I want my relationship to be higher on the tree of Faith than that Lord I want that unction I want that Spirit to speak to me I want that leadership of the Holy Spirit Lord I want you to speak to me in prayer speak to me in the Bible speak to me on tape I want to hear your voice Lord and I'm here this morning I want to lift my hand to you and say Lord I want to hear your voice I'm willing to do whatever it takes help my unbelief bring me higher up Lord I want to be of service for you I want to play the music that you want to play in my life Lord there's so much on my heart that I would like to say but it takes me a lot of words for one teeny thought but you said that Moses was in your presence for one minute and knew more about God in those two minutes than he ever did in all the time of his life Lord if you just give each of us just one minute just one touch on our heart Lord I can undo the things I've done and I'm so sorry for him Lord I'm sorry for all the things I've done and went ahead and Lord I'm sorry that sometimes I let Prosperity take me away from you I don't pray about how I spend your money I don't really consider what comes out of my mouth just rambling to and fro and going to work and almost become now I lay myself to sleep just some little prayer Lord but Lord You're you want more from us and you want to give us more Lord I I don't want to live on a hope so anymore I want to live by your voice and I want to hear your voice and Lord I don't know who has their hand lifted father but I lift my hand and I ask father that you help me that I never become too busy to get alone with you and hear your voice and I trust this morning Father that each person in the sincerity of their heart they realize that there's another world besides the world that this flesh is in there's another world to live by there's another dimension in Realm that's controlled by [Music] God and I'm here asking father that you translate us from the bondage of this world into the freedom of your word world in every hand that's raised in every heart that's bowed heavenly father I ask that you would take the d Ness of hearing from their hearts and let this word sink deep so that each person in here as an individual will act upon it they'll find that roadside they'll find that closet they'll find that place where they sit down and they press in your presence and then relax and hear your voice father speak to us as a pastor I ask it that you would Grant it for me personally and for all the sheep that you have placed into my hands father they're not my sheep they're your sheep and father they love your word and I trust this morning that you'll Quicken this word that we heard to every heart that there would be a greater sincerity and a greater fear of God and a greater understanding that we have Birthright and we want those birth rights more than anything else we ask you to Grant it this morning in
