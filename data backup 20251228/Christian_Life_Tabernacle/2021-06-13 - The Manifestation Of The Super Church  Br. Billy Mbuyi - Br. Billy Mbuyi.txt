songs [Music] [Music] commit the service to the lord invite his presence heavenly father we are so grateful to you for your mercy and goodness to us lord for providing so abundantly for every need for the keeping hand that you have bestowed upon us lord we we couldn't even begin to lords to account for all the ways that you have blessed our lives lord all the benefits that you've given us lord we just thank you for your kindness your faithfulness lord for your guiding hand we thank you for your word lord we just want to be careful to welcome you in this place lord for without you this is just another gathering of man and lord we ask that you would have control of this service do as you would father we pray that your word would have dominion over everything in this place lord we take control of every spirit in this room that it would be under the submission of the word and lord we pray that you would meet each need lord that you'd speak to each one of us lord that you would just walk freely in this place that your will would be done in all things and we committed to you in jesus name amen amen we are uh going to read in psalm 103 this morning it's a very familiar chapter i think to most of us says in verse 2 it says bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits you know and then of course the next several verses begins to lay out all of his benefits it's a five-part benefit plan that is better than any benefit plan you can get from any employer on earth you know for many of us when you go and you work for an employer that employer will provide you with a set of benefits in exchange for your time in exchange for your work in exchange for your commitment well likewise when you commit yourself to the lord he has a benefits plan you know that benefits plan includes in verse 3 a total forgiveness policy a complete healing policy in verse four it includes a full redemption policy with an all-inclusive life insurance policy a hundred percent satisfaction guarantee and an everlasting term renewal in verse 5. i challenge you to find an employer who can give you a benefits plan like that and even when they give you one they will try to consume so much of your time that you'll have no time for the father's business and it turns out that the workload required for this benefit plan is very simple my yoke is easy and my burden is light you know i want to look at just one of those benefits this morning it says in verse 5 who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle i am reminded of the children of israel when they were delivered out of egypt you know while they were in egypt they were completely burdened down with the responsibilities that egypt laid on top of them you know they were led to believe that their very survival and their very comfort were based on the work that they were doing for pharaoh they developed a taste for the diet of egypt but it required their total commitment and there was no rest even though they had good things maybe to eat there was no rest there was no strength they were totally burdened down you know but when god began to perform his deliverance work he took them out from under that employer he began to put them under the coverage of his benefits plan it says in exodus 12 39 you can look it up but basically millions of people very very quickly leaving egypt with nothing more than the leftover bread they had from their night with the lamb they had no time to go and collect any of the food of egypt and they were unable to carry any of that diet with them when they were redeemed all they had was that little unleavened bread from that night with the lamb you know and as we read in exodus 16 he began to change their diet he began to feed them something that came from heaven amen you know he satisfied their mouth with a heavenly food source that sustained them every day of their journey you know and it renewed them to such a point that they never hungered again until they got to the promised land you know jesus was quoting from deuteronomy 8 3 when he was when he was fighting the temptation of the enemy and it says this and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live he satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle here's another well-known scripture isaiah 40 29 he giveth power to the faith and to them that have no might he increaseth strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fail but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint you know we live in such an hour of pressure society you know our employer our school civilization all demands so much of us and it's you know they would have us pour a hundred percent of ourselves into these things you know it's getting so intense that even those among us that are young people are getting exhausted and burned out you know and it's gonna get to such a point that only those that have access to a heavenly food source will have a path to renewing their strength says in second corinthians 4 16 for which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day how many can say that they are participants in this benefits package you know aren't you glad that you have access to a heavenly food source that can renew you every day for the journey in an age that would seek to consume you utterly you know and i'm grateful for this benefits package he satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagle would encourage you to eat of this diet let's read psalm 103 together starting in verse 1 bless the lord o my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name bless the lord o my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and tender mercies who satisfy it thy mouth with good things so that thy youth is renewed like the eagles the lord executed justice and judgment for all that are oppressed he made known his ways unto moses his acts unto the children of israel the lord is merciful and gracious slow to anger and plenteous in mercy he will not always chide neither will he keep his anger forever he hath not dealt with us after our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities for as the heaven is high above the earth so great is his mercy toward them that fear him as far as the east is from the west so far hath he removed our transgressions from us like as a father pity with his children so the lord pitteth them that fear him for he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are dust as for man his days are as grass as a flower of the field so he flourisheth for the wind passeth over it and it is gone and the place thereof shall know it no more but the mercy of the lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him and his righteousness unto children's children to such as keep his covenant and to those that remember his commandments to do them the lord hath prepared his throne in the heavens and his kingdom ruleth over all bless the lord ye his angels that excel in strength that do his commandments hearkening unto the voice of his word bless ye the lord all ye his hosts ye ministers of his that do his pleasure bless the lord all his works in all his places of his dominion bless the lord o my soul [Music] do you know what it is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] uh [Music] is [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music]

when we know that when the word goes forth it brings forth the healing and deliverance and all the things that we have need of in order for us to be better christians we love you we commit everything to you and ask those things in the name of the lord jesus christ we pray amen amen happy to be gathered in the house of god amen let's just open our bibles i want to read the scripture in the book of isaiah a very familiar scripture reading isaiah chapter 7 we're going to read uh start from verse 10 it says moreover isaiah chapter 7 verse 10. it says moreover the lord speak again unto hazards and saying ask thee a sign of the lord thy god ask it either in the depths or in the heights of it as i said i will not ask neither will i tempt the lord and i love the answer from isaiah says and he says hear ye now o house of david is it a small is it a small things for you it is a small things for you to weary man to weary man but will ye weary my god also and in other words letting you know don't be afraid to ask don't don't think you're tempting the lord it's for you weary men yes but for god it's not nothing is impossible to him ask and don't be afraid and it says but will he also reary my god also it says therefore the lord himself shall give you a sign behold the virgin shall conceive and bear his son and he shall be and he shall and and shall call his name emmanuel amen may the lord have the blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated amen i i just for a moment we just uh we'll like to speak this morning on uh we may not be able to get to the full thought of what we're trying to say this morning but i hope the foundation will be laid i want to speak on the manifestation of the super church the manifestation of the super church it says remember we read it said is it it says and he said unto him oh he house of israel it is a small things for you to re to weary man to you weary man but we were also rearing my god therefore the lord himself will give you a sign now where brennan preached a message a wonderful message called the i was listening to i believe it's called the super sign and this is where my inspiration uh just came from and he he begins to describe the time in which we're living in and and he speaks it gives a very description of the time and the circumstances and the things that are surrounding us today and andy and and i he he says something that just strikes my heart and and he mentioned he talks about the pharisees and he says they are able to discern the the signs of the time they're able to look around and in fact in matthew 16 verse 1 through 15 1-5 it says the pharisees also with the sadducee came and tem and tempting desiring him that he would show them a sign from heaven and he answered and said unto them it says when it's evening ye said it shall be fair weather for the sky is red and in the morning it will be foul weather for the today for the sky is red and lowering oh ye hypocrites ye can discern the face of the skies but but cannot discern the signs of the time in other words but running is pushing putting such an emphasis such an uh importance on the need to discerning the signs of the time and that's why i love the one of the things that's so wonderful about you know even the message that we believe in it's not so much some things that if somebody can come and tell you oh you know the the and predict and tell you about things and and things that you you have to figure out how they're gonna happen or you know as you you hear the word but then the interpretation somebody has to come and give you interpretation of what just happened but sometimes the prophet puts it in such a plain language that we can look around and see it says this what i just read is what just happened what i just saw here is exactly what the messenger told us about this what i just read here is exactly what was promised was going to come to have so the time determines what god is about to do the times determine how we should prepare ourselves the time determined what kind of what word has been promised or what the promise for that time is what we're supposed to be doing what work are we supposed to be doing where are we supposed to put our emphasis on because the preparation that we put in depends on the time that we're living in but when i'm often time will say that in this age we couldn't be building boats because that's not the promise of the time it will say that promise of this time we couldn't be go out in the wilderness so try to go across the red sea because that's no promise that's not the promise of the time we couldn't be doing anything else outside because it's not the promise of the time the promise of the time is there is a word that a messenger that god sent in this generation and is bringing people out of the denomination and getting us ready for the rapture it's not complicated it's very simple it's when man injects their own thinking trying to interpret it this way or that way that's when everything falls apart but god's way god's word is very true god's word is very clear god word is very deterministic of what he wants to achieve so the prophet says here and he speaks following the scripture we just read it says now he says god god knowed the end from the beginning therefore he could plan everything that he would that he would that it would work out exactly to his glory and to give ss and that gives us courage to know that no matter what comes and what goes god is making everything the clock is ticking just exactly on time it's giving us an assurance to know it says and i like this even as the scripture we read and isaiah says you we remain he's talking to riri men just to let you know god has this under control god knows the time god knows the season god knows exactly what's happening god has this under control in other and our peace will come only when we take our trust and put it in him and know that he has everything under control that's when we'll have peace if we're still trying to figure it out ourselves we won't have peace if we chill fly to find our answers ourselves we won't have peace but if we bring it to him and know that he knows the season he knows the time he knows the word when we know that he knows all those things it brings peace within ourselves so he continues on and he says it says sometimes we get weary we say upset we get hasty we think oh we we must do this and we must do that but remember god's clock will just be well god clock will will be just exactly on time all things all these things has to be this way has has to be done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge for by foreknowledge he could predestinate not by desire but by foreknowledge and i thought that was such a a a right way to put it god's the scripture says god's desire is for all to be saved it's for the whole world to be saved but by his foreknowledge he knows who will be saved and who won't be saved so he doesn't predestinate by desire he predestinate by four knowledge and with knowledge he can make the proper determination he can come back and say because what he says we know that god doesn't learn anything he can't say one thing and then come and change it he can come in and and say something and say well i've learned better now i'm changing it what he says is what's going to come to pass why because he's an all-knowing god he's the creator of heaven and earth he knows something before it can happen he knows what's going to happen the next second he knows what's going to happen the next minute he knows where you're going to be the next minute he knows where you're going to be tomorrow he knows all things about you therefore with that knowledge it affords him the ability for him to come and plan and predestinate according to his knowledge it says god doesn't predestinate by desire he is not he says he's not willing that any should perish but by foreknowledge he knoweth who could accept it and who could not who would not therefore he cannot make anything work according to how big the time clock is sticking away he could he could he says for he could foretell the end from the beginning and therefore he know he knew that he would that he would live in this that you would live in this day he knew that this will be our day and he planned for this day he has had the plan for every day and and for every day and never has one of his plan ever failed he's always on time now that that why is that important because unless we know what time we are living in unless we know what is expected of us unless we know what is it that god is trying to achieve without the understanding of all of this we're going by our own interpretation by our own mind we're doing things based on our own understanding but we understand that god has never made a man to walk for himself or to try to figure out his own way it's always been in the program of god for god to provide for man every step of the way in fact god made man so man can depend on him god make man so we can come and depend on our heavenly father and use of his attributes and use of himself use of the things that he has his healing and his power his deliverance and all the attribute that he has that we may partake of it but guess what men did invented hospitals men invented a better health care or a better way for him to do this all of that trying to separate themselves from what god's economy was and therefore by knowing the time and the season that we are living in it becomes very important because what we do whatever random says this it says the the preparation the things the action and the choices we're making today is determining where our eternal destination is going to be so therefore by knowing what is expected of you by knowing what the word is for today therefore we are walking into the exp the expectation of god for our final destination if we know we're going in the rapture we prepare today we don't prepare tomorrow if we know the rapture is coming the preparation is done today for us to be there that's why when you know the season it helps you to prepare better when you know the time it helps you to have understanding of of how to to uh to taking uh uh to understand the situation that's happening outside that's why i would say that this morning that the bride of christ or the believers in this end time is not rattled by what's happening outside it's not moved by what governments are doing the church can gather up all they want the world can come together and sing songs all they want that doesn't move the bride at all why because she's not part of the economy of the world she's part of the economy of god and as far as she's concerned she is set and she knows what a final destination is it's those that are caught in the fence that have a problem oh you know i'm not really sure if this message is true therefore you know i'm gonna be one foot in and one foot out just in case those are the ones that are going to perish those are the ones that are not going to make it why because you undecided you can't be caught between two opinions you can't go to the left and try to go to the right you have to make up your mind and sold out and desire to go in a direction you can never be successful in trying to go in two direction at the same time the bride is such a place where in fact the more the scripture is fulfilled the more she can see the condition the more she can see those things happening her heart is rejoicing why because all of those things are only a time piece all of those things are only determining how close she is to living this place now that that's why it becomes why is that important again because if we find ourselves being rattled being moved or being shaken by what's happening out there something is wrong with the state that we are in something is wrong with the relationship that we are in something is wrong with what we are doing because god has given us this perfect word god is giving us the revelation in the end time and those things are here for god to build this perfect church and i want to say this you know the the brother john who was here he he preached about the perfection i'll say this perfection comes by the receiving of a perfect word perfection but random says god will only take what's perfect and the only way we can be perfect is by god himself making you perfect and he's provided his word to make you perfect how he in the end time we've received a revelation even of of justification like we never heard it before the prophet comes and he says when god takes you in by his word when he's cleaned you by the blood of the lamb when he's done all those things you are more perfect even at a baby you are more perfect and it's even as you've never done it before as far as god is concerned it's not in the book who makes that who can make that claim who can take the very sin and dissolves it and bring it back to the very component like a bleach to exactly what it was and when you look at it it doesn't look like it has any trace of sin within it only god can do that what a privileged people we are and he says and why is that because we in the age that we are living in that could never been done in the age before but random says i'm so glad to live in this same time why because the fullness of god everything that we know about god to be everything that we've read about everything that we heard that he done in the past god has condensed himself he's taking all that he's done in the past all that he promised he will do he's combining it and giving it to this generation so so so yeah we are he he speaks of the time and so in this message the super sign but when i'm hits on the element some elements i would like just to bring across uh really quickly just so we can move forward he he speaks he says you know we live in a in the super age he calls it and and i was thinking this message was preaching 63 and i want you to just understand what that means today you know you you we live in the super age it says you know the supermarket and supercars you know super everything you know we we climb we say in texas everything is big in texas oh my i mean it's just there's nothing if you do something that's just average is no longer attractive to just have an average it's no longer attractive it's got to be the super it's got to be the best of the best and you know i remember growing up as a store or a food store it just used to be a closet you know just a closet where you will go and get a couple of things and everything now my goodness you need a you you need a little uh like a moplete or something for you to sit and go to walmart i mean you you can't just to cross from one side to the other you'll be tired by the time you get to the other side there's everything you're looking for why it's the super age a car cannot be just an average car you can't just make a car that goes 60 miles an hour no it's got to be 120 miles in two seconds otherwise nobody won't buy it i i mean that's the time we're living in that's a reality we're living in you know nobody wants just something average everybody just wants super you know they used to be stars now people want superstars you know all you know they stars but then they're superstars so these are about the stars even themselves they're super and everything and that's the world we're living in and now remember what venom says that the natural is only a type of the spiritual what we see in the natural it helps a believer to process what is it that's happening in god's economy what we see happening with the people in the natural a spiritual man looks in the spiritual world and wonder what is it that god hasn't for me [Music] because if we get caught up in the natural and then we stay natural then we fail to reap the benefits of the spiritual but if we see the natural as only a type of the spiritual we can understand where we are at you know the world is uniting so is god you know the church is coming together so is the bride all of those things are only showing how close we are getting and i want to say this we shouldn't be caught up in the natural so much that will miss the picture for the spiritual but let's educate ourselves from the natural let's glean what needs to be learned from the natural and focus ourselves back into the spiritual and find what is god trying to tell me what is god trying to show me where is he trying to take me what is it that he wants to achieve in my life i'll say this god is no longer uh just happy with average also no god is not i'm happy with an average question it says oh yeah you know just go to church and go home just go to church and go home i'll do the best i can no this is not the time for that this is the time where the fullness of god is being dropped into a people where we expect to see a person and when we see the person we see jesus manifested in a human and that takes above average to get to that that takes super to get to that but one of them says you know this is the super day everything is super it says uh the frock lightning in the skies and the cloud nights it says the the certainly declares to us that there will be lightning and uh in the darkness we are aware of it it says and and and and this is what uh what was called super age everything you see now now the days must be super it won't go oh it won't go over if you if you haven't got some if you have if you haven't got something super because it's a super age you have the you they have their age a hat if they have to now they've got to super age everything you see you can't go down the corner store or anymore and find a block of cheese laying like there it says and like it used to be the old corner story says if you go if you ever go to the food if you ever go to the food ever go do everything wants to be classic air conditioned market come to the supermarket you must go and have time to and and even they they they pay more for their food they've got to go to a supermarket that's right because it's super i mean he makes some interesting comment and i probably won't have time to go through it and i thought he says it used to be that the kids walked to school and now they all nobody walks to school everybody takes a bus or gets driven by a car and now in order to add to what's missing because you realize that if you don't walk you're gonna die they spend millions of dollars to build a playground for them to play in so they because if you lack exercise you're going to die so in order to provide for exercise you know it's like you know we i talk with my mic we joke all the time you go to walmart you find the closest parking to the door i mean you if they were permitting people to park at the door you will be there because you don't want to walk to your car you want the closest place possible but yet your body needs exercise and then you go you buy a treadmill and then you oh the same exercise you could have gotten to walk into your car you see how men's thinking is we think otherwise we think differently we we we get caught up into the world and we get caught up into all these things and he speaks about so many things if we're not paying careful attention will be drawn to everything that people are doing oh this is the new thing oh yeah there we go we're gonna go do it oh that's what we do now okay we're gonna go do this you know we want we want we want our houses i tell you when when we lost power it only took a couple of degrees down for everybody to start sweating for everything to start dropping i don't think i could take this i we do we need to go to the hotel or who do we who got power that we need to go to the place and we our natural body itself is telling us that we are hybrid we cannot take more heat we cannot take when it's too cold we we need a lukewarmness we gotta stay look one if you press it to one side it goes bad if you do to the other side that's what the natural tells us oh but i tell you in the spiritual the same thing god is looking to make you a hot believer god is one to put some fire out of you to cause you to do something to cause you to become something not to stay lukewarm not to just come to a place where you know it's it's usually it's when things are taken to an extreme that's when you know what it's made out of but guess what we don't we don't want to be tempted you know when god brings it you know god i can only take it up to here you know we set our own limits and when he wants to go get our break i'll break our break you know we want to set the limits on what god can do for us and you know no he's the master he's the creator of you he knows how much you can take why don't you just take your life put it in his hands whatever happens master i trust you i know you know me better than i know myself i know you have a better plan than i do i know you know the destination that you're taking i know exactly i know you know what you want out of this flesh what do you want out of this body i don't understand but i trust you why is that important that's the seed of abraham that's the royal seed of abraham anything outside of perfect surrender is not the seed of abraham the fleet of abraham is if death is what it takes i'll take death if you need me to kill my son i'll kill him why because he trusted god so much the scripture says that he knew that he had received the son from the dead that if god was to take that son and kill him the same god who provided that same sound was able to raise him up again from the dead that's the gospel of jesus christ so he says he says i think of every woman is getting super dressed model and the age and he says the old-fashioned shoes they had to add some letter in it you buy them three dollars a pair it says the very kind the very best kind had the letter it had the letter letter in them than dozen of the pairs you get today so it takes about 10 shoes to get the same size and quality letter that you used to get before and i was just thinking you know and especially the young people you may have known this you know the couple of weeks a couple of months ago they came up with this shoe they call it the devil's shoe or satan's shoe and and it was only it was a nike it was only they claimed it had the real blood in it like a real human blood or something like that and they only make a couple of thousand pairs and it was sold out sold out you couldn't find it i mean a pair went by a thousand dollars super age i mean you you wonder i did the knowledge of what they're getting into because they call it the satan's shoe everybody wanted it they have what they call the yeezy shoes they're over a thousand bucks it comes out it's always out of stock you wonder who is buying them and if you look at them they're not attractive i'm ju i'm speaking here because it's very important we realize what's happening around us because it's the it's the age we have to know because we have to know because this is very determining of what's happening spiritually it's gone people are just anything that comes out it's gone and people are just whatever this one does the other one wants to do and everything and i want to say this to even our young people sitting here people want to come to the place today men's desire is always to mix the word of god man's desire is how can i go to church on sunday and still go to club on saturday they want a religion that would afford them the ability to be both in heaven and on in hell or on earth the same time they never want anything that will commit them to anything that's the nature of man people want to be i want to be a youtube star i want to follow them but yet i want to be a christian that's not the ground to play with i want to be an instagram star but i want to be a christian i want to be this but i want to be this you cannot mix the two we are not called to play within those groud that's not the ground that we play in our ground is the spiritual reveal word of the hour and we only have one motive and one destination and that's out of this world i like what brother mike said you know it wasn't even thinking about it but as he began to say just get caught up in the corporate world and see how much of your time i i have people i work for they they take the clothes to the dry cleaner they bring them food to eat they go do the old change for the car you think that's that's awesome well i wish they could do that for me that person is on the phone 24 7. they can't do anything they are stuck there phone call meeting after meeting after meeting why the commitment of what they signed up for and that's what the devil wants to do just suck you back in suck you back in and i want to say that kind of lifestyle will not take you to this destination that we're talking about that kind of lifestyle will not get you in heaven the lifestyle that will get you in heaven is one who's committed to the word of god you do what you need to do for work but your focus is in the things of god i'm eating of the word i'm eating of the word because remember what i'm adam says that you become the word as you eat the word remember we bypass the theophany and the way we're going back to the word is by eating the word and he says and all these signs and all this marks the spiritual darkness all these things we see happen in these super super super he says if we only know it says we are in a hurry we've got to get to get there he says when we get and and what we do when we get there he used to take and walk home from work he used to it which i just talked about it about the kids taking the bus he continues on and he says he says and you know his people and you know his people god's people of the bride has always been warned of god to watch for the signs of the time he says jesus when he was on earth he said to the pharisees he says in his day he says you blind pharisees and says you go out in the evening and you go and you look in the skies and the clears clear and the red and you says tomorrow you said it will be clear day and it says then you go out they are lowering and hang and angry looking and then tomorrow will be foul weather he says he says you can discern the face of the skies but the signs of the time you can discern if you would only know me he says you would have known my day and if you knowed moses he says you would have known me because moses wrote of me and this this is where the word becomes a personal a personal calling we we it seems like we see the same things but people process it differently it seems like we we see this trigger event but the question we have to ask ourselves what is it triggered in my heart when i see it when i see it what is it in my heart you know a pastor made a comment the other day it's so amazing when you see all of this fulfillment you would think the church will be filled up with people just coming and on their knees and say oh god your word is coming to pass oh god your word is coming to pass but yet the opposite is happening yet people are still in the same conditions that we're in now i'll say this you don't blame the people and i want to even go as far as saying to to to us that god has given us the ability to see it becomes very important that we live the kind of lifestyle that proves what we have received because oftentimes you know you you hear a lot of people because we receive a revelation because god has opened your eyes to see it it doesn't you don't get an exemption to the fruits of the spirit because the scripture tells us that to him much is given much is required so to us that have received this word the more we have to live a life that's showing the things that we have received to to when when people have because people have to have questions how come you see this and this is the kind of life you live in you have to come to the place where your life is your testimony your life speaks louder than your words your life speaks louder than anything you can say when we get to that place that's when we have the real message to the people that's when we are really speaking a gospel to the world that's why we really become salty that's when we really become effective because what i it's not what i say it's where i live we can't blame them because none of us can open somebody's eyes no one came to you and beat the head at your head and say look look look look until you saw it no if you saw it it's because the heavenly father the your father the creator of heaven and earth gave you the ability for you to see and i want to say this if he gave you the ability to see walk in the revelation that he has given you don't walk in somebody else's revelation don't do it until you see it too because if you open your eyes to this he will be able to open your eyes to the other thing oftentimes we get in conflict with one another you don't see this how come you really don't see this well the only reason why you see it is because god allowed you to see it why don't you pray for me for the same god who showed you to help me see it also i think that's when will become more effective now remember i'm speaking about the super church what is the super church but one of them says when god comes down and descends into a man and become a man that becomes a superman [Applause] not one man has educated himself not when you've come up and said you've heard of no when god the creator of heaven and earth when his holy spirit descends upon you and take hold of you you become a superman it says and now we just find out about and now we find out just about the same thing exists today it says when we know we are living in the hour of gross darkness it's covering the earth and the people and we find out that all these things the modern achievement the super rage and so forth we are living in is only a sign of gross darkness in spiritual realms we are in laodicean church age where we are just lukewarm they could go to church the people could go people does and seem to have a zeal to go to church but but but to know anything about the spiritual the time that they are living in some of them are as blind as could be about those things no matter what god would do and how well it will do to prove by his word still they just can't see it says and i wonder if it is just about like what it is what he said they have eyes but they can't see and he says we are to look around and see all these things what's happening are signs at the end in the end because these are the things that was predicted to be at that time and then he says and then he says he sign he signs always for run his event his sons he the signs that he sends will always run before the event just as that just as it does it says what you see when you see the geese go and the the the the bugs come out and you see leaves falling and and and count and and continued nature uh branding god's law of nature blames in and then he says he for runs his event he's always been it's never failed and he will never fail and listen to this it says and if we just follow to continue if we just follow the contin continuity of god's word we will never fail you so our success is in following in the continuity of god's word he talks about the season he says when we see the tree buds and everything we know that's that it's springtime and we know summer is next when you see the leaves falling and all those things you know winter is next so every season that comes you can look at the time and be able to predict what's coming on next so there has to be a time we can look around and see what's happening and know what's happening next this world is up to no good this world is coming to an end you you you can look at everything that's running around and see that this cannot continue on the way it's going it cannot sustain itself it's going to come down to a collapse but it's in that time that we have to come to a place and realize that what is god doing for me what is it that's happening within me what is god wanting to achieve i want to say this god is not looking for slaves that's not what the scripture says in fact the scripture says that in the end time that nature itself is groaning for the manifestations of sons and daughters now remember the same scripture also says a son when he's young is not different from a slave and what's the difference between a slave and a son a slave only following a slave only follow instructions oh that's what we're going to do the master wants us to do this this is what but we find out that god has taken us and as sons as we grow is brought us into a new relationship where we can come to the father and in this end time the father has revealed to us the motive and objective of everything that he's been doing christ the mystery of god revealed what did i have in my mind in the beginning what is it that i'm trying to achieve today what is it that i'm trying to do today and in bringing you in that relationship is bringing you to a place where you become coequal with him where you become a son where you know why you're doing what you're doing where you know what you're supposed to do where you know that you're supposed to be led by spirit to do the works that he wants you to do that's why he says in the church book it says the harmony that exists between the father and the son it says that same harmony has to exist between christ and this bride or god in this church why because she says nothing except what he tells it to say she knows the mind of she has the mind of god those are the description of the age that we are living in in the spiritual we know the things that god wants to do let me just say this the things that god is trying to achieve are not completed yet are we together here the things that god is trying to achieve are not completed yet it takes you and i to get into the program to bring them to a finish line god is looking for people that he's created for this age so when we say the super church is the church that god himself is dwelling that he himself can work up his plan inside of them now how can he work up his plan inside of us when all we caught up is god i didn't have money for bills today god i don't have this today i'm sick today and everything about what you're talking about god has to do with the natural and the things that you desire so is it that god's plan was that it would only supply in the spiritual so that you work for him in the spiritual but in the natural you go back to the other side and you try to do it for yourself so god's plan was not completed when he calls he calls barbara says when god makes you a christian he makes you a full christian when god calls you to be a preacher he makes you a fool in other words he supplies both natural and spiritual whatever need you have you go to him but your desire has to be that father i want to find myself doing your work and how do you use me to do your work and wherever i find myself i'll do your work if our focus is divided then we can't have the perfect result if our focus is broken up then we have to find for this and find for that but when our focus is single to him he knows how to take care of the rest it says oh god if only the world if only the world could only see that see what that god and men are one that now remember the super church is exactly this god and man are one the super sign was the first man that god could come into and all that god was he poured into christ that was the first superman and let me just stop this before i go on i don't want to forget this i was thinking about in the old testament it's so amazing you know and we said it you probably we've heard it preached over and over but but but the branham description when he gives the description of david and and samson and and and people he never actually talked about anything good about their physical nothing i never heard him say well he was big and he had you know the cc boys and i mean oh my goodness i mean you would i mean you would think about a skinny guy i mean it's like what like 50 60 pounder you take the description and and the thing that blew the people minds away was because they will look at the person and look at what they did they couldn't put it together i'm talking about god superman they would look at the person and look at him and say this person can never do this i don't believe it until i see it myself it will come and they will come and they'll try everything and find out can you find out where is his strength this this is not this defies the natural law of strength this person cannot do the works that they are doing they looked at jesus and the same thing they said it says this person does not have no beauty to be desired but the same scripture says when he spoke they said what kind of manisters that even the wings and the waves will obey him my brother my sister the superman at the end time you that are sitting here you're not going to be any different in fact but says remember the man that came to abraham had dust on his feet he looked like he just walked a long distance he looked tired possibly prospered perspiring and when he got to abraham he needed water and he sat there and he ate off the food human food but who was that that was god oh great it's a mystery of godliness the mystery of godliness is the end time is a people just like you with the weaknesses with everything with all the natural things that bothers you but yet god can come within the vessel and do something according to his words it's not people that walk around that they look like they're holy all the time no it's it's people that work it's people that you know they try to do certain things and the barbara says jesus prayed for the sick he was tired and he went and sit on the rock he had a headache it's tired he says i i need some water right now god in the human flesh and that's the superman when he got into that flesh that flesh didn't do what the flesh pleased the flesh did only to produce the works of god that flesh was only focused to produce the things that god desire and i want to say us lastly this morning if we can only come together and be focused on one objective don't worry about the world you will save it if there are elects in the world it's the life that we're living that would call them out if there are those that needs to be called out it's all works that will bring them out god working through us bringing them out but our sole focus is what is he that you want me to do but says let me continue all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church and that is what calls through the superchurch he says he called he says in the church super sign god and men together that was to be the super sign the super sign was to be god and men together god back into the church manifesting as human flesh god uniting with men his sure super sign it says notice the eternal sign now he's giving you what the eternal sign is the infallible sign it will never fail it says man and it says the word and man become one and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us that's the super sign now and oh if that was the super sign of that day when that same spirit that was in jesus christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today that is still the super sign we need that word to be manifested remember banham says when god spoke it if it didn't come to pass it says it was not light the only time the word became light is when it was in the human flesh it's only when he took flesh and was manifested and the promise for now the super church is that god will come and dwell in the flesh let me just read this in skipping so so i can get to the end here but random says in the church edge it says here is what i'm trying to say to you the law of reproduction in each species brings it forth of its own kind according to genesis 1 11. and it says and god god said let me let the earth bring forth grass and the herb healing seed and the fruits yielding fruits and the fruits healing you fruit tree yielding fruits of his own kind whose fruits is in itself upon the earth and it was so it says and whatever whatever life that was in the seed came forth into the plant and ants into the fruit and then it says the very same law applies to the church today whatever the seed started the church will will come forth will come will come forth and be like the original seed that beca the original seed because it's the same seed in other words the seed that was planted becomes the very seed at the end same thing and then he says in these last days the true church bride the christ seed will become the headstone and she will be the super church and that's where i got my title from she will be the super church and i when you go if you listen to this message but when i'm is adamantly letting you know this is not something in the future this is today this is now this is what's happening with us it will be the super church a super race she it says as she nears him as she nears him they in the bride will be so much like him is that the direction we're moving in there will be so much like him that there will be even there will even be in his image let me just say this that as we near him as we come closer to him we will be in his image we will be so much like him that will be in his image the image is what bears the resemblance of somebody like if i was not here and they project a picture of me it's an image of me it's something that shows how i look like how i act or how i move and all those things so the image is is the resemblance it's what put the characteristics of something that could be identified when you look at the image of something it tells you for you to recognize what that thing is so is the scripture says now one of the things that challenge that we run into in this end time is we know buddha says speaks about john the baptist it says when he came he came in fact he talks about he says the kind of job that he was supposed to do you don't learn by education you don't learn by theology he had to be taught by god himself so he went in the wilderness so when he came and he was presenting this was a word of god that was spoken by isaiah he said behold the virgin shall conceive and isaiah spoke it and we see that word comes forth we see the word of god come to pass in other words god speaks it and then we see it come to pass we see mary comes to display when the word comes the word itself produces the elements of who's supposed to produce the word and we see also when god came and he spoke when when john the baptist came he was able to point them back and say look this is what was prophesy this is what the interpretation of what isaiah said was this is everything that was spoken we are seeing it today on the day of pentecost but random says when peter stood up he was able to take the scripture in troll and says that this is what joel spoke that you are seeing today what you're saying today in other words calls the messenger the prophet he says is a it's the chief sign that has to be on the scene before anything can happen remember before the promised son can come to abraham god came in the human flesh amen before the royal seat could come before the world city came and then the world seed came so the manifestation of the chief's side when you see the chief sign you know that the promise of god for that is true when you hear from the chief's time you know the word of god is not going to fail when you heard from the chief sign you might as well consider it done as far as god is concerned that word is fulfilled and i want to say this it's not different from this generation when we come here and we see a messenger stand before what troubles people is the fact that when it comes and it says that christ is coming people are looking for another vessel to say oh where is he where is he where is he oh but it's the same chief's time when he stand there and says whatever he tells you follow it that's no longer a man speaking when he says i don't know what he told you when he says he turns his back that's not a man turning his back that's melchizedek standing there and turning his back [Applause] both the fulfillment and the announcement is in the same flesh what is a god manifesting himself and my brother my sister that is to show you that it's sitting here that's the same manifestation cannot stop in the prophet that same manifestation has to be in the bride's member did we see it or did we not see it if we didn't see it we're going to be waiting for a long time you have to have an image or representation of what you're trying to be like you have to understand that's why the trinity doctrines it becomes just an idolatry there's no connections at all how can this god who's three which one is going to come and dwell in me is it the father is it the son is it the holy ghost but oh if you can come to an understanding that it's only one god and he promised in the last day it will take off his spirit not another spirit his spirit then poured it down from the people that they will all have a measure of his spirit why to manifest him him was one into a body of people [Applause] his image that's the super church he continues on and says this is the order to be united with them there will be one there will be the very manifestation of the word of the living god denomination cannot produce this it says wrong seed they will produce the creeds and the dogma the mixed up words this mongolization brings forth hybrid product it says the first son adam was the spoken word seed of god he was given the right to reproduce himself that is why the bride was given to him he would produce to reproduce himself to reproduce another son of god but she failed she failed by hibernation she caused him to die the second son jesus also a spoken seed word of god was given a bride like as was adam but before he before he could get to mary before he could get to marry her she had fallen she like adam's wife was put to the test whether she would believe the word of god or live or doubt the word of god and die she doubted she left the word she died from a little group of a true seed of of of the word god will present christ with a beloved bride she is a virgin of his word she is a virgin because she knows no man no creed no dogma by and through the member of the bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of god to be made manifest in the virgin the word of the word of promise comes to the virgin mary but that word the word of promise was he himself to be man manifested god was manifest he himself acted in acted at that time and fulfilled his own word of promise in the virgin mary he was an angel that had brought to her the message but the angel the angel's message was the word of god isaiah 9 and 6. he fulfilled at that time all that was written of him because she accepted his word to her the members of the bride will love him and they will have his potentials for he is their head and all the power belongs to him they are subject to him as a member of of of of the bodies are subject to the head and i want to say this we are coming into the union we are coming into the manifestation where christ the head is manifesting himself in the bride and i trust that we're doing every thing we can we're eating off the word we're continuing in the revelation of what is showing us so we can fulfill our part of the prophecy a believer in this end time can never be satisfied with just an average i want to be that super church and whatever it takes i say god bring it on me i heard of that super church and i'm a member of it and there's something within me that's calling for me to be part of it because remember he says that the bride in the same time will not fail it says e fall but this bride will not fail for one reason why she's the word she's the word and if we are the word let's manifest the word let the word it's not as manufacturing and now it's a hymn working through us if the desire within your heart he looks at it and because the scripture says you draw near to me i'll journey on to you the more we want him the more we desire it the more he say do you think we have more desire than god does you think we want god more than he wants us oh i tell you that that your desire is only a little peace it's only a sliver of what he wants to push out for you we couldn't even contain all that here let's stand if the musician could come uh he says now there's a super sign of the holy spirit we know we absolutely know that christ still lives and reigns he is the super one he says you talk about the superman the devil has something to counterfeit the very things that god has made everything that the devil has got he says he makes it off of something that's original the devil cannot create now you know that and if the devil is a creator then we've got two creators the devil cannot create he perverts what what what has been created it says it says now look what is adultery adultery is a right act perverted what is lie lie is the truth perverted what is sin unrighteousness is righteousness perverted anything that the devil is devil has got is something perverted from god that god what god originally made that's the reason that they would say they will call jesus beelzebub the old foretailors devil out of out there that was perverted the spirit of the prophet it says and that's the same thing today they don't understand it but if they would only read the bible the bible said it's a super sign i think we've been given all that we need in order for us to advance into the super church the word has been revealed god is walking with us i believe we need to eat of the word i need to indeed to become one with the word i think we need to get to a place where we desire more of him than more of the things of the world we need to die to ourselves this nature was not made to inherit the kingdom but we know there's a nature within us i want to inherit of the kingdom of god and when we build the inner man by the desires and the things that we have i believe god is going to come and step into it god is going to lead us and he's going to guide us it's going to bring us into the fullness that we need to be where we can say lord i'm here i'm at your service whatever you desire i'm here wherever you want me to go send me i'm here for at your place let's just say not tonight this morning oh this is my desires [Music] oh [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh
