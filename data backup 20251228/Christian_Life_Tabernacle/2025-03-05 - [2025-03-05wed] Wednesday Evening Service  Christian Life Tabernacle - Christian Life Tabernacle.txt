own doing it's God in you God in us and he told Moses if I can find it here he said I I appeared unto Abraham unto Isaac and unto Jacob by the name of God Almighty but by my name Jehovah HOV I was not

feel knowing that we sit under the voice of the messenger of this age though the systems of the world don't see how that fits in the word of God they don't see how it's a part of the Gospel they just never moved as they set up camps down life's road but father you have shed your light upon us in this hour for it shall be light in the evening time lord and you gave us eyesa that we might see and our eyes were open to the truth of your word father and we saw you veiled in flesh doing the same Works amongst the Gentiles that you did amongst the Jews and father our hearts caught it and something within us said amen and amen father may we draw our confidence this evening from that word we ask you to bless us tonight as we've come out to Fellowship around God's word so just trust father that you'll open it up to to us we pray in Jesus precious name amen amen if you have your Bibles we want to read a couple scriptures and and trust that the Lord uh will just encourage us this evening um I'd like to read uh uh let's start first in Galatians um uh five and uh we'll just start with 15 because it's getting to be very acal in these recent times Galatians 5:5 he says but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another this I say then walk in the the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to the other so that you cannot do the things that ye would but if you be led of the spirit ye are not under the law and then let's turn over to Romans and um and we'll start in Romans uh the 10th chapter and we'll start uh with uh uh Romans 7 and uh let me see where I want to start here let's we'll start with uh let's start with uh Romans 10 and 13 He says for whosoever sh shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher amen aren't you glad God sent a prophet and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring Good Tidings of good good things but they have not all obeyed the gospel for isaas saith Lord who hath believed our report and I want to just hold that up here who has believed the report of the preacher and we're not talking about this preacher we're talking about the preacher of the age okay every other preacher should be just under the preacher of the age and have the same voice you know what I mean and they they should be preaching that gospel you know not Wesley's gospel but the truth of the light of the gospel for that age and but then we've got to believe the report so let's just let's hold that so then Faith cometh by by hearing and hearing by the word of God faith right Revelation faith hope that of something to believe that you know will come to pass that comes by hearing the word of God that's the source of it you can't muster it up inside yourself because you have no you have nothing but yourself to back it you know what I mean but if God put in his word I could lift 500 lb you know the only guy I ever knew that bench 500 lbs was brother Chris but uh so if you could do that God said in his word I could do it then I could do it because God would be there to bring that word to pass but if I just muster it up right then I don't have anything within me to bring it to pass so Faith cometh by hearing and then hearing by the word that spoke it so just hold that there because we're going to go through a little something tonight I just think it'll lift your spirits and um and and and just make you just feel so glad for the faith that cometh By Hearing in hearing by the word of God but I say have they not heard verily sound went into all the Earth and their words unto the ends of the world Amen so what we want to do tonight is we just are going to sit back for a moment and we're going to listen to uh a portion of uh out of the message God's power to transform and uh and if you it's just 10 minutes but if you just follow it down you'll be able to start placing to what's transpiring and like I've always said one of the things that Satan has uh tried to do is he's always tried to lie to us and the prophet of God brings that up but you have a choice right to believe what God says or to believe what he says okay and and it it it comes down to a pretty simple thing but so uh you may have your seats and uh uh if you want to uh I guess you can pull it up on your phone if you want uh uh this is uh 911 um 1965 and uh we're going to start on paragraph uh uh I believe we're going to start on uh what was it paragraph uh uh 212 was that correct okay paragraph 210 all right so we're going to start on paragraph 210 and we're just going to go into about paragraph the end of 239 and then we'll just want to go back uh through it with us and just read some of the paragraphs together and uh just see if uh our faith can be lifted up and I I trust in this tonight that you can see the love of God for you so God bless you let's just take a few moments and listen to God's wonderful word see it's a modern Eden now what done himself he's moving himself Rome this final great eating eating place you see what the pope come over here the other day you know what all them 13s that happened then he spoke 13 words had 13 taking communion spoke uh in Yankee Stadium which is 13 everything was 13 and our nation's numberers 13 prayers the 13th chapter of Revelation 13 stripes 13 stars 13 bars 133 numbers on the coins 13 stars on the everything's 13 and a woman here comes the pulpe the head to the woman the false Antichrist to the false bride of science which our world our America Eastern World here Western world has led the world in science comes to her in his scientific church I think is that the God's power to transform 91165 then we then we'll have to line up the paragraphs I think there's several of them do you have my book there really let let's make sure yeah so but the prophet can speak thus sayith the Lord there he is nonsense I like thus sayith the Lord but the prophet can speak thus sayith the Lord people say nonsense see there's not a hope for them it's they say well we're smart we're ual we don't have to take that kind of stuff we know what we're talking about it's also an old proverb that fools will walk with hob nail shoes Where Angels Fear to tr certainly now what is the transformation quickly how do we get it what does a transformation God does it by the spirit of his word he transformed he plants his seed throws his Spirit on it and brings forth the product his holy spirit trans forms a seed word in to be Vindicated of its kind what kind of a seed you are that shows just what's in you you can't hide it whatever you are inside it shows outside you just can't keep from it you can't make that tree anything but what it is see it's it's going to be that way the Holy Spirit transforms the seeds that's on the inside of it no matter what kind of seed it is it'll transform it it's evil it'll bring forth evil if it's a hypocrite it'll bring forth a hypocrite if it's a genuine word of God it'll bring forth a genuine son or daughter of God through a thinking man's filter when the seed comes up he comes through that it produces a son and daughter of God one day when the world lay in the darkness of chaos God now listen close course we're not going to speak just a little bit longer look one day when the world was again in all kinds of religions washing hands pots wearing different robes and bonnets and so forth it lay in the midst of another chaos the genuine Israel of God had been so perverted from the laws and statutes of God Jesus said you with your Traditions make the word of God of no effect to the People by your tradition look at them holy priests they call them and Jesus said you of your father the devil and his works you do it's exactly what he said now when the world lay in that kind of a fix God's spirit moved again upon a seed that was predestinated he translated and transformed Isaiah 9:6 of its promise the God was made in human flesh to save that chaos time when man was made the image of God here comes God by the prophet foreing now remember the word the prophet foresaw it just the same Prophet that seen Satan in this last days of this educational program and things he had religious program the same prophet Isaiah 9:6 said unto us a child is born through us the son is given and his name Shall be Called counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and of his Reign there will be no end and that word's God's word and the spirit moved upon that word and it formed in the womb of a virgin amen a son is born I created born Satan tried and triy again to spread he took him up and said if you are what you say you are then do some of this healing here for me show me how you can do it turn this bread in this stones into bread I see you take a dive because the scripture says you'll do it you see them religious Devils today still saying that same thing if there's such a thing as Divine Healing here Ladi brother SW so let's see healing that same devil stood at Jesus cross said if thou be the Son of God come down off the cross the word said he was the Son of God the spirit proved he was the son of God Isaiah 9 and6 was fulfilled the other night many of you in the broadcast heard how that we 60 some odd scriptures almost I believe about proving that the scriptures said that that was him oh Satan tried and tried again do everything one night laying on the back of a ship he see him asleep he said I'll destroy him right now but he couldn't he tried to tempt him into doing the wrong thing but he couldn't do it why he had been sprayed with a repellent of predestination it can't be deceived no the word said he'd be here amen amen ain't no devil going to bother him no other Son of God is predestinated to take his place he's sprayed with a repellent Satan's poison denominational doctors don't even touch him at all he moves right on nothing going to bother him it didn't have any effect upon him well I'll make you the bishop of all the earth I have rule over it if you just worship me come on join my group I I'll make you the ruler I'll step down let you up he said get sit behind me Satan it is written thou shall worship God the word and him only shall thou serve then one day on this great person I'd like to stay there a while but one day the spirit moved upon him again because there some word have been wrote about him come from God to the prophet and he was led to the slaughter like a lamb and the spirit moved upon on him and led him and sent him to calvary's cross there he died and everything that was spoke of him in his death was fulfilled to bring light and Life to all the predestinated seed of God that was up on the earth he brought the way to do it here is the seed the the spirit brings the life transforming Sons and Daughters of God from the world in this dark chaos into to be Sons and Daughters of God don't stumble that word predestination I know you do but listen it's not my word it's one of God's words if you want to read it read Ephesians 15 which he has predestinated us to the adoptions of sons through Jesus Christ just let me break it just a minute and just a minute to break this out of your mind look just as you were in your father at the beginning of germ seed do you know that every one of you you were in and your great great great grandfather also do you know that read the book of Hebrews or that we find that Levi paid ties when he was in The Lawns of Abraham four generations behind him when Abraham paid TI to Mel chdc it was accounted to his great great grandson down below him and he was then in the laws of Abraham there you are see you were in the laws of your father but your father could not have any fellowship with you until you was transformed into a body of Flesh my son there was in me I I I wanted a son but he was in me then see he was in me then but through wedlock he was transformed into a man like me and then he become like me you become like your parents see because it was in you to begin with now if we are the sons of God his attributes which you are an attribute of your father not your mother your father The Germ lays in the father and now your mother was an incubator that bear you bear the seed of your father see and the Earth in flesh is also the incubator that bears the seed of God see just exactly not the world how great the world how great the god that made it Hallelujah now if you are a son and daughter of God then you were in God at the beginning you're his attribute if you wasn't there then then you never was or never will be cuse I cannot bear a from my loins the son of this man here or that man there I can only bear my own son sons and they bear my likeness Hallelujah is it Sons and Daughters was in God at the beginning now look you got eternal life you save we believe it that we got eternal life well there's only one form of eternal life and that's God hallelujah that's the only thing it is eternal is God then if you've got eternal life that life is in you always was and you were in the laes of God before the even was a world and when the word itself Jesus himself is called the word and St John 1 said in the beginning was the word and the word is with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell among us then you were in the laes of Jesus and went to Calvary with him you died with him and you're raised with him and today we're sitting in heavenly place that's in him fill with his Spirit Sons and Daughters of God die with him raised with him sure now then now now you can fellowship with him you couldn't back there because you were just a word in a seed but now he's manifested you and now he wants you to fellowship with him then he came down and was made blessed so he could perfectly fellowship with you amen see the perfect Fellowship oh my them deep mysteries of God how wonderful see God cannot Fellowship in the spirit so God became man with us Jesus Christ was God himself manifested CS his the son because he was begotten but it's just a tabernacle from to live in no man has seen God at any but the only begotten of the father has the clarity God built himself a house a body to live in come down so that you could touch him 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy great the mystery of God is for God was manifested in the flesh see the Angels believed on received up into heaven see now he you being flesh and him being flesh then you can Fellowship one because he was God's attribute of love God is love is that right and Jesus was God's attribute of love and when the attribute of love was displayed which that was God himself all the attributes that hung on to him come to him all the father has given me will come to me short Hadad be predestinated it wasn't you won't be there that's all certainly now we can Fellowship us through the The Riches of his word and which you are part of you are part of the word because he was the word at the beginning you're the word now see I'm preaching tonight or Sunday one of the days when I get in about what the word is see and now you are part of the word listen there's one thing I can't do I can't brag on my ancestors no I've come through an awful mess my father was an Irishman my mother was Indian squa half Indian her mother was the Indian dra pension now all of them drunks most of them died with their shoes on fighting gunfighters and so forth I can't brag on nothing about that cuz my ancestors and my family the trees is terrible but brother there's one thing I can brag on all right I can brag on my Lord Jesus who has redeemed me and with his transforming power planted his seed by predestination and I saw it who son am I now I can brag on him and I've spent 33 years of my life bragging on him he spare me another 33 years I'll try to brag more on him I can brag on my ancestors Hallelujah Hallelujah ye that redeemed me and planted the seed of life in here let me look down upon this word sent down his spirit and said here it is speak this to that do that and oh my I can brag on him how did you do it through the washing of the Water by the word the Waters of Separation wish should you explain it true predestinated believers will stay with the word because they are part of that word oh wondering Stars how long will you wonder you Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Outsiders whatever you might be wandering stars from church to church from pillar to place and television to television world to World why don't you come on he belongs to have fellowship with you he's longing for you he wants to transform you by the renewing of your mind not to the church or to the denomination but to his word which you are a part if that desire is in you blessed are they that do hunger and thirst for Rises for they shall be filled and is s his transforming power to bring you out of this deformity of religion that you're in in this deformity chaos that we're in God has sent his transforming power his word Vindicated proven to bring you out of this religious deformity of ignorance that you're walking in naked blind miserable and don't know it think of it friends you know God sent his transforming power to fulfill his word and changed the whole body of Sarah and Abraham transformed an old man and an old woman because he promised he'd do it and what God promises to do that he'll do there's nothing anything any perverted thing God can't do nothing with it but he will keep his word and he'll send his spirit I the Lord have planted it how water day and night L some should pluck it from my hand the Bible says that oh wondering Stars you with the desire in your heart you've got to have it or you wouldn't be sitting here this morning and you wouldn't be in those churches and auditoriums and things you're in out across the land if something didn't bring you in there some person spoke to you don't go any further there's a washing of the Water by the word that'll make you white is snow oh sons of God listen don't stay in that deformity come out of it Abraham believe God and call anything contrary you say how would I make my living how would I do this that's God's business how would my associates to turn me down God said he that will forsake his own father mother wife husband homes houses I'll give him homes and houses I'll give them fathers and mothers and brothers and sisters and in this world and eternal life in the world to come it's a promise friend that all that's got to be watered every promise God makes comes to pass every seed of God is a promise and sisters stop bobbing that hair because it's an uncommon thing before God quit wearing those clothes it's an Abomination to him you Brothers you men stop cater to these denominations and do into things and let your wives do such things it's Unbecoming to Christian come back to the word take that word it'll grow it's got to grow God's transforming power that brought it up in the first place he's just on his road back taking it back again now he's going right back again to where it was Enoch was translated from Death By God's transforming power what did God do that for for a type of the Rapture in church that's coming yeah Elijah was a saint Jesus body was quickened after it was dead and in the grave Jesus body was quickened by the word of God and transformed from a dead cold image to a resurrected glorified Son of God because the prophet Psalms 16:10 if you want to put it down 16:10 said I will not leave his soul in Hell neither will I suffer my Holy One to see corruption oh God that word has to come come to pass it's God's word plant it in your heart if you want to go on Rapture you want to be Christians genuine place this word as a I believe it was Ezekiel God said take that scroll and eat it up that the prophet and the word would become the same every promise in there has to manifest itself because it's God's original seed don't you let some educated Theologian out here try to pump it out of you don't you let him spray with that carnal science and knowledge and education believe God he didn't say I had to understand it he just said I had to believe it amen amen let's just take just a couple seconds and just uh run back over just a few of those statements again and and I mean you you heard some things you know and the the the the people he was preaching them to just did not believe it and you notice how he said the prophet says thus sayith the Lord ah they don't believe it they're smarter than that he was giving a precursor to the very attitude that was going to be there of the things he was about to say you understand now because the church had made its living and binding the People by the fact that if the they would follow their teachings and follow their instructions and adhere to their rules that they would be saved and have eternal life so they that's what that they uh were holding the People by and now he's going to start saying things that breaks down everything that they're built on and so uh if we we just went back he says now what is transformation quickly this is paragraph 212 how do we get it now what does the transformation okay how do we get it we don't get it you understand that this is you know Jesus said you didn't seek me I sought you you know no man cometh unto the father l i draw him okay so he's trying to eliminate from your mind that that there's some form of of actions that you have to take to transform yourself okay that's what he's trying to do but he's trying to get us to is to believe what he said Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word believe the word believe what the word says and then he's going to just move so so what's going to cause that to come to life what's going to cause the change so if you just follow this I just I want to share this with you because I really believed that we're we're he said it right at the end we're into that now the Rapture is coming now that trans it's now so I believe that now is now so he says God does it by the spirit of his word he does the transforming by the spirit of his word he transforms he plant his seed throws his Spirit on it and it brings forth the product his holy spirit transforms the the the seed word in to be Vindicated of its kind okay so you understand that the seeds planted he knows it's there but now he's going to transform it he's going to throw the spirit Spirit of his word not what everybody thinks as an anointing you understand or as a rain okay if we divide this you will see how the rain can fall on the just and the unjust okay it's not the rain it's the seed right that's the part of you that's God right so he said he says now what kind of seed you are that shows just what's in you now that's why I read that scripture the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these two are contrary to the other your flesh is not what's in you the seed is in your flesh and he went on to explain that about the seed being in the womb of the Earth you were in the womb of your mother he's trying to get the idea out of you to quit looking at yourself here and look at what the word says you are and where that you were in the beginning because that's what that he wants you to identify with see what you you he already said we read it right if you had eternal life you've always had eternal life so you're not being saved from no having no eternal life to eternal life you're being saved from the LIE do you understand that if you don't get this flesh to be become perfect you don't have it but what he's trying to get you to understand is if you'll hear this word this word will transform you it'll change you you from flesh to life and that's what he wants you to have faith in because without it's impossible to please God Satan wants you to look in the mirror and say no but you want to look in the mirror and look yourself right in the eye and say Satan get behind me cuz the spirit spirit of God Can Transform now let's just read a little further if you don't mind just we'll just spend a little time of Fellowship brother Jeremy Shriner is going to preach for us this weekend so uh we just want to Fellowship here he says what kind of seed just what what's in you you can't hide it whatever you are inside it shows outside you just can't keep from it you can't make that tree anything but what it is see it's going to be that way now listen the Holy Spirit transforms the seed that's on the inside of it the Holy Spirit transforms the seed that's on the inside of it no matter what kind of seed it is it'll transform it if it's evil it'll bring forth evil if it's a hypocrite it'll bring forth the hypocrite if it's genuine word of God it'll bring forth genuine Sons and Daughters of God through a thinking man's filter when the seed comes up it comes through that it produces the Son and Daughter of God now so we always think well what what's going to the word of God the spirit of the word of God is the same Spirit of the word of God that makes you a Believer is the Same Spirit of the word of God that makes the evil seed evil that's why the rain can fall on the just and and the unjust it's not the it it's not the rain that transforms you it's the spirit of the word and you heard him say right every word is a promise so and God cannot lie so if God says anything it'll come to pass so no matter what struggle you're going through no matter how bad the flesh Wars against the spirit you've just got ask yourself do I believe what he said about me and if you can believe that and you can call unto the Lord who who will call unto him that hasn't heard and hasn't received the report the report for our age was that God predestinated the seed in you before the foundation of the beginning of the world and no regardless of what your ancestry is he planted it he'll water it he'll bring it to pass and that's the LIE is no he won't look at me I better get this to a place he can do it just believe God Abraham believed God he tried to give his wife away I mean what a crumb bum but he still believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness his righteousness didn't come from the bringing the flesh into subjection his walk righteousness came to believe that God could transform his flesh into the word of God he can do it for you he can do it for me see The Same Spirit Satan's not a Creator The Same Spirit God brings forth the evil and the good just look look what's in you what's in your heart what's in your desire what do you want the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh they're contrary one to another so we wouldn't always do the things that we would want to do but we're not looking to do it right we want him to do it we want him to create the change and we keep trying to change ourselves into this model of Christianity we keep trying to change oursel into this idea of Christianity instead of saying wait a minute God can't lie right and if I'm his attribute he said where else could my son come from but from me so if I'm his attribute then I've got to come forth and the life is in the sea we just went through that so it's there and the spirit is going to move upon it and it's going to change you that's why I've been trying to preach in just as humble as way as I know how is that you've got to recognize that you can't it's not becoming a Christian setting yourself in stone and have having all these Christian things that you do and you're just hanging on for dear life hoping he comes no it's changing every day transforming you bringing you growing you enlightening you teaching you your world changes around you it's not oh I believe I it's not believing it's knowing that he will transform you he will change you let's just read quickly some beautiful things he said so he says it's a product son and daughter of God that's what he produces and then he goes right down he says in all the darkness and all the chaos what is they do washing of pans all kinds of rules all kinds of things what were they doing with religion they were making the word of God of none effect they the people weren't looking for the change they weren't looking for a spirit to mold them make them to renew them to wash their water of their mind to change their thinking you know how beautiful it is to have your total thinking changed if you've ever been in this walk very long and you look back on the way you used to think you'll just bury your head in the sand but what's happened your mind is Switched look at some of you are under bondage to things that the people just held you down and and and uh just you know you're all rigid and and you had to do this and if you did this and you did that and all this stuff oo you're in danger no you're not if you had eternal life you always had eternal life that thus sayith the Lord prophet of God said it and I believe every word he says not not taking nothing from you but what did Paul say he said they come in and they spy out the Liberty the freedom that we have they want you to think if I could every little thing just perfect no I can't make it perfect I want to make it perfect Lord transform me change me he doesn't do it all at once so we read d says they make the word of God of no effect and so you know and and so they and he just keeps on going here and he says everything he said in Isaiah come to pass and then he made this statement Satan tried and tries again to spray it he took them up paragraph 16 says if if you are what you say you are he ever use that that on you if you are what you say you are and he always tries to play the hypocrite card the flesh card God didn't say what I was when I was here he said what I was when I was there so I'm not going to let him defeat me with my myself I'm going to look at myself and say okay what you're seeing he will change what you're seeing he will transform the weakness that I'm expressing he will deliver me from because he said in his word but what he wants you to do is become paralyzed right there with his lie and the only thing that sets you free from a lie is the truth the truth is what set you free and that's why they hated him because here are the prophets preaching a word that's going to set the true Sons and Daughters of God free from all their denominational nonsense free Not Afraid how can you how can someone make you afraid if you believe this man's report if you believe his report he says he says if you are say what you are then do something of this healing here for me show me how you can do it he he never changes his tactics turn this bread stones into bread let me see you take a dive because the scriptures said you'll do it see he does the same thing to you he's always comparing your flesh to your Christianity he's always comparing your weakness you can't get rid of your weakness you can't you can't heal yourself that's not our promise how do we overcome we overcome by the word of God we overcome by the promise of God we overcome by the fact wait a minute if that seeds in me then his spirit will transform it and I'm going to change from what you're seeing into what he wants to be so when you see yourself in weakness and you see yourself in failure and you see yourself in sin you hang on to the transforming power of God that God can take you from that condition and make you from what you are to what he wants you to be but you've got to be ready to change or transform and then he keep he he goes on he says Satan tried and tried again to do everything and you know he but he couldn't do it and he tried to tempt him he couldn't do it he had what did he have the repellent of look listen what he said he tried to tempt him to doing the wrong thing but he couldn't do it why he had been sprayed with the repellent of of predestination it can't be deceived no no the word said he would be here amen it it would deceive the what very elect if it was possible when we start drawing the line between that Eternal part that we are and this outside manifestation and understand that our eternal life is not what's at stake we're not fighting for eternal life we have eternal life what we're fighting for is the transformation of this flesh into the image of his son by his spirit that we start bringing this under subjection our hearts changed our minds changed our hungers are changed our desires are changed our Nature's being transformed it it's not instant that was another part of the LIE come down here kneel down speak in tongues rise up now you're saved wait a minute I'm going to read you in a second he said you always were saved you weren't saved you're still under the a lie but you always had eternal life think of it do you believe that can you believe that about yourself why did Jesus have perfect Faith because he believed what the word of God said about them when you can come to that place and say I love this message I love this word My Flesh fights against me but now I'm going to come into fellowship with that part of me that's God that part of me that's always was God it's there it's in me he said it's in me now I'm going to have him take that part of me that's him and overcome this part of me that's in the world he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world and then you got a clear picture say will make you your own enemy yeah your flesh is not what you are but we don't sin that the grace of God May abound right but we go back to what our heart's desire is and we overcome because it's given to the Overcomer that that lets God transform him to get the victory and then we just go on so he says he how he tried to tempt him and and he goes on he says Satan PO he said there ain't no evil going to bother him and no other Son of God that's predestinated to take his place what how do we take his place we don't don't take his place but we take the same place that he is with the same guy trying to spray us right he is sprayed with a repellent Satan poisons denominations old doctors don't even touch him at all he moves right along nothing's going to bother him see it didn't have any effect on them and I like that see we move right right along we keep moving right along we're not going to stop he said and and then he make this statement everything that was spoken of him in his death was fulfilled bringing light and Life to all the predestinated seed of God that was upon the Earth he brought the Wake to do it here is the seed the spirit brings the life transforming Sons and Daughters of God from the world in this dark chaos into being the Sons and Daughters of God that's how it donees don't get destroy yourself because you're in dark chaos take hope that this power of the Resurrection is going to transform you from whatever weakness you're in to Victory and he says don't stumble at the word predestination let's just go down and read a few more things because like your parents see CU you was it was in you to begin with and if you are a son of God his attribute which you are an attribute of of your father not your mother your father The Germ lays in your father see and now your mother was an incubator that bear you but the seed was in your father and the Earth is flesh is also an incubator that bears the seeds of God see exactly not the world how great the world is it's how great the god that made it is is see now listen to this you've got to Anchor I've got to anchor on this I'm just trying to encourage myself the scripture says encourage yourself in the Lord right now if you're a son and daughter of God then you were in God at the beginning right your his attribute if you wasn't there then then you'll never was or never will be why try to make your way in there settle the question I believe the word I believe what I heard he said I was in him now I look in the mirror there's no evidence of that because it's just Earth but I'm going to take that word I'm going to eat the book I'm going to take the promises I'm going to accept everything that he says and it's going to start changing me and transforming me from Darkness to light he's going to move on me but if you get your mind keeping looking at yourself and looking at your failers and working you'll work yourself to death what do you do when you do something wrong ABA father I'm sorry and he throws it in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remember no more but don't worry you say you're going to be judged in your present condition my present condition was in him before the foundation of the beginning of the world because it's a promise he said it I didn't he knew what his thoughts of us were and so he just comes down he just keeps he just keeps uh just going Sons and Daughters of God at the beginning you've got eternal life you say we believe it that we got eternal life well there's only one form of eternal life and that's God that's the only thing that is eternal is God then if you've got eternal life that life that's in you always was and you were in the loins of God before there even was a world where's your Victory your Victory is in that statement Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God when I can approach the Satan when I can approach my life when I can approach my shortcomings saying wait a minute I have eternal life he who is in me is greater than he who is in the world I can win this challenge I can defeat this devil I can overcome this because of what and who that he said that I am if you're still looking at yourself where were you when the Sons and Daughters of God shouted for Joy now you're starting to see the secrets the secrets to loving one another the secrets to uh being be able to forgive one another because you understand wait a minute God's not going to leave one of these seeds ungrown he's going to harvest every single one of them it could be your Baptist brother it could be your Methodist person it could be it doesn't matter to you because you know none of that's all that is just a lie but you know that that Eternal Word of God will come to pass we'll just close with with some of these great things he said if you got it well and when the word itself Jesus himself is called the word in St John he said in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the words was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us then you were in his loins of Jesus and you went to Calvary with them you died with him you raised with him and today we're sitting in Heavenly places in him filled with his Spirit Sons and Daughters of God died with him raised with him sure and now you can actually take that statement and throw yourself in the total negativity when were we there you we've got to go back to our Eternal self and realize that we're not of this world we're in this world we came down in this fleshly body and we're going to overcome this flesh Body by his transforming power and then we there just we you know we're just and then he goes oh my the Deep mysteries of God in paragraph 237 you being flesh and him being flesh then you can have Fellowship one with another because he was God's attributes of love God is love is that right and Jesus was God's attribute of love and when the attribute of love was displayed which was God himself all the attributes that hung unto him come to him all the father hath given me will come to me all the attributes that hung to him will come to him can you imagine if we could start approaching life tomorrow morning get out of bed and say I'm an attribute of God I have eternal life God gave it to me and I'm here to be transformed I'm here to overcome I'm here to bring this flesh into subjection by his grace by his Mercy by his power by his life Satan he's going to defeat you he's got he's he he has me in the palm of his hand and nothing can pluck me out and you you'll quit beating yourself and when you have a weakness you won't beat yourself over it you'll go to him and see the word of God come to pass because he'll transform you from what you are to what he wants to be and you'll see the light and the transforming of go power of God just grow and grow in your life and and he says and with his transforming power planted by a seed by predestination and I saw it who whose son am I now that was in paragraph 240 but brother there's only one thing I can brag on I can brag on my Lord Jesus Christ who has redeemed me and with his transforming power planted a seed by predestination and I saw it did you see the message right who son am I now then whose son am I I now I saw this so quit the battle quit being halted between two opinions quit dragging yourself down make a stand this day who are you who are you and and and draw on the Eternal transforming power of predestination to give you the victory over everything in your life because he wants to make you V Victorious True predestinate Believers will stay with the word of God because they're a part of the word he is longing for you he wants to transform you by the renew in of your mind not to the church or to the denomination but to his word which you are a part of if the desire is in you he's longing for you he wants to transform you oh Church isn't that that I I I'm I'm getting happy I can't I can't do it's not it's not complicated he said it I believe it that's it he's going to do it I heard it I believe it I accept it he's going to do it he has sent his transforming power to bring you out of this deformity of religion that you're in he has sent his transforming power to bring you out of the deformity and Chaos that you're in Lord I'm in chaos my flesh is against me my spirit's against me my mind's against me I can't seem to get things right I fail I've got all these fleshly desires I have all these things that's working oh you've sent your transforming power to bring me out of this chaos bring me out Lord trans transform me change me make the change in me it's not believing something that gets you there he gets you there by changing you and he's going to change you right into a Rapture amen I I love it you know God sent his transforming power to fulfill his word and change the whole body of Sarah and Abraham and we could just go on and and he then he begs us to come back to the word uh uh that's what we are he says he says that word has to come to pass it's God's word planted it in your heart if you want to go into the Rapture if you want to be a Christian genuine part of his word as I believe as Ezekiel God said take the scroll and eat it up and the prophet and the said the word would become the same and every promise in there has to manifest itself because it's God's original seed don't let education theology out here try to pump it out of you don't let him spray you with that carnal science of knowledge and education believe God can you believe what God said that if you have eternal life you always had eternal life you were always there you know how different that makes you how how absolute what Fountain of every ever lasting power you have to change things if you're faithful and little you'll be faithful in much if we can start changing it's no telling what he can bring our hearts and our minds to to see the Miracles that God can do for them that believe on him amen God bless you let's stand oh my God's word so good amen I I I need a little prayer request if you could pray with me so as as you know uh mom passed away and we're trying to sell her house well uh we went out there and we found a buyer and we wrote up all the deal and everything set ready to go and now we lost the we lost the trust well we can't find the documents that say that we are who we are so nobody we can't prove that the house is ours we can't prove that we can sell it we can't we can't you know say here it is you know this is who's supposed to sign so you know it's kind of like the book being sealed up you know what I mean so we need the Lord to help us find th those papers um anyway so I won't even begin to think of all the internal struggle I'm having over those papers not being found but anyway it just we but God can God can knows where they are do you believe that amen so we just trust that he makes a way and is merciful and that uh we can put this all behind us and see which way that God wants to take us so we certainly love the Lord let's bow our hearts and the Lord as brother Billy comes to lead us in a closing prayer and worship our heavenly father we heard it as plain as could be plain tonight about where we were and Who We Are and the power that that carries to change us from the chaos that we're in and I believe the Cry of your spirit to every believer is who wants to enter in to the trans formation who wants to become a part of it he's not transforming a church as a group though we come together to hear the word of God and fellowship one another and pray one for another and help one another's burdens that's the love of God shed abroad in our heart by the Holy Spirit we know it's not the rain because the Same Spirit brings the good seed and brings the evil seed but Lord we look deep on the inside and we say Lord I want to be a part of the transformation that's transpiring right now you said it was going on now Lord You're making the change that seed's coming to maturity it's coming to harvest Lord and I want to just I don't want it to be in my mind I want it to come in and take over my whole body my whole flesh my whole Spirit my whole soul and I wanted to start working changes in my thinking changes in my heart changes in my spirit I just want to move up to that rapturing condition Lord I want to enter in and I believe that that just your spirit's been leading us this way and we hearing the voice of your Prophet Lord I just hope it settles into the heart so that every believer here can say I believe what God said about me I don't see evidence of it in my flesh all the time but my spirit Bears witness because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word and I heard the word and Faith brings every promise to pass I ask that you bless it to the people tonight in jesus' name we pray amen amen God bless you pray for me uh uh that uh I I'm you know you probably can tell that I've been just fighting the Flesh and going through a lot some health things but I got a God that Victorious of
