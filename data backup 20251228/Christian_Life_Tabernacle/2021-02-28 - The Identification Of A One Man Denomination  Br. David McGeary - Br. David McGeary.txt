========================================

sometimes god will allow you to go through your present condition because it's better for your eternal end [Music] and that's what he's interested in he's interested in spending eternity with him he's not interested in you being dissolved in fire and done away with his heart's desire is that that he can spend eternity so he only honors what he provides and so as we look at this we say that they hewed for themselves cisterns and so what a cistern is it's something that's man-made and its purpose is is to catch water and there's all types of of cisterns but a cistern has a a specific uh characteristic about it and that's and so we know that a cistern represents a denomination something that's man-made and that's why we said this morning that we're saying it's a man-made uh denomination or a man-made sister or what is the characteristics of somebody that makes themselves and that that's what so as we look at that and we look at it it says they hewed out for themselves cistern and and what is the sister and type of it's a type of something that's man made it and and it's made to catch water which is a type of the spirit and so now we realize that the the the cistern it can't hold water and it holds no water so you know it's a man-made catch all right so it catches the spirit it's just like uh you know songs with an anointing on it and we have a lot of music nowadays and a lot of groups that are out there and and their songs they've got an anointed beat and and and they sing the praises to the lord and you listening to them and and it seems they've created an anointing and it seems to catch the spirit well the music's going on but it can't hold it it's just a man-made catch and and so it's just something that picks up the spirit and and it's man-made maybe sometimes you want to feel anointing or you want to feel something and you put on a certain song or you put on a certain group you know whether it's the hillslide singers or whatever that you you want you want to call it you know maybe it's some other uh a group you know what i mean like alpha and no omega it can all these different things that are out there that causes like an anointing and like something that's kind of uplifting but it don't last it's just a catch you know it's like talk shows and tv shows and and they they they sit there and they talk about god and what god's doing and and and they got all these ideas they're throwing out there and all this stuff they they put out there and a person just sits back eats it up wow wow they're stimulating your mind they're they're stimulating your thought they're you know they're begging for your money and they get you to think wow if i give i'm closer to god and it's just a catch and so that's what we're saying uh you talk about uh maybe some big emotional workup you know just get you that emotion get get it worked up and and you know tears coming down the eye i went to see some gospel music one time i i wasn't really a fan of going to gospel music but i thought i'll go to this gospel show and i got there and the the lady was there and and she was singing her song and she had a little hanky you know like this and and everything and she started talking about fixing her mama's hair you know when she she was gonna bury her oh just cry oh man i got the feeling my heart i just was feeling so sorry for her yeah she had to fix her mama's hair before she buried her and then everything and she said the lord put this heart on my my songs for mama i said oh mama and my heart was just bleeding and she started singing about that and everything and i i just felt like this got caught up in the spirit of it and everything and and i thought oh this is wonderful well then i had some friends come into town and i thought well they might enjoy this so i go out the second night and they sing this song and all of a sudden she says oh i i fixed my mama's hair i said what you just told that story last night you mean that was fake i'm not saying it was fake that cheap but remember but it was an emotional workup it was designed to catch the spirit it was a man-made catch something that that that wouldn't last i thought if that was genuine it would have stuck but no okay it just goes there it just caught me up it it catches you up and that's what they do big emotional workups big big anointings that that people come on with that emotion and that anointing and that style and everything and it catches it but that's not the evidence of what's really of god or not it doesn't hold any water it's a temporary catch and that's what we're asking ourselves this identification that the prophet of god's giving of his sister he says this is what a cistern does this is what a man-made catch does this is something that catches the water but it's man-made and that's what they did they departed from him to catch something that was man-made it's like programs and systems and rituals i've had the opportunity of course i was raised a catholic so i know what it was like to sit into the catholic church and go through the mass and feel the weight of that ritual and that organ plan i've been to a methodist service and a baptist service when that preacher comes to that point where he starts to make that altar call and he brings you can just feel that presence of that call of that ritual that that takes place but all those things are man-made catches they catch the spirit for a little season just for a time but but they can't hold it it leaks out so now as we talk about you know a one man or the evidence of a one-person denomination so we're saying is a is a cistern so if the denomination is made up of people then all those individuals in that system have that spirit they may not want to have it and god provides a way out of it but if the characteristics that apply to the denominations apply to us and then we can see the same characteristics that they have then we might say hey i might be one myself like if chickenpox is little bumps and itches and a rash and everything that goes on it you see all the symptoms of it and then you sit there and they say well i got bumps i've got rash i've got fever i've got every single thing that's identified here it's happening in me might it be that you have pox too so might it be if we can look at these characteristics and we can see what transpires and what's evidence why god hated what they did he said be a hoard of it in other words listen to what he says he says uh he says be astonished oh heavens at this and be horribly afraid be very desolate saith the lord so in other words he's saying don't take it lightly don't take this lightly consider it look at what they've done they've made gods that aren't gods tell me that ain't the truth today we got tv gods we've got singer gods and movie star gods and car gods and everything make things gods that aren't god and they've taken their glory and they've changed their glory for that which doth not profit he says for this be fearful shake yourselves don't don't let this don't miss this understand what's transpiring here that that the the cistern is something that only catches something that's man-made so let's look at it it says they they catch a spirit but it leaks out so what is a cistern a cistern is something man-made but it'll get empty it'll have water when it rains and what does water represent water represents revival that's what it is but a cistern it'll get empty and a cistern can't fill itself it's not reliable so that's one thing so if you find in your life that you just get empty that that you've got to rely on a revival you've got to rely on something that that come by some sort of thing to help catch the spirit then then you sit back and you say oh my look at me if i if i'm empty and he says now a denomination it gets empty it just gets so formal it just gets so touched to a place that it becomes it becomes total totally empty because it's something that's man-made and something that's man-made can't hold god's water so a cistern will get empty the cistern cannot fill itself it's not reliable you can't rely on it you can't put all you just can't put all your trust in it amen you know a song might anoint you one time and you really might take comfort from it but after you heard it 50 times then all of a sudden you don't like the beat no more you don't like the song in fact you need a new song you need a new group you need something else to move you it's not reliable the emotion you'll find out that you you might listen and you might talk and you might find out and this is a type of a denomination and we're finding it now in the hour that we're living people have been in these denominations so long they've listened to the same thing for so long they're hungry it doesn't satisfy him anymore they're they're looking for a real drink they're not looking for another man-made cistern they're not looking for a cistern with a different name on it they're looking for something that's genuine and that's what man's done is they've left the fountain of the living water they've left the what god's provided and they went and provided something for themselves and they're finding out it's not reliable and it can't fill itself it needs something else to renew it and if it needs a revival it needs a rain to come something to work it up some something to create an atmosphere that that they can do it but i hope to think that we wouldn't get to the place that we'd have to have meetings and and people in all the time to pump us up and to work us up if look at yourself if that's the way another if you can't go on your own and you're always getting emptied out and you're always just feeling that that there's no god around and you need some catch and that could be a preacher a certain ministry a certain preacher that rings your belt like i said it could be certain music it could be certain conversation but but we'll get into the other but so there's there's certain things about uh about a cistern that are are so uh identified in and so that's what we say it's not revival you can't count on it it to remain the same it's always changing then that's what happens it's always changing if it's not full the same all the time it's got different water in it it's got different color water in it it just changes so there's characteristics about something that's man-made and we can apply these characteristics and now what we're doing this morning we're examining ourselves by god's word to find out am i just catching the spirit without having it so the you know so it identifies of some man-made thing it's a type of denomination large are one person it has the same identities and another thing about a a cistern or something that's man-made is that the water just stands there you understand like if you've just come up all the time in your life to the same spiritual level you're at the same place it just seems like you come to this spot and you're there for a while and then it leaks out you just get empty okay and then maybe when you start to see that you might think well there there's something more i might not have something here that's as genuine as i want it to be i might have something here that's not really satisfying me and that's what it does it just gets stagnant and you know that's what happened to israel they just got the manna they just didn't want it no more just stagnant and it just sits it's always the same it just sits there he says he says after a few days you let the water stand there and it becomes stagnant you let the water stand in a cistern it becomes stagnant you can put that on the board if you can paragraph 39. can you find that i don't know if they can i know we had it technology broken sister and paragraph 39. he says in a few days you let the water stand there and it becomes stagnant you let the water stand in a cistern it becomes stagnated it gets full of frogs and lizards and snakes and we used to call it wiggle tails little bitty i don't know whether they're not a parasite there i cannot i don't know what to call them but some little thing gets in the water what we called it wiggle tails you know what it is how many knows what i'm talking about why sure all you country folks know you get it all full of stagnant and them that loves stagnation comes with it it actually comes because it's stagnated and it because it's stagnated it draws the animals there that like stagnant things think of it so what happens it draws people you know if you get stagnant religion people can be around you snakes can come around you and frogs can come around you and lizards can because they're attracted to somebody that's not stagnant if your religion just gets to a place where they're comfortable with it and they can deal with it you know they know you're going to be the same they know you're not going to go any farther they know you're not going to get any harder oh that lizard can handle that that snake can handle that because that's what it draws they're attracted to a a a a man-made something they find identity in it it doesn't convict them that all stagnant water don't convict the snake they don't convict the lizard it don't convict any of them it's happy the paragraph 40 will keep going so it attracts those things so you can look at ourselves what does our denomination track what comes in well i'll tell you what living water attracts it attracts somebody that's thirsty [Music] blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled that's what the living water attracts it attracts people that are thirsty but that old stagnant water they kind of like the taste of that he says that's a whole lot like our churches today think i think that we have left one of our greatest sins that the church has done today just like israel it left him the fountain of living water and has hewed to themselves out man-made cisterns and it becomes a habitation of everything that loves that kind of water lizards frogs all kinds of unclean germs live in it because it's man-made tank and in this tank these things stay a perfect example of our denominations today so like i said is it a a one-man denomination or or or uh whether it's not what what happens is is that what happens everything washes into a cistern everything it flows off of everything that's dirty it flows off of the barnyard it flows from the water it just in other words it catches everything it's just it's just uh a filthy thing so we can see that denominations and the denominational man-made catch that catch a little bit of the spirit here a little bit of the spirit there but everything comes into it everything's there uh everything just kind of washes into it and i might just get out of my uh context just a little bit but he says here in paragraph 48 he says now i'm linking that denominations i'm linking that to these dirty filthy cisterns he is the fountain of life he is the living water um a man leave that and dig for themselves cisterns which can only catch filth that's the only thing it can catch and that's what denomination does it catches everything that comes along and wants to join that's what that's what it does it catches every doctrine that comes along every spirit that comes along every anointing that comes along everything that comes along every new idea every new thrill every new annoying it just catches it anything that wants to come along they catch it it's just what it does they're willing to take it in if it's got some money or can dress in a certain way no matter who they are or where they come from they take them in anyhow now they asked brother branham they said now see brother brown why do you strike at those things those people so hard why why is he striking against this so hard click just look if we go to uh up there in paragraph 41 and we'll just talk about it this morning he says why do you strike at it so hard he says it ought to be struck at flee it because it will finally form the mark of the beast remember that is the truth it will be the mark of the beast the nominations will lead right to it it's on the road right now to force by a power so in other words whether it's a one-person denomination somebody that's catching everything because someone that that gets empty all the time that everything leaks out the spirit leaks out it's man-made whether it's the whole group big or small it leads to the mark of the beast right he said paragraph 42 look in the old roman empire that's exactly what led them to the mark of apostasy you found out that no man could buy or sell without the mark of the beast he had he had to have it he's talking about rome natural rome right he says there's only two classes of people who will be on earth so now there's only going to be two classes of people here on earth remember he said be astonished be amazed be desolate be desperate that's what happened when something becomes stagnant just another gospel i i've heard this before there's no new nothing new to it there's only two classes of people beyond the earth those with the seal of god and those with the mark of the beast only two classes you'll have to have one or the other it will be an apostasy a mark of religion apostate religion you know what apostate means religion without god that's what it'll be it's a spirit it's an apostate religion they they they force it on people by society by social teaching by education they they they force and they preach a luke warm worldly mixed filthy everything washed into it everything joined in it in fact if you preach separation if you speak separation from homosexuality if you preach separation from adultery if you beat separation from alcoholism and sin and everything they mark you you know how bad it's getting they're what they're trying to teach young teenagers to take hormone shots to slow up puberty so they won't develop into a man or a woman and tell that they can pick pick sick you know that because that's the greatest sin of being prejudiced and and this all this racism and things can the potter say to the pot say to the potter why has you made me thus god made me an irishman praise god thank you lord for making me at all god's children aren't ashamed of how they're made they're thankful they're a burning light they're on fire for god thank you lord thank you lord amen but what are they doing they're forcing it on us feeding it down our throat every day that's why you've got to shut off all these other voices and hear the voice of god he says listen paragraph 44 it's going to have a image unto the beast as we studied we find out that rome was it always will be or the beast exactly there is no other way to get to it anything else but rome rome is the beast the mark of the beast is the mark of romanism what do you think all the nations are they're daughters of rome same system same nickelodeon leadership nobody drinking from the fountain they drink from their man-made sister whether it's baptists they drink that baptist water it's stagnated if it's been the same thing it may bring you to the realization and the revelation that you need to repent from your sins and you're a sinner and i thank god for it i love listening to billy graham preach i told you how because those people because they're on the other side but i'll tell you once you get saved you've got to have more than salvation hey man you got to have a drink you got to have more god you got to know things you want to fellowship with them amen it's greater it's rome what did what did rome do was converted from pagan rome unto papal rome an organized system a universal system that forced everybody to that one religion or be put to death that's what it did isn't it strange thing that this united states appears on the scene it's like a lamb and the lamb has two small horns civil and ecclesiastical rights civil rights is one of its horns ecclesiastical rights is another one of his horns in other words you can't preach against this you can't preach against that you can't say these things it's forcing something let's just read ecclesiastical rights and after a while when that was a lamb we found out that it spoke like a dragon and it exercised all the power of the dragon had before it and the bible tells us that and says let us make an image unto the beast an image unto rome they had caesar they now the denominational systems has a bicker of christ look what it's going it's an image of something like something else what can we see and we can see it right now in that of apostolic condition the church is forming the world council of churches now it's not a council like everybody sitting at the table counsel is it's all preaching the same thing it all has the same approach it all has the same attitude this luke warm uh no standing for any righteousness no standing for any everybody's saved you're all fine you're all good whether you're a one denomination or whether you're a great big denomination it forces your mind into accepting and believing a religion that's got no life accepting salvation without the spirit of christ to quicken you people believe they're saved by this lying counsel counsel means someone that gives advice somebody that teaches something that set an example that oh you can just go in with your hair all bobbed off and your earrings on your dress up to here and a wiener wiener-type dress and all these v-cut stuff and no shoulders and you can look everywhere you want with all kinds of sex appeal and praise god nice to have you today it catches everything everything that comes in every spirit that comes in no matter where it's from but it is it's it's it's it's here the prophet of god said it was here we just read it the world council of churches which is the image to the power of rome it's an image it's daughters to the power of rome what was the power of wrong what power did they take that was such obnoxious to god taking and the forgiveness of sins praying to saints giving out penance for sins and collecting money for it there's only one who forgives sins there's only one mediator between god and man and that's the man jesus christ world council churches which is the image and the power of rome and will force upon the people the same thing that pagan rome did or papal rome did there is no other way no other thing but that is the truth and that's why i'm striking it in my age in my time because it's got to be struck at that calling that coming in to it's got to be struck at that coming into come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of her sins now i'm putting it this morning as an individual call come out of that condition come out of that denominational condition come out of that cistern quit drinking that cistern water that's full of all kinds of worldlyism i remember i heard a song one time i really liked that song the words of it kind of identified with me so i thought i'd go see the artist oh my goodness i thought lucifer wrote this thing but we don't want to stand for anything what look at this spirit this world council of churches this ecumenical movement we're all brothers you've got somebody that believes the pope is sitting in a throne as the vicar of christ that the body this little host is the literal body the literal blood that the priest is the one that forgives sins the priest has the power to forgive sins and that you can say a few hail marys and a few glory bees and that's what washes your sins away and then somebody that professes that nobody comes to the father but by me that confesses that there's only one person that saves you and how can those two spirits join together in a council or an ecumenical movement thinking that they're going to bring christ to all the world they're not bringing christ they're bringing the mark of the beast they're putting them as slaves that's real slavery real slavery is the slavery of sin amen they asked brother branham about it he said he said god allowed that that move to bring those people to this country so that they could receive the gospel that they can receive the baptism of the holy spirit that they can have eternal life once you've got eternal life this life don't mean nothing to you a lot of people have had hardships it's a sickness of sin but oh hallelujah he says he says and that's why i'm striking at it did i did i finish form the world council of churches paper room it's nothing but it's rome so so what happens it you you you take on the uh uh you you take on the uh romanism is what it is it's a type of denomination it's just that's exactly what it is if some some time we have our our own little ideas and our own little doctrines we make up our own you know if you ever want to filter yourself filter yourself through god's word so that's what it's doing and so he he said because it leads to the mark of the beast the mark of rome think of it as the mark of rome in other words if it's not the true word of god it's catholic i don't care what blasphemous name you put on it it's still birthed by the system you got time for a little bit of bible study if we go late this morning if you have to go just get up and go if you if you want to be baptized another day i understand let's just finish reading this now i'm linking that to these dirty filthy sisters he is the fountain of life he is the living water and a man that leaves that and did for themselves cisterns which can only catch the filth that's the only thing it can catch that's what denominationalism does it catches everything that comes along and wants to join they're willing to take it in if it's got some money or it can dress a certain way no matter who they are where they come from they take it in anyhow paragraph 49 now we find again that this mark of the beast was formed here america is number 13 it was born with 13 colonies it had a flag that had 13 stars 13 stripes and it even appears in revelations the 13th chapter and america has always been a woman represented in our coins even the indian head on a penny it's a woman's profile we know that we know the history of it everything is liberty bell everything else the liberty the statue of liberty everything's a woman a woman number 13. now it's a beautiful thing for us to see those things let's turn to revelations 13. if you get tired then like i said uh just say brother mcgary we're done or i'm done or whatever or please get done america america rose up out of the ocean right out of the sea you know that revelations 13 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and seven horns and upon his horns was ten crowns and upon his head was the names of blasphemy when you know those names right baptist methodist perpetrator and the beast which i saw was like a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as a mouth of a lion and a dragon give him his power and his seat and great authority there's that rome again and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wounds were healed and all the world wondered after the beast and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshipped the beast saying who is likened unto the beast who is able to make war with it now who's the beast it's rome satan was smote at calvary but he shook that wound off right and he continued and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies trinitarian doctrine saints and the power was given unto him to continue forty in two months and he opened his mouth and blasphemed against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle in them that dwelt in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints didn't he do that he slaughtered them and overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations there's your dark ages right okay but he was wounded and then and let's just read up here and it says and all that dwelt on the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man hath ear let him hear he that leadeth unto captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword hallelujah amen what is the word of god it's sharper than a two-edged sword church we can't sit around dumb you understand there's biblical prophecy coming to pass every day the book of revelations is the revelations of jesus christ and these are the things our prophet brought up to us in the seals and in the church ages he says he must be killed with the sword here is is the patience and the faith of the saints in the word of god listen and i beheld another beast come up out of the earth and had had two horns like a lamb and it spake as a dragon and it exercised all the power of the first beast before him and caused the earth in them which dwelt therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wounds was healed what did it do luther come up and and and and struck it right look at the two the horse riders the horse rider started out first the white right and then and then a a a red and then a black the whole world went into darkness the seed went into the ground why because that that beast rome was going to prevail and all of a sudden what comes up luther comes up amen it strikes a wound cleo let come out of it but what happened that spirit prevailed and it denominated it denominated them it gobbled them up and sucked them into the same system god sent out a beat a a beast to speak against it he sent out a lion and then he he sent out an ox which was a spirit that allowed him to be martyred and to be to slain when he ward against the saints there was a spirit on the saints protecting them amen we're talking about what happens if you've got something that's man-made your own mind-made message ideas your own little man-made things if you're a one-man denomination you end up with the mark of the beast he said and so we see it and then then comes reformers luther comes out and he begins to preach against it and they come out of it but what does the beast do he prevails then wesley comes and he preaches and i love the people out of the wesleyan revival charles persian and those great evangelists of them days they're inspiring but what happened they got gobbled up you know they said charles virgin smoked a cigar you know why because the doctor told him it was good for him it would help him preach better again it would help him do better but you know the lord dealt with them and he gave it up amen and we see these beasts and we see this thing coming so we see that spirit coming up then god sent men and the reformers and it got denominated and it got denominated and finally it comes to this age this is the age that the eagle went for amen can the eagle's a what a seer isn't that what he said blessed it's beautiful to see those things and what did the eagle do it showed us it opened the seals and showed us this spirit coming up to this day when it was finally going to form into the worship of the beast the world council of churches but god also had beast and the last beast is an eagle and that calls out a bride and now it comes to a time where the bride and the beast are meeting right now the battle's on right now it's right now that that this spirit is forcing people to accept its mark which is on the mind and the hand and it's forcing people to accept the lukewarm preaching of the gospel as satisfied water it's forcing people to drink and to settle for a drink from something man-made i thank god for a life-living word message it's forcing them into those things he said in paragraph 58 and i spoke against the nomination systems right then and i still believe tonight that it's a cesspool that it's a place where a filth runs into it i can't believe that god would ever take such a thing in his church because it's got to be born of the spirit of god then cleanse before it can be called his the mystical body of christ we are baptized into it by baptism of the holy ghost paragraph 61 and we are invited like israel so it is now to look to israel for examples they as long as they stayed with the fountain they were all right but when they got to hewing themselves out cisterns and man-made systems then god left them flat he'll do us the same they have forsook him the fountain of living water that was the complaint that god had against them they made something that they could say see what we've done and when in times of the travel of moses when god by grace gave them a prophet and gave them a pillar of fire to go before them and vindicated it by signs and wonders grace had provided all those things israel still wanted and saw law they refused the grace to take law that's exactly what the people does today they refuse the word to take a denominational system because in that they can do what they want to and get away with it but you can't do it in christ you've got to come clean and clear in order to be in christ leaving the artesian well for a man-made system or cisterns could you imagine someone doing that could you imagine the mental condition of people that could drink at a fresh artesian well and would leave that for a man-made cistern with frogs lizards wiggle tails and everything else it don't seem even sensible to be right but that's just exactly what the people has done they left the word the true fountain of god's source and power now let me tell you it's the fountain that's the source of the power the word is letter and it killeth but the living waters what gives the word its power it's god's source of power to drink out of a cistern and make themselves cisterns same as they did then they've done the same thing now and then we're going to play 15 minutes it's 12 o'clock but we'll be good and that's the same way this is paragraph 65 and that's the way it is with a lot of these parasites today you can't live in fresh water of the holy spirit that's the reason they'll serve so firmly against the word and say it contradicts itself there is nothing to it because they have some kind of stagnant pool to to wiggle in stagnant do you know the people that have left the message if you talk to them a little while it they just got tired of it it never brought them any higher it was the same old stories the same old gospel the same old every day kept looking back kept looking back they never saw what was revealed was the artesian whale he says that's the same way it is with frogs and lizards and with tadpoles and such as that they've got to get around the swamp or the stagnant pool to live for it's their nature to live there and you can't change the animal until you change its nature and you cannot make a man see the word of god till his nature has been changed and when his nature has changed from what he is to a son of god and the holy spirit comes into him the holy spirit wrote the word so if the holy spirit wrote the word the word bears witness of the holy spirit now we talked about the cistern right we talked about its characteristics anything could live there it catches everything it just gets stagnant living in the same place all the time same doctrine same revelation same routine but let's i was going to preach this next part but i thought you know i'd like us all to listen to brother branham preach about the artesian well what it god has provided for us to drink from and what its characteristics are what what are we know what the characteristics of an art of a cistern is gets old it gets stagnant it's filthy it's empty it doesn't hold water you can't rely on it the only time it's filled up is when there's a revival but listen to brother branham talk about what it happens what that living fountain was that they walked away from i just couldn't preach it like he could preach it but these are some of the things he says about that fountain and we'll listen to it it's self-supporting it's living it's constantly changing bringing something new all the time it draws its resources from the eternal word of god are you good to listen to 15 minutes amen amen and and and i invite you if you if if you can stand up if you're weary but this 15 minutes i think is wonderful and so i want to look at myself and say lord do i have a cistern am i a sister if not how do i get rid of this nature what do what do i do to not be stagnant what do i do not to be catching these lizards and these frogs and this bug juice what do i do let's listen as the messenger of the age who just told us this cistern this mark of the beast is forming it's forming right here now in america the image to the beast coming up taking the mark of the beast on our foreheads in our hands what's our way of escape what brings to us the seal of god amen can we play that brother mike brother davey broken cisterns maybe you can even get it up on your phones i guess nowadays if you want to do notes i don't care just turn your ringer off as we listen to brother branham in broken cisterns talk to us about what god's answer is or what israel walked away from and let's examine ourselves and may god if you're away from this fountain may you come back to it this morning god bless you see denominations make stagnant pools where men can live with women and their women can carry on and cut their hair and wear shorts and anything else and call themselves christians but a genuine fountain hallelujah of the power of god it can't stay there because it pushes it out [Music] i am the fountain of living waters they left me to dig themselves some cisterns now a fountain of living water we find out what is a fountain of living water we find out what the cistern is now what is a fountain of living water it's an artesian well an artesian well what's that brother brown it's a well that it's always comes from beneath and pushes this water out it's flowing all the time it is self-supporting always fresh and clean an artesian well a fountain of living water it's not dead stagnated it's living it's constantly changing bringing up something new all the time moving on coming from its resources it draws its resources from from its bed which is a still a fountain of living water spraying up self cleansing is clean pure clean water it's self-supporting you don't have to wait for the rains to fill its tank up it's always a bubbling up gives us water free you don't have to pump it wind it twist it or join it it's just a fountain of living waters you know you take these old cisterns you have to crank it and crank it and crank it and pump and everything to get a little less stagnated water out but a fountain of lean water gives it out free without pumping jordan anything else oh i'm glad for that fountain amen yes sir it needs no strainer on it to take the parasites out force coming so deep down there in the rock until there's no parasites there it don't have to have an educational rag hanging on it that's right some worldly made system of man-made denominational wisdom they'll tell you before a psychiatrist whether you're able to preach or not they don't have one of those filthy rags hanging on it it push it right off as soon as you put it on there you can't do it that well is bubbling up all the time you put one of them rags on it thought one out of the one side of the other they don't have no time for a denominational rag on it you don't need no filter no strainer no pumping no jerking no nothing else it's just there bubbling up [Music] it don't have to depend on local rings to fill it up rings are revivals for that fountain that's at the fountain of life where the carcass is the eagles are gathered you don't have to pump up a revival you don't have to pump up nothing only thing you have to do is just come to the fountain it's always full of good fresh water and there's no end to it it just keeps on bubbling you don't have to go with the sisters say well if it rains and washes off the barn we'll have something to drink my mind not this that artesian well spurting forth good cold water all the time you can depend on it you don't have to say well i'll go to this old cistern we used to drink out of it but it hasn't rained in a long time i'll tell you it may be dry that's why some of these man-made systems are you can go in if you got a big something going on a big caboose selling something or or some kind of something going on a big parties and things going on bunk hole games and parties in the basement everything you might find a full house but where you go to where that fountain is bubbling up always the people are getting you a good cold drink of water you can depend on it say they haven't had a revival for 10 years if you live with that fountain she's always got a revival going on like the little welshman said or one time when they had the welsh revival going on there's some dignitaries from the states some of these great doctors of divinity went over to wales to find out where and what all this was about so they had on their turnaround collars and their plug hats and this walking down the street and here come a little couple home willing his little billy club in his hand whistling down at the cross where my savior died down there for cleansing from sin i cried there to my heart was a blood applied glory to his name walking down the street so they said this seems to be a religious man we'll go ask him and he said mister said yes sir he said we are here from the united states we're a delegation we come over here to investigate the welsh revival so-called we are doctors of divinity and we are here to look it over he said we want to know where the revival is and where it's held he said sir you have arrived hallelujah i am the welch revival the welch revivals in me here's where it's at that's the way it is when you live with that fountain of living waters it's living all the time bubbling over and over and over and over there's no end to it i'll go see if some water if we had a rain here not long ago that's not it it's that fountain of living water as i said gives us water free don't have to put rags on it to find out some educational rags before you send him out to preach to see if he spells his words right speaks them right if he uses the nouns and pronouns and so forth and adjectives many of them don't even know what they are but he's living at the fountain just the same see they don't have to depend on the local range to fill it up for the local revivals for it don't have to do that for its power and its purity is within itself that's where the word is its own power when a man can receive it in his heart it's got its purity it's got its power it's right in the word itself springs forth to life israel would get away from it they'd get in trouble every time they got away from it they got in trouble the same as we do now when the revival gets away from that then it's no good it digs itself some wells and or some stagnated cisterns and there it goes but he always helped him the murmuring at the red sea then when they murmured yet and all that he had promised made him a promise he should have turned it back right there away we'd look at it but he had promised to take him over there what did he do then children of israel he furnished them the pillar of fire and everything for vindication their prophet and they let him out there to the sea and always his trouble against it and here come the pharaoh in his army and you know what god did he just opened up that red stagnated cistern the dead sees a deadest thing in the world it's really dead stagnated nothing can live in it and he opened it up and set them free on the other side he took them to where they wouldn't have to be bound by such a thing as that in the wilderness they found that the tanks could not be depended on they were dry found out they go from one water hole to another when they was in the water that said starving to death for a drink of water and they go to this tank over here upon is dried up they went to another place it was dried up they just couldn't think this was ever going to get a drink and then on the most unlikely place in all the desert they found the water it was in a rock it was in iraq the most unlikely place that a man would find any water would be in a dry rock in the middle of a desert but you see god does things like that and the most unlikely place in the most unusual way that's what we've always had they think you have to have a big denominations all together and let them all come together and have a great big milling around and so forth and get thousands to cooperate and all like this to have a revival sometime god takes the little old guy don't even know his abc's and right amongst a bunch of illiterate people that hardly knows her right hand from the left he can raise up a revival that'll shake the world he did to the time of john he done in the time of the prophets none of them as we know i was ever educated but god could get a hold of him and do something with him in this rock came forth the waters he was a rock and he commanded this rock and must be smoke and he gave abundance of pure fresh clean water to everybody that would drink he saved all who would drink from it a perfect parallel john 3 16 god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son whosoever believeth on him should not perish but would have everlasting life god smoked that rock on calvary our judgment is upon him that from him might come the spirit of life that would give you and me eternal life that's a perfect parable of it there in this wilderness they never had to pull dig pump or anything just partake of his provided way freely when they didn't have to dig it out of a pond they didn't have to pull it up with a bucket they didn't have to have no window to get it with they just had to partake of it and that's all there is now you don't have to join nothing you don't have to get out the altar and work up something pumping it you don't have to say a word over and over and over until you get a confusion of language the only thing you have is just partake of him for you god's provided way no pumping no pushing no nothing just take of it freely nothing you have to do just partake of it that is just believe it that's all i can say to it they never had to do anything for it never had to dig for it they never had to get down and cry all night for it they just for talk of it it was smitten and ready that's right i'm looking at a man now sitting in the back of the room here i remember telling that on an old barn stall one day by a manger and he said but i'm no good i said i know you're not and i said i'm not either but i said you're looking at what you are quit looking at what you are look what he is he said if i could just get rid of these cigarettes brother brahm i i'd be a christian i said don't get rid of them you're trying to get good and then come to him he never come to save good man he come to save bad men and know they were bad he said well i said listen you don't want to go to hell do you he said no i said well you don't have to he died that you might not have to go he said what do i have to do i said nothing it says that simple he said but if i could ever i said there you go back to that cigarette again quit thinking about that cigarette just remember think about him what he did what he is not what you are you're no good and you never was never will be but what he is he's the one and i said now the only one thing you have to do if he tucked your place down you just willingly accept what he did the only thing you have to do is just accept it well i said that's simple i'll do that i said here's the creek i brought him up here and baptized him in the name of jesus christ some of these people are sitting here and i i know they felt funny at me for doing that but i know what i was doing i seen in the man something that was genuine i could see it there and i took him and baptized him in the name of the lord jesus and when we did that it wasn't long after that just went down to his son's house we've seen a vision of a tree being broke at a certain place and the man fell almost broke his back took him in the hospital that night the lord revealed to me that was the end of cigarettes so the next day he wanted some cigarettes i said i'll buy him a carton and take it to you you just watch and see his cigarette days are done he's never smoked one since never wanted one sansa god see the first thing you've got to do is to come to that fountain you've got to come to that water realize it's nothing that you can do it's what he done for you you don't have to dig you don't have to pump out you don't have to quit this you don't have to quit that the only thing you have to do is get there and drink that's all your thirsty drink now he was the wrong god smoting for us and he gave forth abundance of pure clean water he does yet today to everyone that will believe this is his grace of course to his people us they something like they're like the people of today ready to receive what they can get but don't want to give any service in return israel was ready to to drink from the rock now but they didn't want to give god his service that was doing and he's always given us a service you know we can't even breathe without him we can't breathe without god's service that's how dependent we are on him and yet it almost breaks us into if we try to have to do something for him he asks us to do something go see somebody go pray for somebody go help somebody it's almost breaks us up to do it but we don't want to do anything to him for service his complaint was they have forsaken me the word and have accepted a broken cistern instead except they have forsaken me the fountain of life the fountain of water of life and they desire and would rather drink from a stagnated sister could you imagine that you see the beauty of it you don't go get clean you drink the water and it makes you clean that that's that's what they left they left drinking the water as being the source of their power and they made something else in other words i'm going to go get rid of this i'm going to go get rid of that it's a cistern it's a cistern it'll never keep the frogs away it'll never keep the lizards away but did you see what he said he came for men that know that they're bad and what did he do he provided him a drink and that's why he said i know a bunch of people are looking funny at me because that man was still smoking but that man was thirsty and the only way that man could get rid of those cigarettes was to take a drink i don't care what's bothering you left the internet gossip style fashion unrighteousness no matter what it is that god provided away not your system not your way of getting over it not your way of overcoming not you making a rules and laws but simply take a drink it's there for anybody who will drink he's not he's no respecter of person it's there it's what he said it's there it's self-cleaning so if you put the water in it's what cleans he said that rags it'll push it off he says those bugs and stuff can't come there because it's always pushing it out it's always pushing them away see if it's stagnant it attracts if it's living and bubbling those things can't live there it's the power of god and god made it so simple drink there's a fountain drink he said come unto me all you that heavy laden i'll give you rest come on me i am the fountain of living water come and drink freely drink freely this morning that's what we've got to get back to if not we're going to take this message and we're going to dig this message a shovel and we're going to take our ideas and we're going to dig something that's ourselves our way of judging one another our way of looking at one another our way of putting the gospel together putting all the teachings together and the prophet of god said this whole system came out in this day it forms the mark of the beast the image of rome and god provides a living fountain i'm looking for that fountain of living water to come forth gushing forth in a bride amen from the bedrock of god's word of eternity that fountain is what's flowing out not a sister not a system but living water the power of god in god's people why because they're drinking if you don't drink what happens it's stagnant you just can't say oh i believe the message you've got to have the god because he said it keeps changing every day there's more revelation coming forth more life coming forth god wants to give each of us more power blessed is he that overcometh in this day more of him so if if you're if you're in my medicine today if you look at yourself and you say i i'm becoming a one person denomination i'm stagnant i've got all this stuff how do i get out of this condition how do i change this nature take a drink that water will change your nature you can't overcome without a drink this morning in fact you can't even continue on in this message intellectually you've got to have a drink you you understand if if it was the fountain that caused the prophet to say what he said what he said was bearing witness of the fountain and that's what he put on display was this fountain of living water we don't want to take this message and dig a cistern and put this message in it where it becomes stagnant no we want the fountain that brought the message because the message was this fountain can live in you also do you want to drink from that this morning amen if you've got away from that fountain won't you come back to it won't you ask him won't you get back in a closet somewhat and and don't go thinking in your mind just say lord just give me a drink but just just a drink do you remember what the rich man was he sat in there and he said oh just send lazarus to just dip his finger in water and lay it on my tongue that's because he didn't drink well the fountain was there it may not say this humbly and it applies to me too we will not be able to finish this journey without fresh water we will perish in this spiritual wilderness not a revival but unplugging the brook of living water and the life that's in that seed and letting it flow freely if we're going to be successful we're only going to be spiritually successful if the living fountain is flowing in us lord let me drink let me drink we've got three young men this morning another femme brother marco and brother lambert i hope they're here this morning i call them lamborghini and i believe that they want to take the first step in the drinking from this fountain i hope i don't embarrass brother lamb but i am blessed to remember i said remember why do you want to get baptized he says i know if i don't get baptized i'm only going to get worse i thought praise god it remind me of little benjamin i said little benjamin i'm not going to bother baptize you he says well then i'll go someplace else to get baptized amen don't you want that water this morning don't you want that fountain it's our success it's the only way we're going to make it you i i've worked so hard to overcome certain things i work every day i work so hard i don't want to be the way that i am and what do i look at myself i just keep building systems and man-made things and and i got so tired of it i said lord give me a drink i just want to go back to where it was when i took my first drink when that water was so cool and it just come down my throat and it it just seemed to push all the sin off of me and all the weight off of me and then i've tried to serve them and and i want to give my service for that drink but what happens if your service takes you away from the fountain and pretty soon you're doing god a service without it being his will what do you got to do you got to stop you got to lay everything down and say i'll perish without a drink lord give me a drink i think brother samuel is going to help me baptize this morning so if the young men that would come this morning to be baptized if you'd come here and i'm going to go prepare for baptism because i just believe that those streams of warm water are moving across the baptistry this morning don't you that it really do something for these young men so god bless you if you're here if you'd come and i don't know if they all were able to make it because some of them relying on their parents and and situations arrive but when a young person wants to be baptized i always make sure that they they talk to their parents first and i i i don't want to baptize them unless their parents feel they're ready and sometimes their parents aren't ready so they might not let them get baptized but if god's god's child god will get their parents ready too so you you understand it's a delicate situation but but all these young people talk to their parents and their parents feel that they're ready brother ram said when do you baptize somebody when they're ready when they want to do it right then even for children you never stop them from doing the right thing and these young men that are being baptized today they're well into the age of accountability so amen is that going to be our hearts desire to take a drink if you're discouraged with yourself and you look at yourself take the advice of the prophet quit looking at yourself look at him he's holding a cup out to you take a drink and live look and live drink and live this morning god bless you
