ghost oh you filled me with the holy ghost where are you sure to me with the holy ghost [Music] when i was sick [Music] [Music] hallelujah oh [Music] god is so good amen i will just take this opportunity to take up the ties and offerings and take some prayer requests before the people if they can just play something lightly brother i believe it's brother jeremy new dondo writes udondo writes we thank the lord jesus christ for his kindness to us he took care of our children throughout the school year from beginning to end he is the alpha and omega may his name be praised amen i believe we all can thank god for looking out over our families and taking care of our children and helping us through school why he's so faithful to us amen amen praise the lord brother joelle writes please pray for comfort for the flores family at the lost of a loved one and also just ask prayer for joanna dominguez my mom for strength as she heals and also um sister holly is asking for prayer for her mom lana as she had cataract surgery and it's not healing properly so we just pray this be an opportunity for jesus christ to express he's the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that amen amen sometimes god allows little trials to come our way to give us an opportunity to say or to do something or allows us to have an infirmity in our body to know that he's a healer if you never were sick you wouldn't know he was a healer if you were never lost you wouldn't know he was a savior it's amazing how the devil turns that around on us and tries to to beat us up but praise god i was lost that i could know him in his attributes amen praise the lord let's just go before the lord heavenly father we love you lord we think of these needs that have been read we're thankful that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord your word said that by your stripes we are healed so lord we claim this healing that you purchased for us by your stripes lord not only for ourselves but for our loved ones for sister holly's mother lana lord i pray that you would be merciful to her lord touch your eyes lord may they be better than they've ever been may that be the testimony that would come from our own mouth that she would give you the glory we pray lord for the lost loved ones lord as we even read the the psalm lord precious is the death of your saints lord as you would bring them across the border lord i don't know all those that have gone on lord but we just trust that you would be a comforter to the family during this time that they would experience your love your rich your grace your mercy in a greater measure than they ever have before lord we just love you we pray a blessing upon the tithes and offerings now we ask it in your name the lord jesus christ amen

right spirit [Music] god bless you this morning let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer heavenly father lord our desire is to have a clean heart before you lord jesus lord to present ourselves as living sacrifices oh god that would be holy and acceptable unto you lord god lord your scripture said that that's our reasonable service oh god and surely we can say amen to that lord for you laid your life down o god but even more than that you took it back up again oh lord to prove that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord and you've come in this day and revealed yourself unto us once again lord [Music] lord as we've come together to fellowship around your word oh god we just pray lord for all those that are traveling lord and ministering this morning lord our pastor and brother billy is there traveling in different ones oh god that you just strengthen them by the holy ghost oh god right now lord to inspire them and give them manifestation of your spirit lord to speak the word lord wherever they may be lord and we know that you'll be with us here as well this morning lord you promise wherever two or three are gathered you'll be there in the midst lord we can say amen to that even now and know lord that you're here amongst your people lord if there were any hurting oh god just pray that you'd bind them up oh god and anoint them with the i salve lord anoint them with the healing balm of gilead lord you draw us closer unto you lord jesus may your perfect will be done lord that you would speak unto your people lord god help us to get out of the way and let your holy spirit speak lord this morning we just praise you lord god if there's any ones that have any burdens lord may they just lay them down right now at the altar lord of the heart and lord may the fire lord of the holy ghost come and just consume the sacrifice and burn every binding force lord that would try to hold your people down lord in the name of jesus christ we just bind that devil now we place it where he belongs under our feet lord and we just continue to step forward and by the grace of the holy ghost lord for those footsteps our possession of god just pray that you'd be with us now in the name of the lord jesus christ as we open the word this morning let your perfect will be done lord god in the name of jesus christ we pray amen personally grateful to be here amongst believers this morning appreciate the wonderful spirit that's here and let's just turn in our bibles if we could to the book of first corinthians chapter two certainly our our prayers and thoughts and our our hearts are with our pastor and brother billy and all the ones traveling we're all part of the same body so we know right now that that part of the body is working this part of the body is going to go to work by the grace of god we've come to to hear from the lord this morning so just pray that you pull upon the gift of god not that i would be anything or any person but may the lord jesus get all the glory we lift up no other name but the name of jesus christ and uh just say before we preach you know before we minister by his grace that he just so inspired by uh the things that were kind of ministered this last wednesday and kind of had some different thoughts maybe of a direction to go but then the lord kind of you know the lord will turn you around where he wants to go you know so we just pray that you just pull upon the word and let the lord have his perfect way and then we'll start at verse six and we're going to read to the end of the chapter here it says how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of the this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written eye hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words of man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth conspiracy comparing spiritual things with spiritual not the but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ amen and let's just turn over one one more scripture here ephesians chapter 3. i'll read verses 8 through 11. unto me whom less than the least of all saints is this grace given that i should preach among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ and to make all men see what is the fellowship of the mystery which from before from the beginning of the world hath been hid in god who created all things by jesus christ to the intent that now under the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of god according to the eternal purpose which he purposed in christ jesus our lord amen let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord as we've just opened your word lord to read the scriptures father we know only the holy ghost lord your spirit can minister it unto our hearts lord and open up a revelation to us oh god so we just pray right now oh god that you would break the bread of life to us once again lord may you just speak unto your people lord and bless your word in the name of jesus christ we pray amen you may be seated i was just really blessed particularly this wednesday on the little bit that we got to hear from our pastor you know and when obviously ministering on who is this melchizedek and uh we'll just probably start really slow here uh you know the lord you know i know he works in all of us in different ways and i know maybe he works by his grace through me in a way that might be a little bit different but we're just trusting that the lord will be able to express what you know he will what maybe he's shown or given to me the by his grace the way that he gave it to me but uh if i could maybe just give a title to this if we could preach on the fellowship of the mystery i was so impressed and and blessed by this wednesday by just a simple thought you know i've administered a couple times back even and really been maybe preaching on the different aspects of of of a person as it were how we have the five channels to the spirit and the five channels to the to the flesh to contact this world and so many times we rely too many on those things too many times on those things we we we take things that we call face value we see something and we just take that that is what it is whether it be a sickness or or something that we're dealing with in our lives we we can only see what's in front of us and what maybe many times we don't maybe live in the spiritual the way we ought to to understand that the lord is ultimately in control but i'm blessed by the fact that our prophet told us that the word of god will defeat satan in any circumstance no matter what you can see no matter what it looks like the word of god will defeat satan in any place anytime and under any condition because it isn't about us as it were but it's about god revealing himself and manifesting himself through his bride through in this time now us whereas before in times past the scripture says that god had revealed himself through the prophets and these different things he says he's now revealed himself through his son and now beyond that he came in the form of the holy ghost and is now living in a bride in his people to reveal himself to the world but see to the world it's a mystery the rest of the world the the the things that the hidden things of god cannot be understood by a mental conception they can't be understood by just study and reasoning and all those things in fact we understand that reasoning is what got us into this mess in the first place because satan came and said hath god not said hath not god said you shall you shall eat of every fruit of the tree of the garden and one of these little things that he tried to to pique the interest of eve in the garden and say god knows if you were to partake of these things you'll become as gods and that's what he's done in this age he said if you could just learn this wisdom this natural wisdom you can come up to this place you'll become greater than anything you'll become a superman a superwoman whatever it might be and to the natural man it looks really good the technology of the age has come higher and higher and higher and the the things that we understand maybe a quarter of the natural have come higher and higher but we see that as man has come higher and higher according to the tree of knowledge they've become farther and farther away from a knowledge of god and we're finding a contrast becoming greater and greater whereas one side the children of man would become greater and greater in knowledge of the world but the children of god the people of god are becoming actually simpler and simpler to the point where the only thing we can believe is the word of god no matter what it looks like no matter how crazy it sounds no matter how insane it looks to the world we've become actually more simple minded as pertaining to the things of the world why that's why paul would say in first first corinthians here if we turn back he says we're not preaching according to the wisdom of man because the carnal mind is enmity with god the carnal mind cannot understand the things of god it's just not possible too many times we find ourselves frustrated because we're trying to to force a revelation into somebody our desire so much is our loved ones if you could just see it you want to shake them if they could just see what i see but maybe it hasn't been revealed to them yet if they could just understand what god's given to me so many i i feel i go to work you know and worldly people all around and they'll talk about goings-on in the world we see what's happening now with israel and and all these things and we know that's god's timepiece so if israel's stirring maybe god's getting ready to stir something and we know even now he's stirring in the hearts of the people i've i've felt it even in my spirit in my soul god's just stirring there's something fixing to happen and you hear people talk about it in a carnal manner you know around you know you may you know rub shoulders with the world those of us that have to work around people that aren't believers and they say oh can you believe what's going on and they they can see that something's wrong and you just want to grab them and say if you could just see it's the spirit of god working it's the spirit of of of the antichrist beginning to stir and to bind up tears meanwhile the the wheat is being bound and drawn together to be placed into the into the garner but we can't do it in an intellectual conception it can't be done no matter how much word they could know people that you might know might even know their bible sometimes better than you i've known many denominational believers who could know the scripture and recite things front to back but something as simple as the baptism in the name of jesus christ would be hidden from them why because it it's not based upon the wisdom of man god actually you know god delights in hiding it from the wise and prudent he said it please god to hide these things from the wise and prudent but he revealed them unto babes that would learn someone that could be so simple-minded could i say that could just be so crazy enough to say god said it so i believe it and when someone questions you and says how shall these things be they say i don't i don't know but god said it's not my it's not my job to know and i know we've ministered on some of these things quite a few times before lately but we've got to get ourselves out of trying to understand the how and understand that it will what time it happens i don't know how it will come i don't know but i do know that his word is true and it must come to pass but see none of these things can happen before the time he that endureth unto the end he that endureth unto the end how many believe we're at the end i believe we're at the end we're right at the end con almost with your spiritual eyes it's almost as if in the spiritual you can see the finish line right there just beyond our reach but it can't come before the time and we're talking about a fellowship of the mystery you see there's a mystery that's been hidden you see god delights to hide deuteronomy says that the hidden things belong to god deuteronomy 29 29 the hidden things belong to god but the revealed things belong unto us [Applause] and so many times we get caught up oh i want to know all the hidden things you'll know what he needs you to know how will you know a rapture is taking us away and the body changes here we understand the rapture is already even in process now but how will we know what body change is going to happen you know how i'm going to know because my body's going to be changed [Applause] because god interprets his word by bringing it to pass he doesn't interpret his word by allowing me to explain it all to you that's why they didn't like brother branham so much because he spoke in parables he's spoken mysteries he spoke in a way that the scholar the theologian couldn't just put their finger on it quite why because it was a spiritually discerned revelation if it was based on intellectuals we would all miss it well most of us maybe some of you are here are really intellectual if it was based on intellectuals but i know i'd miss it if it was on intellectuals because i don't understand many of the things i wish i did my i believe everyone's desire here the desire of a holy ghost filled believer is to understand it to fulfill the perfect will of god for their life but many times we don't know what exactly lays in store for us around the corner that's why it's based on faith if it was based on what we know there'd be no faith even the lord had to even rebuke brother branham on it and say if i gave you a vision for everything you wouldn't even be walking by faith anymore because you know the visions come to pass so how much for us who don't have that prophetic gift god is delights do you know how much it delights god when his children could be in situations that they don't understand can be in places where it looks like there's no way out where the only way that they could get out is a complete mystery and they don't even know the children of god don't even know what weighs out but they can stand there and say though he slay me yet i'll trust him oh my god why because you've been sealed into a kingdom and the world cannot understand you i was so blessed how our pastor he taught he called it just a little appetizer and i was just like brother give us the main course i need some more but do you understand see we i don't i'm not gonna we're not going deep because i don't understand all these things when it comes to the seven seals and the seven thunders i wouldn't claim to know i wouldn't claim to know all that i'll know it when he needs me to know you know when it's revealed the way it needs to be revealed to me i'll know and you'll know why because we're holy ghost-filled believers that mystery already lays in the seed that acorn paul said he said we don't know what we shall be but we do know that when he comes we'll see him as he is for we shall be like him if you were to take an acorn and you just took that acorn and looked at it it does not give you an intellectual conception of what an oak tree is you can't look at an acorn unless you've already got a revelation or a previous knowledge of what that will become or what it was if you just took an acorn and placed it before you without any other intellectual knowledge of what that thing would grow into you would have no idea that that little thing would grow into this great tree yet every acorn and every other seed that would ever be born from that tree is already in that seed so is it with you children of god you don't know even what lays in you yet but rest assured that when he comes you're gonna be just like him because even right now he's molding you he's making you he is transforming you i was struck you know the scripture says be not conformed to the image of this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind and i i thought about that scripture just a couple weeks ago and i was like wow don't be conformed and i was thinking well what is conforming conforming is worse you you stuff something in there if you have like a a squishy ball and you stuff it into a square box it'll conform to the shape of the box and i thought you know that's just like how the world tries to do with a christian they try to take you and shove you into their little boxes to make you conform to what their image of a person ought to be and even worse in this day the world tries to make you conform as believers of a truth that's beyond anything the rest of the world's got they try to make you conform to what their intellectual conception of a christian is and the problem is their conception of a christian is actually none other than antichrist because their idea of a christian just goes with the flow just takes whatever's given to them doesn't stand up for the truth is it under the backbone to stand up and call right right and wrong wrong and say a christian god is love god is love their perverted version of filial love is nothing but garbage how can you claim to be a christian and don't love the homosexual and don't love i do love them but it's because we love people in sin that we come and say come out of that but the world wants you to be conformed and i thought oh my that's a dirty word conform that sounds horrible but you know the scripture wants you to be conformed we conform and as we conform we become transformed see that's the difference satan can't transform you because he doesn't have creative power he can only take what's already there and try to pervert and twist and mold and squish and move and but god if you don't got the holy ghost yet you just keep pressing you just keep conforming to this worm because as you conform to this it becomes part of you and before you know it you've been transformed hallelujah don't give up don't stop pressing that's the problem right now the scripture says that he would wear out the saints that's exactly what the devil's trying to do right now it's just wear you out wear you down it's like it's like a wave on the seashore just lapping in over and over and just trying to wear away wear away wear but i tell you what brothers and sisters if you're founded upon a rock the scripture says the waves beat and the wind blew but the but the house stood because it was founded on a rock and what is that rock it's the revelation it's the mystery that's been revealed to you and you alone i don't have brother matthew's revelation because it wasn't given to me that way i didn't come the same path but we came to the same revelation if i could say it that way see that's that's the perversion and satan he's so clever with his with his word tricks and the way he can do things because now people oh there's many paths to god and that's true in a sense everybody's life path has taken them different places some of you struggle with alcohol some of you with drugs some of you with women some of you with this and with that and with the other all these different things those were different life paths that god had to take you down but i can tell you one thing the only place that it led you to was the door jesus christ and him alone they can say oh see they take it the devil takes it a step farther and says oh it's oh it could be buddha it could be muhammad it could be this and that and the other no sir i don't care what life you came from the only truth there is is jesus christ but see you become a mystery when you're sealed into this kingdom see because what is a seal brother brahm described it many ways he taught he talked about he said it signifies ownership see there's a reason the world don't like you it's because when that seals upon you everybody can see whether they know it consciously or not those devils can see who owns you he said set a seal upon their foreheads for those who sigh and cry for the abominations done in the city and he said they went around and put the seal on the forehead he said grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby ye are sealed unto the day of your redemption see the scripture says that if you will accept the testimony of him who god has sent it says he has set to his seal that god is true oh my you want to receive the seal then you have to set him as your seal that he is true but what happened god sealed you into his kingdom and whether you see it or not you wonder why do people don't like me why do people look at me funny why do people can't understand me that's because they're not in the mystery see you've been sealed in they've been sealed out and the only way to come in is to come in the same way you came in which is to be born again because then if they come into that now they're in the fellowship of the mystery but meanwhile we walk around and the whole world all the devils of hell know who you belong to because you've been sealed you've been marked god said this is mine don't you touch it devil and don't you don't you better believe he's gonna try he's gonna batter you with everything he can but what does that seal do he said it locks you up into your destination there's nothing that can mess with that car that railroad car until it hits the destination but you become a living epistle but did you know if i could say it this way just like the seven sealed book of redemption you become a sealed book to the rest of the world you become a sealed book they can't understand you brother branham talks about the seals and how when we saw the seals in revelation before any of the real revelation came but when we read the seals how a seal was broken and there's like a little symbol he said what was it we were just seeing the outside of it a little glimpse but we couldn't truly understand we couldn't truly have a revelation because it wasn't the time yet and yet god was working the whole time throughout all those church ages those horse riders were right god was working the holy ghost moving but it was a mystery sealed up and so are you when you're sealed into this kingdom you become a mystery to the world the only thing they can see on the outside of you sisters it's a symbol they don't understand it the carnal mind can't understand that symbol of long dress long hair modesty they can't see it why because they're not inside the book only those that are in the book can understand the book [Applause] so how could they understand it that's why you can't educate someone into it it's a sealed mystery you're a sealed mystery to the world he's sealed it up locked it inside of you that's why sometimes you don't even understand the things you're doing i love the way our pastor said he said one of these days that seal on your life is gonna break and it's gonna reveal who you were the whole time that's what he did in the seals he started breaking those seals first see a white horse rider what was it it wasn't something that had just happened he was revealing what he'd already been doing the whole time hallelujah it's so fixed brothers sisters the works were finished before the foundation of the world he's hidden it from the eyes of the wise and prudent but he's revealing it to us he's revealing it we don't even understand it so many times mentally but spiritually there's something that seed inside cries out for more because it knows it can only recognize itself the word can only recognize the word that's why paul said we groan within ourselves he said and many times we utter words that we don't even understand we groan with groanings we don't understand why because there's a lot how can you mentally we've never experienced theophany we never experienced glorified bodies but there's something in us that knows what it is there's a seed in us that came from glory that's going back to glory there's a seed that knows where it's going there's a piece of you that understands without words without intellect that jesus christ is coming he's even here now he's prepping the bride to take her away and we grown for that we desire that that makes you a mystery to the world you're a sealed off book and you can't be that mystery on your life what god has in store for you and i want to take this on all the levels you can think of whether it be a rapture we're all going to be broken at that time that mystery of the rapture will be broken at the time that seal be ripped off that understanding and by seal i mean understanding i'm not talking about seven i don't understand all of all of it i can only give you what the lord's showing me but when that mystery time comes and there's something in the heart of the believer where the lord says come up hither that seal will break this seal of flesh that's been holding you down will break away and this mortal will put on immortality in the moment of a twinkling of an eye but it can't happen before the time think about think about i want you to go through the scripture now think about the mysteries that god does and how he the lord gets glory by hiding things why because if you knew you try to put your hand to it to do it oh i try to make it better oh surely i could do this surely i could do that so in order to keep our little hands off of it many times the lord has to hide it from ourselves the lord even did it with our prophet listen to the message serge is this the time is this the sign of the end brother brandon says i don't know where i'm going i don't know what i'm doing but i just know just like abraham i got to go where he tells me he could see symbols he didn't understand but he knew one thing follow god wherever he leads that's the same place he's bringing his bride to you things happen in your life lord i don't understand i don't know why i'm going where i'm going i don't know why i'm doing what i'm doing but lord i'm gonna trust you that when the time comes how many i mean we can all testify can we not that we've gone through things look back five ten years later maybe more and say lord and he reveals to you what he did he said lord have mercy if i had known what you were doing i would have messed it all up but he gets glory in that because no man has put their hand to it i was loving the old testament he said when he would build an altar he said you build an altar out of earth he said don't put your tool upon it he said if you put your tool on my altar you polluted it and many times we try to put our man-made ideas and our tools to the work of god and we end up polluting the work of god get your hands off of god's work and just let the spirit lead you where you would and you know what you'll be a mystery there will be times you're going to be a mystery to fellow believers you're going to do things that other believers say what are they doing they did it with jesus they did it with paul even peter said he says a lot of things that are hard to be understood paul's kind of a mystery to me but you know what i got a revelation he's a minister for the age i'm gonna i'm gonna believe it i don't understand it but i believe it think about jesus's life even from the very beginning a virgin shall conceive and that mystery was sealed away hundreds of years hundreds of years and then god just begins to break that open and an angel comes to mary hail mary full of grace all these different things and you're gonna have a child and you shall call his name jesus and she says well how shall these things be see even then it was just beginning to unveil unreveal itself to unveil itself and yet it was still hidden it was still it was just beginning and maybe sometimes i almost feel that's where we're at when it comes to a real revelation of of what the lord's brought in our day in this message we've we've started to to peel back the layers and the lord spoken to us and said you're going to have a child jesus christ is going to be born in the bride and we're standing here saying lord how shall these things be i don't understand anything it seems like i'm failing all the time he said the holy ghost shall overshadow you hallelujah you think she still understood it then i don't think so but she believed she went her way and believed and i feel like i just heard someone minister this recently and forgive me if if you know the lord knows i heard this somewhere i thought it was really interesting the way i heard it and i can't remember i heard it from brother branham or from another minister but i really like this because it's about the attitude that you take to the word here was here was mary not educated not any of these things and god comes and says you're going to have a child how shall i have a child not knowing a man the holy ghost shall ever shadow you how shall these things be god has grace grace grace but then you go to i think it i think actually was during the youth meetings maybe is what it was and then he goes to the priest he says this is gonna happen going to have a child and he lord how is it going to happen but he had the wrong attitude he says lord said okay you want to have that attitude see mary asked but she was like lord i don't i really don't understand but i believe i believe it was zechariah right the priest says he says lord how's it going to happen but he kind of had that attitude of almost scoffing right almost a a sarah attitude the many attitude that we get sometimes look there's no way i and i just i have to be real with you because this is the way i think sometimes we all battle i don't want to sugarcoat things it's time we've gotten beyond sugar coating things we got to get down to real business when god tells you you are going to live in overcoming life you are going to be the bride word of this age and you're going to manifest jesus christ in perfection and a rapture is going to come and you say lord there ain't no way you know what you understand that's the natural response because with the knowledge we have of this word we know how far naturally speaking we're far from fulfilling it but then when that revelation comes in when that mystery starts to to unveil itself and you realize it's not about me it's about him it's about glorifying the word of god it's about glorifying jesus christ it's not about what i look like it's all about making sure he gets the glory revealing him to the world through you but one attitude and the angel just continues to explain has grace and the other one says you're gonna be blind now for a season because you couldn't believe this he said you're a scholar you know the scriptures and then you've seen the miracles god has done you know all these scriptures and everything you know that god's able and yet you had this attitude so i'll smite your blind for a season sometimes the lord does that to us we get an attitude and the lord says i'm going to have to i'm going to paddle you a little bit but praise the lord for the chastisement because without chastising it we're bastards and we're not sons and daughters so praise the lord for the chastise but think about that from the very beginning that mystery was just starting to unveil and then it unveiled jesus is born and it's still hidden from the pharisees and sadducees and the rest of the world why because god reveals it to whom he will he will have mercy on whom he will he'll have grace on whom he will i praise the lord he's given me grace i've failed so many times i've stumbled so many times but god still hold it out to me i could never say i'm holding on to him because if it was up to me i would have given up on myself a long time ago but praise the lord the works were ordained before the foundation of the world there's a work that i've got to do there's a work that you have to do that only that part of god that he put in you can fulfill believe brother branham called it like the great orchestra with the conductor if i'm if i'm a trumpet then i can't i can't be the base drummer if i'm the bass drum i can't be the clarinet and so on and so forth down the line we we can't be what we're not meant to be but in that time you know what it's even in that orchestra timing certain parts seem to have a bigger a bigger uh part of the of the song it would seem you had that bass drum just steady beating a beat the whole time right it's just always there it's always steady it's always going it's always strong always oh you can count on that bass drum that's like a lot of people right you just count on that person and then you got the little piccolo and then they're done for like 10 minutes and then that's like a lot of people isn't it they seem a little flighty they seem a little back and forth back and forth but they got a part to play you got the loud brass horns shouted from the rooftops like me and brother matthew we're a little bit louder we may be a little bit lighter it's all right we got a part but then you got that nice little mellow french horn that like really nice and mellow can just really bring a piece to certain things why because it's a gift of god for that gift i love it because god's a god of variety if all were the i where would the hearing be if all the ear where's the feeling but god is placed in the body finley joined together every piece you may not know where you fit yet but don't worry that seal's gonna break the lord's gonna positionally place you right where he needs you to be just like he did joseph joseph had a sealed life he was seeing symbols from the very beginning of his life oh you're all going to bow down to me i had this dream and even his brothers had enough spirituality about him to know that there was something to it even if they didn't like it because they even testified of what was to come oh we're gonna bow down before you actually yes yes you are you don't know it yet but what was it it was a sealed mystery a sealed book his life a complete sealed book that nobody knew didn't see you don't know where the twists and turns are gonna go because we you're not always seeing the inside of the book you're only seeing you can read the the little on a book you have the spine of the book you just read the title and sometimes you just get the cover page and it gives you like a little summary of some certain things that's sometimes what our life is like a sealed book where we can only see just a little bit you understand oh maybe this character is going to play a big part but i don't really understand what's going to happen and here he goes joseph do i don't know do you know i don't know and maybe brother branham said it i don't know when joseph maybe finally came to a full revelation of his purpose the only thing we know is what the scripture says as far as i can tell that when his brothers came to him he said the lord did this that we might spare that we might save life somewhere along the line the lord revealed it to him but you don't think joseph at times wondered what is happening why am i why am i misunderstood why is it when i try to do good evil is always present with me i tried to do the right thing in potiphar's house but evil is present with me that's how it is in this flesh you try to do right and evil is just there trying to beat you down but don't worry when the seal of your life is broken when god begins to reveal to you what she's even doing now just a little by little just a little by little he's revealing to you who you are where you belong where you came from where you're going and it's not according to the mental you say brother what are you going gonna do next month i have no idea why because the children of god as the wind bloweth so is everyone born by the spirit of god you don't know where they come where they're going and you know what many times those children of god don't know where they're coming from or where they're going but what are they doing they're following the leading of the spirit why because they that are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god joseph just being confused i could not even imagine and his but his life was just a sealed book to the rest of him potiphar didn't know what he was pharaoh didn't know what he was until until it was all over and so are you with the rest of the world your family looks at you funny why do you go to that crazy church that cult group that believes in prophets that's what that's what people think that's okay i'm fine with that i bear the reproach it's all right they thought the same when jesus was on the scene they'll think it until the rapture comes that's all right why why are you dressed the way you do sisters your your brothers and sisters some of you may not have family that are saved why do you got a dress like that why don't you wear makeup and go out and do all the things everybody else is doing why because they can't understand you're a sealed book you've been sealed to the day of your redemption you're closed off all they can see is symbols that they can't make out yet the only way they can make it out brothers and sisters is if they're born into that same fellowship of the mystery there's a fellowship to this mystery that you can only find when you're born into the spirit of god and we can try mentally oh i wish you could see this i wish you could can't you see the scriptures yes they surely can just like the pharisees and the sadducees knew the scriptures they they say the stories go i remember hearing this from when i was a kid they said those pharisees were so studied you know because the scrolls everything was rolled up into a scroll like a tube like a poster they said they knew the scripture so good they could put a pin into the scroll and tell you on what letter that pen would stop that's how good they knew their scripture and then when their scripture became manifested in the form of jesus christ they crucified it goes to show it doesn't matter that's why the lord could say to those that were on the outside depart for me that work iniquity i never knew you it's not that he didn't know who they were but it's like that intimate relationship with a husband and a wife i never knew you i didn't know you you didn't know me my character who i am and the only way you can do that is to receive his character is to receive the spirit if that same spirit that raised up jesus christ from the dead dwell in you it shall also quicken your mortal box moses was the same way he was a sealed book really hidden he was like he was like a a super spy in a sense that god created put him right in the midst of the enemy and he was so sealed up that the enemy couldn't see anything they couldn't even see barely the symbols of it because they just let him grow up amongst them meanwhile he was taught by his mother to know he was a proper child to know he was to be a deliverer and yet his own life was hidden from himself because then he tries to go do it himself all i can see the end from the beginning i'm going to be a deliverer i'm going to rip the seal off myself and he kills an egyptian and runs off into the wilderness but then what happens then he meets his god then god really starts to reveal who he is and even then he has the objections i can't speak well the people won't believe me i can't do this and i can't do that he says never mind that moses you maybe can't see the inside of the book yet you can't see it yet but it's it's coming the manifestations coming because there's no one else that i could use he said i have chosen you have not i sent you now let's go and now now he looks even crazier to the egyptians a one-man wrecking crew a one-man invasion coming in to take over the most powerful nation on the planet at the time so were you in this age 200 thousand demons released out of the river euphrates and here stands a bride of jesus christ saying you can't stop us marching forward onward christian soldiers marching as to war with the cross of jesus going on before but he became a mystery to those egyptians they couldn't understand it he says it looks like we're at number two to one janice and jamfers versus moses you had moses and aaron but he had two staff two i like the way they did it in the the the that ten commandments the the movie that they made way way back when and and they throw the sticks down and it's two snakes versus one and he says oh my goodness his snake ate up the rest of them what is it because god's just he delights in that mystery the lord delights in that underdog story that the devil always makes it he makes himself look big and and all these things it's almost like nature nature kind of shows you that a little bit of a type you see these little butterflies they got the big scary looking eyes on the back of it to scare away the frogs it's just nothing but a bluff it's just nothing to keep you away from them and that's what the devil does you know when the shadows start getting long how many of you ever remember when you're a child i was testifying this to somebody i said you know what i start to realize how much of a bluff that devil is and how the tricks he plays because remember we're in that evening time and brother branham called it he said it's a deceptive time it's a deceiving time why because the shadows start to get long the sun starts to get low on the horizon and it kind of kind of blinds you a little bit and and the light's starting to get dim but it's not so dim your eyes haven't adjusted yet you can't really see and the shadows start to get long brother brown even said that he said the evening shadows are falling right now and what happens i i thought forgive me for saying it this way but this is the way the lord kind of revealed it to me was like i thought about those cartoons when i was a child of how the character would be sitting there scared in the dark and the lights and everything and all of a sudden they see this big shadow creeping around the corner and they're like oh my and then they come around it's like it's a little kitten it's a little kitten but what was it the shadows distorted it made it look like it was something it wasn't and that's all the devil is he's using the shadows of this age to make himself all puffed up and look really bad but he's nothing but a bluff he's nothing but a toothless tiger trying to gum you to death [Music] can't do anything to you just a little kitten so don't let the devil bluff you away from it even if you don't understand don't worry about it he's already made a way of escape [Music] if you'll stand he said when you've done all this stuff all you can't do to stand stand he'll make a way of escape if there's anybody that exemplified that more it would be those hebrew boys we've done all we can do so we're going to stand don't know how it's going to happen don't know what's how it's going to go down but all we know is that god's word is true and we're not going to give it up for some denominational creed some idea we're going to stay with this word maybe just the last little example here what about gideon gideon thought himself the least of his house but see there was a seal on him he didn't even know it and the angel comes says thou mighty man of failure and gideon says who are you looking at he was sealed up he didn't even know who he was yet didn't even know the strength that lay in there it says you mighty man a failure by thee i shall use you to help deliver israel ran away from it and he was questioning and saying lord show me this and lord show me that that's where we're at sometimes lord if you just show me this and show me that you know and there's times where you know what get before god make your calling in election sure get before the lord and say lord if you need it settled get there and stay until he settles it and then once he settles it whether you understand or not you may be a mystery you may be a mystery to yourself you don't think i think even brother brandon may have said that at one point and forgive me if i'm putting words in his mouth but i feel like i know i heard him say that what he said he said there will be times you'll be a mystery to yourself you will do things that you don't even understand why because the spirit that's in you is leading you and guiding you and the flesh doesn't understand i'm sure he thought that when he got off of that plane in memphis i'm gonna miss my flight why am i doing this how many times have we heard brother random even testify of all the testimonies he would give he would hear or feel like he heard a voice tell him to do something he said lord am i going crazy am i going crazy you're not going crazy when that when that voice lines up with the word when that still small voice is telling you to go here go there but if gideon didn't even know he didn't understand and then he has to ask over and over again lord show me this show me that and you know what the lord will do it why did he thomas we call him doubting thomas but you know why doubting thomas is there to show that even if you feel like you're in that spot god's got a place for you the devil tries to make you oh you've been struggling you've been battling you don't know this and you don't know that say if thomas can make it so can i if you can say unless i unless the lord shows me this i don't know if i can believe it you know what he'll do it for you he'll do it for you you're part of him he'll do it he's got to he's got it he's got to reveal himself to his people but we have this hidden wisdom it's a fellowship of the mystery it's a sealed book that you've been you've been literally turned into a sealed mystery to the world and i especially felt really impressed upon this with young people when you're going to school college middle school high school elementary school doesn't matter you're not going to look anything like that they're not going to understand you they're going to think you're nuts they're going to think you're crazy why because you are a sealed mystery to those people and all you can do is be that living epistle red of all men you you live the spirit of god in your life show love not the love this world shows where he just oh everything's okay but you i'm praying for you the lord's got something better for you than what you're in you know that that that what we call that love now it's so perverted oh you just tolerate whatever goes on that's their version of love no sir god doesn't just tolerate god transforms god manifests and changes and molds and and can bring deliverance to a person not just looking for a patched up job but a whole new creation creation all new creature in christ but remember the seal cannot be broken until it's time so you know what you just keep eating the word you just keep eating the word we're going to be closing here in just a second i got maybe a couple quotes to read but you know it's like uh it's like a butterfly that's the the impression the lord really really put that really strong was you know we used that that cankerworm caterpillar and all those things on the negative but you know on the positive there's a butterfly and what does that butterfly have to do it looks really ugly and nasty and weird if i could say that it just looks kind of strange but what does it do it starts to eat and eat and eat and eat and then there's that one point where it seals itself away in a little cocoon and you know what happens in there i remember this from when i was a child enough i'm wrong you forgive me but i remember there there's what they call metamorphosis and they say that that that caterpillar literally breaks itself down into almost nothing and then those molecules actually reform themselves completely into a completely new creature sealed away sealed away being broken down and i think and again i could be wrong forgive me if my science is wrong but i remember at least from when a child so my memory is going way back and i'm getting older so maybe my memory is not as good as it was but i remember that i always used to read how they say if you were to break open that cocoon before it was done it would just be a goop why because nature was taking that creature and literally transforming it down to a molecular level now i want you to think of that spiritually what god's doing to his bride right now you who have been sealed away eating on this word eating on this word eating on this word and then he starts to seal you away and put you in a secret place and you know what that secret place isn't always pleasant because you know what happens there you get broken down you know what you start to do you start forgiving you start to die to yourself you start to get broken down until no more of that old caterpillar remains no more of that old person that you once were remains the whole world doesn't see it now because you're sealed away the world may not see the transformation completely on the inside that's happening right now and that's where the devil tried oh you don't see these big things you don't see the big things but don't you worry at a spiritually molecular level god is breaking you down bit by bit and he is reforming you into his image piece by piece by peace and one of these days brothers and sisters he's gonna break that seal that that word cocoon that we've been sealing ourselves up in here he's going to break that and he's going to make manifest what he's been doing since the foundation of the world those works that have been being worked on from before the foundation lord of the works were already finished our pastor even began to preach on that a little bit how how we were already foreordained to the good works to walk in them so don't worry if you don't understand the trials and tribulations don't worry just be sealed in get shut in with god get sealed up with him and just let him start working on you let him start breaking you down and then he'll start building you back up in his image and you'll come out a beautiful manifestation of his glory when we fly away see that that caterpillar at one point was earthbound it was stuck there brothers and sisters it was stuck just crawling like a little worm but it just kept eating just eaten eaten eaten and then when it comes out it spreads its wings and it can fly off into the heavenlies oh glory to god he's got it fixed for you he's got it set just continue to eat this word get yourself sealed away with him seal yourself in seal the world out it doesn't matter how fanatical you look you look fanatical anyway so i got just a couple if i could just read i have a little bit of reading here to do but i believe there's so much good in here and then we'll be we'll close here but i just was really struck by this you know uh we'll read this one first here from paradox because you know that's what you are you're a paradox you're a mystery how can the world be going so crazy how can your life be going different which ways in this way but there's something that just holds you steady you don't you don't have to give up you don't have to just oh it doesn't matter anymore no you're a paradox you're a paradox you're a mystery he says now back in the days of noah before the rain come in the flood it was quite a hard thing for noah in that great intellectual age he lived in to try to tell people by a word of god that it was going to rain now it would be no doubt that it didn't meet the qualification of their scientific research there was no rain in the skies but you see noah said there would be rain because that god said there would be rain and noah by faith before the rain ever come he said it would be there that's the reason we say the same thing that they say why jesus said he was coming a long time ago hundreds of years ago they claimed he was coming the apostles said so maybe their generation isn't that what they said the scripture says for all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation where is the promise of his coming don't you worry it may be sealed up right now we may not understand it but it's it's coming he says that doesn't stop it a bit we still know he is coming how's it going to be i don't know but god will send him he promised to and i know he will be here now noah could only say god said so but you see then after all it did not meet their scientific approval in that day but when the time come for the word to be fulfilled it reigned just the same it was quite a paradox in that day to think that rain could come out of the sky where there is no rain it's quite a paradox for there to come a manifested bride and a body change where it looks like things are getting worse and worse but don't worry it's coming god speaks his word his children believes it and god the science cannot prove how it can be done they know nothing about it but the children believe it anyhow and then god performs i love this and that god performs a paradox makes it so the devil's got nothing to stand on he said they can't be that way god will perform a paradox to make it soul he glories in that praise the lord he performs a paradox and makes it so makes it so because his word that spoke the world into existence can bring can make every word that he ever promised come to pass i want to say that again he makes it so because his word that spoke the world into existence can bring can make every word that he ever promised come to pass how can you fret when that's the revelation when he gives you when that holy ghost seals you in and he whispers those love secrets to you and tells you you were with me before the foundation of the world how can you miss it you can't miss it because the word was already spoken it has to be done he'll perform a paradox he will bend space and time and matter around you to make his word come to pass how do i know that because heaven space and earth matter heaven and earth will pass away but his word will not pass away hallelujah he's spoken that word to you it will come to pass said the hebrew children how now how would you make the science oh i'll go up one paragraph here so that's why abraham staggered not of the promise of god through unbelief but was fully persuaded that he was able to perform and to keep that what he said he would do he staggered not at the promise of god being a hundred years old and sarah 90 to have this baby because that he know that god could perform and make have a paradox to happen on something he knowed that god could have a paradox a miracle to take place and he did it how many of you know god can perform miracles he's performing miracles right now he is transforming you by the power of his word right now you don't see it it's little by little just like the caterpillar it all i i and forgive me i know there's a lot of people get a lot of discrepancies on this but i couldn't help but think of a little tent vision with that little room and those people going in their maim and halt and blinded and they come out completely whole it just made me think of that caterpillar because i thought that caterpillar goes in there all grubby and wormy looking and looking all terrible but he comes out a beautiful butterfly and what did he say he said i'll meet you in there he said no one will know anything about it and that's the secret hidden place that hidden life in christ that our prophet preached on hidden life you could only know it by being born into it it has to be that way because it's sealed away from the rest of the world and it's only revealed unto his own that's the fellowship of the mystery that's why you can't you can't truly have fellowship with with a not with someone that isn't filled with the holy ghost you can't because that fellowship doesn't go to that level that's why i it even goes to me it was almost a deeper understanding brother branham used it as a joke but that the brother said what's fellowship he said two fellows in one ship that's the truth those two fellows have to be in the same ship have to be sealed into the same body in order to have fellowship you can't have it any other way they actually have to be in the same place that's why you can meet a brother a brother or sister a believer from across the world and there's a connection there's a we sing that song there is a connection to the other side there is a connection to jesus christ you can't put your finger on it but it's there just the same oh i love it he'll perform a paradox to make his word come to pass he oh i love he did it for mary a paradox the first invitro ever done god placed a word seed in there and brought a baby out a baby jesus brought it out a paradox before science ever figured out how to do it and even better than that he didn't even need mary's egg to do it [Music] hallelujah the lord's been the lord's been baffling science since the beginning and i love it i i enjoy science you know i say that it's just a natural i i enjoy i think it's fascinating to see even molecules and how you know these this wood is actually mostly empty space according to science all the space in between the molecule i think they said if you took an atom and blew it up to the size of the planet or something like the the size of the earth they said the nucleus would be the size of a grain of sand in the middle and then the electrons would be so far away they'd be to the moon and yet we can stand on that and god's word is further than that because that'll pass away but his word will never fail i love it but i i get almost zealous and jealous for my god when these scientists can pump their chests out and act there is no god we can prove this and prove that and their evolutionary insanity and all these different things they claim evolution and yet they said the point of evolution was to procreate a species right survival of the fittest now i'm just going somewhere with this for a second but i i just got to say it they said they said oh survival of the fitness darwin said that dog that can tolerate a colder temperature might do better because it'll breed and have another one that can do it and they can live in that climate so they said the purpose of all evolution is always to produce the species so we're evoluting higher and higher supposedly and now we find ourselves devolving to the point where they rejoice in not being able to procreate the species so what is it they rejoice in their unholy unions where they can't even produce natural life anymore and they claim that that's evolution it shows insanity but i get so jealous for my god when they try to puff themselves up and say oh there is no god oh i know he's there i met him can't take that away from me i met him on the back side of the desert i know he's real you can't take any that's why brother brown said the devil can't tell me ain't real just trying to tell me you didn't love me but science they don't even know what they're talking about when you come to if they had a moment of honesty they tell you we really don't know what's going on because every time they learn more they realize almost everything they knew was wrong i mean i i'd still joke with people about it in a sense with nutrition next year eggs are going to kill you again last year they're the only thing that's going to save you 20 years ago they were going to kill you 10 years before that is the only thing that was going to build the muscles but science goes back and forth every day don't eat the egg because the cholesterol you got to eat the egg because you need healthy fats you don't want the egg because you're going to die and people build their existence on that let's build our existence upon the word of god whether you it doesn't matter if you can understand it or not it's a it may be a mystery to you where he's leading you all the time but remember he's alpha and omega he's beginning in the end who he has justified he's already glorified i don't care how he gets me there i said i i i prayed this when the lord revealed this message to me now lord have mercy almost almost 20 years ago i'm getting older i said lord i don't care what it takes i don't care if i understand it i want to make a rapture i want to live for you i want to i want to see your life expressed and i believe that's the prayer of every believer here this morning it doesn't matter if you understand it or not those disciples didn't understand they didn't understand the word and he walked with them for three and a half years but when the time came see he was fulfilling the word the whole time they didn't know it you know you know that you're fulfilling the word many times and you don't even know it because it's been sealed and hidden away from you i believe in the book of job it even says he said that god will actually implant instructions in the dreams of man that's just a little tidbit that i always found really interesting i always wondered why deja vu was a thing and the lord kind of showed me that scripture i said well praise the lord i praise the lord when i get i don't know if you've ever had that they call deja vu it's like i've been here before i say praise the lord i must be walking the path i must be where he wanted me i've been here before you know praise the lord and so is everyone and i i believe when that rapture happens and we're up at the wedding supper i believe i'm going to look at brother man i said brother manasseh we were here before the foundation of the world brother it's all becoming clear now i see him face to face we shall see him as he is because we'll be like him amen amen just a little bit more reading we're still pretty early here it's not even noon yet i hope that's okay just a little bit here trying to trying to start the slow down early so we can actually get it done properly because i know once you get inspired you just kind of go and we're trying to try to be mindful of these things see now the hebrew children now would now how would you make science believe today that man could go into a furnace i love the way brother braham says he says oh i would be afraid to say how many fahrenheit's hot it was but could go into that furnace back there in the book of daniel and stay in that furnace until they thought he they was all burnt down to ashes which every man the great army of soldiers great husky man that moved out there to throw them in the furnace those men that went in there perished by the intense heat of the furnace against them and they fell into the furnace and was down in there for all this time and come out without even the smell of fire on them god performing a miracle that was a genuine paradox of the keeping power of god against any enemy when a man is ready to admit god is true and god keeps his word and honors those who believe in him certainly i believe in a paradox and you become a paradox to the world brother branham also says in that message he says he says you become a paradox to yourself things that happen you become a paradox when god takes someone who was steeped in sin steeped in the ways of the world and completely transforms you to love the things of god that's a paradox that's a paradox now just a little bit more here if that's okay i hope i hope this is all right this is from christ is the mystery of god revealed it says get the revelation brother this generation spurning god's revelation see false prophets are doing that by their fruits you shall know them they are hybrid they are bred into an organization instead of the word of god the revelation of god revealing himself through christ who is the word oh my see that's the only way he can reveal himself is through jesus christ and the only way he can do that now is through christ in you because christ the the the physical manifestation of jesus christ is not here according to that body but he is in you and that's why it's the paradox that god would manifest these things through a body of flesh if you could die to yourself i believe that's we're going to get you down here but he says if you could just die to yourself if you could just separate yourself from all the things of the world you'll become that paradox sealed away with god because then once you pushed away all the flesh then the spirit can move but he can't move when that flesh is there to block it because that holy ghost is a gentleman he doesn't just force himself i said we could stop here he said but if get again when we come back if you want to he said now there's okay he says you want to go ahead that's up to you congregation says amen all right just a little i'll hurry but take time enough that you've got some time to rest after this all right now notice the predestinated seed the holy ghost alone shows you who he is no prophets or his kings and here god is manifested in the flesh here is the fullness he completely revealed and made known to the world oh my look on mount transfiguration when the testimony of god himself this is my beloved son hear ye him there stood moses representing the law there stood elijah representing the prophets but he they passed away and he said this is my beloved son hear ye him there was three represented there the law the prophets moses and christ he said this is him god fully not manifested in prophets not manifested by law but manifested in christ he is christ has mercy the law put you in jail but couldn't get you out the prophets is god's justice to condemn you and kill you for it that's right but jesus was god's love and revelation to let you know to a predestinated seed that he called you this is him hear him no the fullness of godhead is made known now is made known this secret of mystery is now revealed that god is manifested god and man become one the anointed man christ what does christ mean the anointed one the anointed that was anointed with the fullness of the godhead bodily oh my how can people doubt it where once partly moses had him partly david had oh my but here he is manifested in the fullness deity himself standing on earth god in his fullness to die for the sin of the people that he might bring to his church a sanctified life that he might at the preeminence in fullness in his church to manifest manifest every promise in these last days that he promised for the last days so what has he sealed us away for he sealed it in you to manifest every promise that he's promised in this last day through you he says listen now are you i'd like now just pinch yourself a little now see watch what was jesus manifested for listen to this listen very closely it says what was jesus manifested for to show god he was god he had to be no man could die no prophet could die he was god he was the god of the prophets he was the prophets he was the kings he was the history he was he that was to come he that was he that is and that's to be in this day the same yesterday today and forever he was manifested for that purpose and through that purpose he achieved a church that he the fullness of god might bring to pass every promised word of god in these last days now here's where it gets down to how is he going to do it when he gets the preeminence in the church the position his place in the church when we put jesus christ in the right place in the church jesus said he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he also even more than this shall he do for i go to my father see that was his purpose there was the manifestation and now today he wants to get somebody that can so see it that they can let the word see jesus so seen it so was so perfectly born for the day until god expressed every move that he made he was god's revelation god revealed now what is he if he wanted that from his son what does he want from his sons and daughters he wants us to be so in line in tune with the word until every move is a manifestation of that word everything that we do and say is a manifestation of it that's a sealing away brothers and sisters that's a locked away with christ that's a complete prisoner now he's sanctified with his spirit and blood a church that he might make every promise in this last day be revealed now see he could go back and pick up what these others other fellows have left off here in the last days and by his holy spirit reveal all the mystery of the seventh seal see he is expressing himself that's his purpose that's why he died that's the second fold of his threefold manifestation first to express himself in christ then to express himself through the church and the same thing christ was the word and the church becomes the word when it lets the word go through them see you've been you've been turned into a sealed book and the only thing that can be sealed inside is the word that's that's all that can be sealed inside there is the word god is not going to let he's not going to coexist with the world that's why he said if you love the word of the things of the world the love of god is even in you because god won't share the throne with anybody he will not share the throne of your heart with anything and it's time that we put god first you're gonna look crazy to the world you're you're a sealed up thing but don't you worry about it even if you can't see what's happening in your life that word is working on you you just keep eating you just keep sealed away with god shut in with god in a secret place there in the spirit beholding his face gaining new power to run in the race that's where you gain the power it's to be shut in with him they that wade upon the lord shall renew their strength if you feel weak shut in with god get sealed back away remember just many of us sometimes we feel so far away from god but maybe we've just grieved that dove away just for a season brother branham said he'd just fly over on the other branch because he's timid the the holy ghost can't dwell with dirty things they just can't do it but if you just clean it up maybe rededicate yourself as we'd all stand we'll have the musicians come maybe it's time we just each one of us maybe just rededicated ourselves to him say lord seal me away lord make me a mystery to the world i want the world to be a mystery to me i want to be ignorant to the devices of the world i don't want to i don't want to partake of their ideas and their thoughts and their mannerisms and the way they live their lives i want them to be a mystery to me lord make me a mystery to them seal me away with the word lord make me part of you a deeper revelation a deeper walk a deeper love a deeper manifestation that's what he's longing for before for his church brother ram said it right there he said he said if you could give god the preeminences what does that mean the first place the number one spot if you have preeminence it means everything else steps aside and lets him go through let him have the preeminence and he'll see you'll see a paradox begin to work god will start transforming your life in ways you won't even understand how it's going naturally but the spirit man will rejoice you'll have that it'll be that fellowship of a mystery that you can share one with another words can't express it of how much you love the lord jesus of what he's done for you truly but you could just say lord i'm not what i want to be and i'm not what i ought to be but i know i'm not what i used to be and if there's just that even little spark inside of you that's desiring more of god he's not done with you he's not finished with you this bride's moving up you know what he saw it in the vision we see the stumblings going on even now where that bride looked like she was starting to get out of step but there was a voice that said get back in line so if there's a voice to do that if there's a call from god for us to get back in line then he's got a wave he's got a way made for us to get where we need to be and i tell you what it's going to be a paradox some of you look at your lives you look in the mirror of the word and you look at your life say lord i don't see a way but you know what he makes a way where there is no way i believe when the the brother had that testimony he said you believed god so much he said yeah what if god told you to jump through that wall he said you know what either god's gonna make a way for me to get through it or he's gonna transport me to the other side [Music] but if he told me to do it he's gonna make a way and i don't know about you but i just know for me i can only testify he told me i'm gonna make a rapture he gave me the holy ghost he filled me with his spirit for a purpose to manifest what did he say he said what was the purpose of jesus to express god to the world that's your purpose is to express jesus christ to the world jesus was a mystery to those people there even the one that's believed it he was a mystery for a time so don't don't get discouraged if your family members that you're that you're praying for and you're battling for and and just struggling saying lord i need a breakthrough nobody seems to get it don't you worry that seal is going to break for them that revelation is going to come why because he promised it he promised him let's just bow our heads heavenly father lord lord we just rejoice in the finished work of calvary lord that the works were finished from before the foundation of the world lord we've entered into that rest lord lord you said there was a promise of entering to the rest and lord we've entered into that rest lord if there be any here that has not entered into that rest oh god may you just let them not sleep day or night lord until it manifests in their life lord until there's a revelation made until they meet you on the backside of the desert face to face where lord they're just sealed away into the kingdom of god and the shekinah glory just stands there that pillar of fire lord your very spirit lord that would dwell amongst your people and it with them lord you said that you would dwell with your people lord god lord but many times maybe lord we've just come to a place where maybe we've let the little bits of the world creep in here and there lord we've gotten worn out sometimes as the scripture says the devil's trying to wear us out but lord we just want to do everything we can do to stand and be dressed with the full armor of god to know lord that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of god would raise up a standard against it lord we're standing now in this age lord we're standing upon your word and upon your promises not claiming lord that we can understand all things or understand all the mysteries but the one thing i do understand lord and i believe all the believers here understand is that you're faithful lord that your word is true that you made us a promise that you'll bring to pass lord lord because it's your word and you won't let it fall to the ground lord for each one that may be struggling or suffering and lord we all have our different needs that we're in need of lord we're a needy people lord i so much had that song on my heart lord it's it's me it's me it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer lord so many times it's so easy to see the faults in others lord or the world around us to see the the wrong that's there but lord may we lord you scripture says that you desire truth on the inward parts lord may we look inside ourselves now and give you the preeminence lord give your word the preeminence in every aspect of our life every little corner lord of our hearts may just shine the light of your gospel lord clean out every cobweb clean out every dark corner shine the light into every every crack and crevice lord that you'd make the hidden things known lord lord and we'll be quick to repent lord we'll be quick to give it all back to you lord jesus we'll be quick to surrender it all to you lord lord if lord i just pray lord if there be anybody here that needs a touch from you they could just raise their hands and say lord it's me o lord standing in the need of prayer lord i want to lord maybe i don't understand everything lord i'm a mystery sometimes even to myself but lord i believe your word i want to be like abraham lord i want to be like joseph who just could only trust in what you'd shown him and what you told him lord and that's all we can do is we believe you lord lord and if there's anything that's hindering us lord may you reveal it lord may you seal us away into your kingdom lord lord if we've grieved your holy ghost from our lives in any way lord where you that dove is just sitting on a branch away lord may we just cleanse all the filth out lord may there be a revival lord in our hearts every day lord to get all the trash out lord that your holy ghost would come and manifest yourself in our lives that there wouldn't be any barrier no hindrance nothing between my soul and my savior oh lord my hands are up lord may you just lord cleanse us lord from all unrighteousness lord seal us away lord break us down lord whether whatever it needs to be broken down lord that you could transform us into the image of your son jesus christ lord that when he comes that character that you desire would be in us lord it's even in us even now and even growing lord that seed that you placed in us lord the light of the gospel of this hour shown upon it it's growing lord may you just fertilize it lord with the with the water the word lord just feed it [Music] and help it to grow lord let us just lay in the sun and absorb it lord and just rest in you lord jesus and give you all the preeminence lord we give you all the glory and honor lord may just minister to your people and find them at the place of their need right now lord lord you know where each one of your people is at and you can meet them right there lord lord for all the ones that are traveling week once again lord just pray traveling mercies lord may you just strengthen our pastor lord strengthen brother billy and as they minister your word as they empty themselves out may you just give them a double portion to refill them again to get back on the firing line lord lord for our brother matthew as he's preparing himself to minister this evening lord and he's given himself out to even lead songs this morning may he just bless him lord with an anointing lord to get out of the way and let the word of god flow lord we look forward lord to meet you in the air [Music] lord when all the things that we've been longing for lord we can't even describe it in our words our mortal tongues aren't even enough to lord to express the longing that we have to to be with you lord and to cast off this body of flesh lord but lord we know that your promises are sure your word is everlasting and ever true and can never fail and lord we're standing upon that we're standing upon that right now lord we commit it to you we thank you lord in the name of jesus christ we pray amen let's just sing that song as our brother matthew would come [Music] jesus let's feel [Music] me [Music] jesus [Music] that's fear with love praise the lord the fellowship of his mystery amen god's given us a great promise and he's called the bride to manifest his word in the end time maybe you feel like you've been hearing it over and over and over maybe you feel a little bit like sarah we're going to have a son we're going to have a son we're going to manifest the promise we're going to go in a body change uh uh oh you'll be there for perfect even as your heavenly father is perfect and you feel like you've been believing and believing and believing you're starting to wonder lord how am i ever going to manifest these things how is it ever going to happen in my life and you get discouraged and and you see your faults and your failures and as time keeps going on and you start to wonder within yourself lord is it ever going to happen am i even called is it even going to be through me uh where even sarah was like well take hagar maybe it's going to be this way maybe i'm just foolish virgin no no you're the predestinated elected chosen bride of jesus christ that he has foreordained you to manifest the word of the hour how do you know when it's going to happen well maybe maybe you've been believing so long and you started to wonder is it way off down the road how am i going to receive the strength don't don't you wonder that sometimes how am i ever going to restreet receive the strength how am i ever going to receive the faith to manifest the word that's been spoken in the end time well how are you going to receive the strength how are you going to receive the faith it was contained in the mystery of those seven seals the scripture says that sarah received strength to conceive so what happened there just before the promised son arrived there came melchizedek melchizedek came walking by and came by their way and what did he ask abraham where's thy wife sarah and he performed the sign of the messiah discerning the thoughts and intents of the hearts and what did that do that sparked a change in abraham and sarah to bring forth the promised son and whatever we received oh who is this melchizedek who is it that came and revealed the seven seals what was the purpose of that was to bring a rapturing faith to the bride and as we're feeding upon that word even as our brothers point out right now you're being changed you have now entered into the rapture cycle the change of your body is actually happening right now oh i imagine that abraham and sarah as as melchizedek went on and now he said according to the time of life you shall have a son well maybe they didn't feel any different right then maybe the next day it sounded like abraham said the same exact thing sarah do you feel any different no no i i don't i don't feel any different but according to his word he said according to the time of life and the bride is now in that same cycle according to the promised word how is it going to happen oh like brother randy said i don't know but he promised it one step at a time just keep feeding on that word because any moment in a twinkling of an eye the seal is going to break our bodies are going to be changed and we'll enter into that full expression of that theophany body forever to be with our lord amen hallelujah just good to be in his presence amen let's just sing that uh song in dismissal what a beautiful name amen the key of g would be fine you were the word at the beginning [Music] oh
