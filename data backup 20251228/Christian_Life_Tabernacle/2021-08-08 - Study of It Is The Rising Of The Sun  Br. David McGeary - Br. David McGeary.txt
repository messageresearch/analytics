we can stand we're not falling apart and amen we can certainly thank him for that i know that uh many of our folks are down in louisiana attending the memorial service so we certainly want to remember them this morning we welcome all our visitors amen buddha michael mccandy and family certainly glad to have you with us and all of you that are visiting god bless you this morning as you invite by the mic for us so i'm reading amen good morning yeah you know we just got back from a couple weeks out in the mountains of colorado it's um it's hard not to sit there and see these massive mountains and these huge forests and these great waterfalls and come up and not think of the glorious majesty of his creation you know of how his mighty hand has created such huge wonderful things and you sit there and you you know when you look at all the enormity of that you know you can feel a little bit like a speck you know and it occurred to me we look at psalm 8 this morning i think david maybe felt very very much the same at least at some point in his life but certainly when he penned to this scripture it says very familiar to us it says in verse 3 when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him you know and no you can't feel any more that way but when you're sitting in front of his glorious creation and seeing that you know certainly the scripture came through my mind i'm sure many of us in this room have had a similar experience where you looked at some beautiful thing that the lord had created and said boy what is man that thou art mindful of him but you know as i was kind of reading that and thinking about that another verse popped into my mind which kind of caught my attention and it's verse 6. it says this thou madeest him man to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou has put all things under his feet amen how many of you have sat there looking at a 14 000 foot mountain with all those forests and waterfalls in the wildlife and said he's given me dominion over that i admit that i haven't thought that very often until i started looking at the scripture and it caused me to look at his creation in a brand new light you know it's easy to say amen when you say look at the beautiful creation that he's created what a wonderful and glorious and majestic thing he's done but it's another thing entirely to say amen when you look at the same thing and say he's given us dominion over that it says thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands you know as i thought about that another scripture popped into my mind it's in matthew 21 when jesus was speaking to his disciples it says in 21 18 now in the morning as he returned into the city he hungered and when he saw a fig tree in the way he came to it and found nothing there on but leaves only and said unto it let no fruit grow on the hence forward forever and presently the fig tree withered away and when the disciples saw it they marveled saying how soon is the fig tree withered away jesus answered and said unto them verily i say unto you if ye have faith and doubt not ye shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree but also if ye shall say unto this mountain fourteen thousand feet tall be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea it shall be done you know perhaps we need to be reminded as we look at these things that sure the beauty of his creation is something that certainly demonstrates his glory and his power and his majesty but maybe we need to be reminded that that's an example of the physical realm which a people have been called commanded to have dominion over what is man that thou art mindful of him you know the whole world is all caught up concerned about things like climate change deforestation pandemics let me tell you what was not so from the beginning it says in romans 8 here's what's happening the physical realm is missing its master it says in romans 8 19 for the earnest expectation of the create creature creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god for the creature creation was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in hope because the creature creation itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god for we know the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain together until now it says in verse six thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands if somebody could allow themselves to submit to submit themselves entirely to thus saith the lord there is nothing in the physical realm that would be beyond his control we are each spiritual creatures that have been placed in a physical realm for us to take dominion over and fulfill genesis 1 28. and psalm 8 6 remind us as of that thou hast put all things under his feet so i don't know if that was a blessing to you but to me it certainly changed things as i was looking at fourteen thousand foot mountains forests and waterfalls and herds of elk and these types of things there's a position that we've been called to to master the physical realm that we've been put into if we can submit ourselves fully to thus saith the lord so it certainly caused me to look at things in a different light there and maybe that you know that'd be a blessing to you and a good reminder but let's read that together in psalm 8. it's just a short chapter it should be familiar to us starting in verse 1 o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth who has set thy glory above the heavens out of the mouth of babes and sucklings has thou ordained strength because of thine enemies that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger when i consider thy heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained what is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou visitest him for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with glory and honor thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou has put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen yea and the beasts of the field the fowl of the air and the fish of the sea and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas o lord our lord how excellent is thy name in all the earth amen amen god bless you may have your seats amen we serve a wonderful god amen there's no one there's no one like jesus oh there's no one there's no one like him [Music] oh there's no one there's no one like jesus oh there's no one oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh there's no one there's no one like me [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] oh [Music] me [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] this morning [Music] victories is [Music] today [Applause] will have to bleed oh is [Music] oh is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] is oh oh [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] i amen aren't you glad we have the victory in him hallelujah we thank him for that amen amen this morning we just uh let's say there's uh many that are attending the memorial service in louisiana to just uh uh be a part and to comfort and to be with brother tim and the church we certainly want to continue to remember them i pray that god will comfort them for days to come surely not this is not an easy task to certainly pray that the lord is a great comforter he'll be with them amen also brother donnie and his church i believe they've been affected again with covert and there's so many people affected there and i want to pray that god will deliver them you know the scripture says many are the affliction of the righteous but the lord delivered him of all of it he'll pray that god will be with him and certainly healed all of them and man when i remember sister leslie i believe she flying so she flew to california to be with brother david's mom and pray that god will be with her we'll pray for brother david that god will [Music] keep him in just a couple of days until sister leslie comes he can certainly be with him and [Music] amen amen if you have a need upon your heart this morning amen just leave your hand to him amen we gather in his presence nothing is impossible to them not believe amen the brothers that are taking the offerings if you could come this morning amen but tommy if he could just come and take this before the lord [Music] let's just go before the lord oh dear heavenly father lord as your bride is calling out this morning with many needs lord lord as the loss of a loved one has moved on to glory lord lord we're not we're not saddened lord we're mourning of course because she's not here with us no more lord but we're celebrating her in glory lord

right here on my knees soon i'll soar like [Music] of grace [Music] i can always see god's face rising in his splendor to [Music] you i may face things tomorrow i can comprehend today circumstances is so uncertain to find the strength to praise in his promises [Music] high on wings of grace [Music] sometimes it takes them out [Music] to get a hold of me [Music] like an ego high on wings of grace [Music] rising in his splendor to heights i never knew what was like a mountains just a hill from heaven's point of view [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen amen it makes a difference to get heaven's point of view amen amen [Music] you unravel me with a melody oh and you surround me with a song full of deliverance from my enemies oh and till all my fears are gone [Music] [Music] oh [Music] you

[Music] let us pray our heavenly lord our hearts are heavy like the believers throughout the country this day is they're honoring the life of our sister who has gone on to be with you or [Music] a labor in the ministry alongside of her husband father she's gone to receive her reward and as the brothers have already prayed we just ask that your blessings be there father's much suffering throughout the land and [Music] turbulent times and the scripture said there shall come perilous times lord and we recognize that the face of this world is rapidly changing and lord we need to change also so we're asking for your help this morning and blessing us and helping us being with us father [Music] we know that you have the power and the strength and the life and we're needy of it we ask you to bless us this morning we pray in your precious and wonderful name jesus name we pray amen amen god bless you may be seated this morning i talked with brother nathan bryant this morning he sends us greetings to the church we certainly want to pass that along to you i kind of was wondering about how i wanted to approach this this morning so i thought that i'm done i i don't know i think i really think they have a revelation that i'm going to sing a special but we'll do it thank you so much everybody for playing i noticed we got some rails up i guess that's good that's good i don't know who did that but that's wonderful so thank you very much i enjoyed that special this morning our friends visiting with us god richly bless you this morning in each one we have a lot out there's a lot going on i know i think school starting up pretty quick and people are wrapping up their vacations and and those things but uh all we can do is keep going on day by day right as you know like as the church changes you know people come they go they pass on they're born but we know that there's a great eternal goal that we're all going to reach one of these days uh we were talking here the other day about uh how things have changed so much in the last couple years when as many have referred to it as a plague struck our country all of a sudden people had a routine of life a way they did things the way they thought they had expectations of what they expected and what they thought would come and what would happen and all of a sudden in the instant of just a few months time people weren't going to work kids weren't going to school um everything was locked down and shut down our freedoms were snatched up from us and then all kinds of uh information and voices and things were coming out and people were citing and taking sides and opinions on things there was a a physical turmoil there was a great uh political turmoil uh just a lot of things and so it's very difficult not to have all these things affect you you know what i'm saying uh people became very discontent and they were discontent with everything and so uh but the one thing that we know is is that god's word doesn't change and so that's why that i just feel that the lord put on our heart to take the message of the hour and to go through it you know step by step and just feed on it and so we're going to start this morning and probably for the next several weeks ministering from this message it is the rising of the sun and i was taken back even by the title of the sermon um i want to talk a little bit for the next few minutes before we listen of how in my heart that i chose to approach this message and even the title is a signal to us of how to approach something or what to look for or you know or or what what is the the terminology that they use and key in on something and it says it is the rising of the sun you know uh uh someone said to the to me the other days are you looking to listen to uh this is and i thought this is no it doesn't say this is it says it is and so we when we're going to start listening brother rem starts this tape out in a very unusual way if i could say that he starts out by talking about the opening of the seven seals and about the sword coming into his hand and about the great witness of all the phenomena that had taken place to make this uh this word what it is and as as i was just praying about it and we were riding down the road the other day on our way to the visitation and to the gravesite service billy and i and brother cosman we were listening to the first part of this message and it struck me and i i set out to the brothers i said did you ever wonder why he started the tape this way and as you notice it's the the picture of the uh uh cloud that we have here and the church ages and the things that have that is the thing that has seemed to raise up the biggest question about the validity of the message and i thought isn't it strange that he's going to start preaching a sermon this is the rising of the sun not past tense but present tense in other words something is rising now there's a rising of the sun going on now but he so he and he stops steps back and he says the cloud this that appeared and the seven angels that went up and how they caught a picture of it and and and i thought you know this is the thing that everybody can't a grasp is because they try to make a timeline you if you understand they try to say this event happens and this event happens but if this and i i believe this comes out in this message in a very beautiful way but when if something's eternal you understand it already is there's no timeline because everything is already in existence you you understand what i'm saying now you were in existence is that right you were in the thoughts of god before the foundation of the world isn't that what he said you shouted for joy the sons of god shouted for joy so you were already eternal in existence there was there's no so when did you when did you happen now you want to put it in the timeline of your life i i was born in october 27 1949 which is no longer my birthday it's now evan's birthday but that's all right but so we always look at things like in a calendar timeline this has to happen before this has to happen and this caps to happen but if you can stand back and realize the whole thing was already in existence from beginning to end i'm alpha i'm omega i'm the beginning i'm the ann so it's it's like a canvas and and it's been painted on and then man walks up with the uh a magnifying glass and wants to know which stroke was here first because you ever notice the painter will paint something and then he'll come back over and paint over it again and he'll come back over and he'll paint over it again and maybe he'll go over the whole canvas and keep going back painting and painting and adding and adding until it comes into full manifestation to your eye but when the first stroke was laid down what was in his mind was in the first row so when when the you know that's why that song was so beautiful to me he says from heaven's point of view it's just a hill and so in other words when the lord looked down at it he knew when adam would come he knew when moses would come he they were already in existence we're the one that makes the timeline we're the one that said oh the angels went up here and he was here and he was over here and and uh this is over here and somebody was in houston and and i i can't it was all in existence already it's eternal all this was already here because with god if it's spoken it's finished it doesn't matter if the angels so when the lord looked down he saw him he knew he was going to send the angels he knew he was going to give the vision it's it it's we're trying to take the puzzle and put the pieces together in a timeline but it didn't for god it's the whole painting it's the whole thing it's already in existence do you believe you have a place prepared for you do you believe there's a body waiting for you it's already what it's already there it's already finished the timeline was just given to us because the scripture says the kingdom of god is within you that you can't know the beginning or the end of it you can't comprehend it we are what's called straight line thinkers we can't we can't understand two things happening simultaneously can you imagine philip trying to explain how he was just here an hour ago the timeline don't work but it does an eternity okay so there's a just to me there was a great reason why that he started out this way because he's trying to bring to us the effect the understanding that there is a resurrection and a rising of the sun happening now it's not the timeline event that this happened 2000 years ago so he'll go into a portion of this message where he talks about memorial he says to everybody else around easter is a memorial it's a memorial no matter how you celebrate it whether you celebrate it with easter bunnies or or all those things that's not what matters the point of the theme is is that it's a memorial and a memorial looks back in memory of something that happened so it's looking back as a as a memory so they're remembering that the lord rose from the dead they're remembering to that to that the s-o-n came out of the grave so it's in the form of of of a of a remembrance but what what is magnificent in what he's trying to express to us there is also now in this generation a rising of the sun and as we listen to this he will go through a small portion this morning where he talks about when the sun that rose up in the beginning of creation the first sunrise when there was the very first natural sun came upon the earth it brought forth the seed life is that right now all this was laid in here in beautiful type what happened to the church seed it went into the ground so there had to be a rising of uh the sun to bring that seed that was in the ground to life so it's not the resurrection of memorial looking back when jesus rose and brought life and so the difference between this sermon in one aspect and the message the easter seal the easter seal brother branham talks uh quite a bit about the quickening power he will also in this message but it is what that that resurrection brought back to the church the power that it brought back now remember this this uh great power or this great quickening power that came upon the church it it produced something and so we talked a little bit about this i'd like to read this statement we'll hear it just a moment satan doesn't care how religious you are now religion is the memorial that's all religions are all religions are in memory of what that he's done remember man's always talking about what he done and that's what they wanted to do let us build three temples let us let us lay a memorial here for what happened when they crossed the jordan river they took 12 stones and they laid it there as a memorial to remember but this is not bringing this is trying to bring us past remembering press acknowledging what that he's done and what that he's done for us by paying the price for our sins at calvary we are beneficiaries of that now but what he's trying to bring our understanding to is what is happening now what is what is transpiring so we don't want to look back in the light of a memorial let's remember this let's remember this so i get up this morning and i preach let's remember that he died on the cross let's remember that he gave the baptism of the holy spirit let's remember these things let's look at what's already uh been purchased for us but this is a church that is rising so we're it's not what we want to remember and hold on to what we remember but it's like what is what is transpiring now what is god doing with me now what what's taking place within me now because i believe we're all changing our desires are changing our appetites are changing the what that we're searching for in life is changing uh people it's a time that man will run to and fro because they're hungry is it here is it there like i i can't find the satisfaction that i want to find very good maybe if i do this maybe if i do that and that's all right that's all right but he wants to reveal to us what he's doing so we can understand what's happening to us then we can understand how can i how can i be a christian for so many years and all of a sudden find myself in these hardships how could i be raised the way that i'm raised and then still find such weakness because there's something that's got to transpire that's got to happen so this is what he said so all religion is a memorial it's man remembering and doing something to honor the memory the catholic priest dressed up in all these robes and puts on hats and throws incense and lights candles it's all in memory but what he's doing is slips by he says so this is paragraph 30 when we get to it satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good or how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you've been born again now so and we know from the easter seal what the seal of being born again was was a quickening power now this life is not a manufactured life [Music] okay it's a life that's given took all the religion in the world will not give you or create that gift it it's a gift that's given god gives the life to the seed so all the seed was laying there in creation right but what had to happen was the sun had to rise and it was the sun striking just like the apple seed every apple the tree the every apple that tree's ever going to produce is in that seed but something has to move upon that seed in order for that seed to come into the process and that's what he said he said he would hold up a scene he said oh look at my apple orchard now in a man's point of view it ain't an apple orchard but from god's point of view it is an apple orchard because it was created and planned to produce this orchard so if you're trying to find a timeline someone will say oh don't call don't call it this yet because it it's not here and this happened here and that happened there and and and they're just all over the place poor poor people very good so this life is given now in the easter seal the prophet of god explained what that life was he explained like what that life did he explain that you had to have it right but in this is the rising of the sun he's explaining to the church how they're going to get it what has to happen there has to be a rising of a sun there has to be a light that shines out over the seed to bring it to life it's got to have it's got its part but it'll never be so command can't start that resurrection in them by memorial they can't start the resurrection in them by study or or by theology there's got to be something that happens in order for it to come to life no matter how much it's the crying to come to life and the other seeds i want to come to life i want to break out of this ground i want to come up but the plan of god says that the light has got to come across it amen and god chose away he said there is a man here that can turn on the light there's a ministry here that will be the light there there's a the the coming of the son of man this resurrection this light has come to shine upon the seed you can take this bible all you want but god ordained that the ministry of malachi 4 5 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 that this spirit this voice this word had to shine [Music] on the seed you can't bypass it because the very life the deity of god which is the creator of life and the bringer of life dwelt and was failed in that flesh the word that's folk life it was inexistent and as we listen this he'll you we'll see even though we're going to be chopping this up is that you'll see how he talks about the sun that came up and what it did to the natural scene he's all leading to the understanding of really what this message is to us and why it's so important that we don't depart from it a lot of people want to take the the teachings the benefits and leave the vessel the light didn't shine through any other vessel [Applause] and you can't separate the messenger from the message you want to take the message and then you want to say this it's the message that the light amen no no it's the evidence that the life was in the vessel and put on display that gives it its validity isn't that what he said the real proof is is that he does what it says it would do that's the real seal of it so how can we talk about the quickening power if the quickening power wasn't manifested in the flesh how could we talk about the resurrection if the resurrection wasn't manufactured in the flesh and that's what he brings up there's been a lot of good men that have gone on before but there's only one that proved the resurrection was true [Applause] and there's only one way that the seed can come to life it's to have the sunlight of the word amen go across it not secondhand you know they have what they call grow lamps and hot hot hat i don't know i've had hot house tomatoes and then i had a friend of mine bring me some tomatoes out of his garden man alive almost like tomatoes i mean unbelievable so this is a life that's quit given the quickening power is a life that's given it has a source it has a place that it comes from it comes from the word of god not second hand but straight from the sword and so this is the the approach that we're as we listen to this and we go through it we want to be understanding that he's he's laying out the types of the of the first resurrection he's laying out the types of the first coming up in seed coming to life in creation and then he's talking about the quickening power that that that came and was given to the first church and now he's coming back into it because god always manifests in three she's coming back to now there is a rising of a son that's going out over the seed of god and bringing it to life so never substitute religion or turn this house or any other house that you would attend into a memorial talking about what's happened the sun s-u-n sticks with the seed all the way through to maturity this s-o-n that brought the word of god didn't place it in the realms of memorial but it's still a shining light staying with the seed all the way to maturity so it's not academia [Music] that's why to me the voice is still so important and you mark my words you mark them strong people are moving away from the continual maturing of the voice and they're moving towards emotion and and feeling and and manifestation as if the voice has been spoken it's a finished work and now it's our turn to take it and run with what god's given i don't believe that i believe that that voice is still speaking to the seed it's still maturing the seed it's still bringing it to life and it's right there is the way that god provided and you can't break it off you got to stay with it all the way to resurrection and rapture all the way i'm going all the way i'm going to listen to it play it to me on my deathbed i still believe in it i still believe it's working it had to shine it had to be created it had to be spoken it had to be recorded but it didn't finish it's still working and so as we listen to this this first 20 minutes this morning and i'll close here i want to read a couple of statements just this this is further on in the message probably a week or so or two away he said and the s-o-n has got to be be revealed again in the bride in the last day the quickening power has to come and quicken them out of these dead denominations in creed to a living word of a living god no it quicken them to new life it does the same thing for us now notice they were so quickened in that quickening power it he says the quickening power wasn't only in their souls it was all over them amen so we see that that quickening power had come he makes this statement he said he said and he's talking about the little boy rolling with the fisherman he said sit down son sit down the old fisherman quiet you know him knowed what he was talking about said just wait until the s-u-n comes up then we can see where we're at you say must i be a methodist a baptist a pentecostal just wait the s-o-n comes up we'll see where we're at he is the word wait till you see the word manifesting shining across the seed the wave sheath will see where we're at do you love them amen i hope as we go through this that it can come back to our remembrance even though it's been 50 years and time dilutes things time changes the story look at how many denominations we've got look at how many things we got it changes the story it changes things but and time dilutes it but we've got record you understand we have something that can still shine and still mature and and you know that's i i i i i share with you what i believe because you have a right to the of your choice of leadership and i think any minister that's honest up to share with this congregation what he believes not using the the step phrases of the message of the hour to create a feeling but exactly what i believe that's why i play tapes that's why i do it because i know that that voice is the s-o-n in this resurrection this seed that brings the light to the soul it's what god provided and i understand if there's a place that there's no uh ability to listen that god's grace and mercy can do a multitude of things but that's not so with us you know it's not so with us i believe that i don't believe there's another move of god i believe the last move of the church is the seed ripening in the word ripening in the sun coming to maturity god working all those things out in your life individually taking the things out that shouldn't be there to maturing giving you strength to fight off the bugs that you don't need to be petted and hybrid that it comes to that time where you've got to plant your roots in god's word and you've got to be drawn and you've got to grow and you've got to say i need to produce the fruits i need to manifest what i am lord give to me what i have need of is come down to such a a place where the bride has made herself ready and you can't get ready he'll refer to it i don't know if we'll get to it in this portion of the tape but he refers to us simply he says that the people today in the gospel of the world church he says they're preaching fiction a good fiction writer is someone that can make it seem real but you can't leave out the rising of the sun so as we start in this first 20 minutes our messenger is going to start laying the foundation the comparing of the sun in creation to the sun that comes up in our day the quickening power the bringing of the seed he's beginning to lay the foundation for what that he's telling the world that they've rejected and aren't you glad you're elect amen you'll enjoy this next portion so god bless you i hope you join in this study with us and with me that you'll get your uh sermons and you'll read through it and go back over at each section at a time that you'll pray as we go forward we'll probably have visiting ministers in between our study and we'll preach some evangelism but our focus in the next few months is to just really take a good look at this rising of the sun so if i i don't know all that we have for our people that don't speak our language i don't know what if this tape's available in spanish if you can look out on your phone in spanish you can look on it in french you're welcome to take your device i'm saying this so i would have never said this you know because but you can take your your your uh device the trouble with most devices or nothing but vice but they left the d out of it but uh and read along with it and so just watch the progression how he talks about the seals how he talks about this how he talks about the first resurrection how he talks about the son how he's beginning to lay the foundation to the revelation he wants to give the church so what we're going to do is he's when he gets to the scriptural scripture reading if we you'll just stand for the scriptural reading and at the end of the scripture reading we'll take our seats god bless you as the brothers play as we gather here this fine easter morning see the little bugs pressing they're way out the seas flying in and getting their potions the birds singing like their hearts with bursts with joy because there is an easter egg we believe that you raised up jesus from the dead many years ago today and we celebrate this memorial day and let there come an easter among us all today may we as disturbance understand his word that we are in his fellowship then and that now that we are risen with him and setting together in heavenly places bless the service here in the tabernacle and across the lands where it goes by this telephone heal all the sick and afflicted may it be an easter for them also and an exodus from sickness onto strength and those who are dead in sin and trespass may they live today through christ amen and we'll praise thee for we ask it in his name amen i certainly deem this a marvelous privilege this morning to be back here in jeffersonville indiana with this great congregation the church packed and standing and around and outside and in the lot and ever worried to you people on the phones across the nation the beautiful morning here five o'clock this morning my little friend with a red breast flew up at the window and woke me up seemed like his little heart was bursting he is risen always thought that this little bird is being a friend to me because i like him as the legend about him says the little brown bird saw him suffering on the cross for sin and placing of course the little bird had no sin he didn't have to die for the little bird but he flew into the cross and tried to pull the nails out with his little beak and he got his breast all red and that's the way i want mine too as this shield of trying to protect this glorious thing that he died for realizing that our time is limited here especially for those friends who are listening in by this telephone i would like to call your attention this morning to a a picture at some time a goal was taken by the camera of a vision that i had here at the tabernacle of leaving indiana to arizona where i was to meet in a form of a pyramid seven angels not knowing what would happen later when i got there thinking it was the end of my life but no one could stand the blast and i'm sure all of you are acquainted with the story and then in sabinia canyon one morning like this while in prayer there had been a sword placed in my hand and said this is the word and the sword of the word later the angels appeared as was prophesied and at the same time a great cluster of light left where i was standing and moved 30 miles high in the air and around the circle like the wings of the angels and drawed into the skies the shape of a pyramid in the same constellation of angels that appeared science took the picture all the way from mexico as it moved from northern arizona or the holy spirit said it would be standing 40 miles northeast of tucson and it went into the air and life magazine packed the pictures a mystic something way in the spheres where there could be no moisture where there can be no evaporations of anything 30 miles high and 27 miles across and coming right up from where those angels were now they asked to know science the one of them in tucson wanted to know any significance but i didn't tell them you all knew it told beforehand but it wasn't for them it was for you and so there he spoke to me and said the seven seals will be open the seven mystery seven-fold mystery of the bible has been closed up since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared with all the world we've enjoyed these blessings now hearing those mysteries marriage divorce serpent scenes all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself let's open those seven mysteries of what the church was how it was in christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last day and now as this went up we have the picture outside on the plaque but then i have the picture laying present here if you notice as life magazine had it but i wonder if my audience visible here has ever really looked at the picture and the way it should be you remember i was preaching when this vision came upon the subject of the book of the revelations were the old judges where we seen jesus in revelations 1 when we started to open the seven seals of the or the church ages rather just prior to the opening of the seventh seal christ was standing with hair like wool white and i described that to you that the old english judges and judges of long ago when they went to the bench to be sworn in their supreme authority was given them they wore a white wig as it was over their heads to show their supreme authority well if you'll turn the picture like this and look you probably see it in the audience it's christ see his eyes looking here just as perfect as it could be wearing the white wig of supreme deity and judge of all heavens and earth can you see his eyes nose his mouth just turned the picture from this way they had it this way the way it's supposed to be and can you see it amen [Music] he is supreme judge there's none other but him and that is a perfect identification again a vindication this message is the truth it's true and making him not a third person but the only person with the white so you see the darkness faces beard in his eyes and notice he's looking from him comes this light shining on the right hand side to which he's looking to and on the cross that's where he looked to the right or he pardoned the sinner and the blight of his resurrection we still go forth in his name i wish this morning that i had just much time to stand upon these phenomenas that's beyond any shadow of doubt been proven for the past 30 years the 35 years right here at this church that's down on the river when that same light came down here in jeffersonville in 1933 and spoke those words as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of christ you're a message before run the second we're at the end time and we see it we wonder sometimes why it hasn't spread over the earth maybe sometime we'll have a chance to explain that as god willing now i want you to turn in in your bibles as we always believe that the word must come first of the reading of the word i always read that because if my words is the word of a man it will fail but the word of god can never fail now we're going to to read from the holy scriptures a text and we want you to turn first uh to um three places in the bible that i have chosen to read from one of them is in revelation the first chapter and the 17th and 18th verse this is where he appeared with his hair white as wool his feet was like brass and then i want you also to get in your bibles romans 8 11. i've chosen this morning three places to read from the holy scriptures for my message today as the lord is placed upon my heart for the resurrection and then i want you to also mark 16 1 and two there i will draw my my context now in revelations 1 18 we read these words 17 and 18. and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not or i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of death and hell and in romans the 8th chapter and the 11th verse we read this but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and now in mark the 16th chapter the chapter of the resurrection the 16th chapter the first and second verses and when the sabbath was passed mary magdalena the mother and mary the mother of gene and salome has brought sweet spices that they might come and anoint him and very early in the morning the first day of the week they came unto the sepulcher at the rising of the sun now my text this morning i want to take for a text it is the rising of the sun and for a subject i want to use the quickening power now you know you perhaps have been hearing the radio and the different ministers speak in our noble brother neville this morning speaking his easter subject on the resurrection and i thought maybe i would take it a a little different path not to be different but just to add a little more maybe in another angle or you the scriptures every angle you go with the scriptures it always declares jesus christ you cannot get away from it anyway it always declares him now as the world today in a a memorial service or at least in the united states and this side of the earth this morning and the churches and throughout uh celebrating a memorial of the greatest triumph that man ever had i think as savior when he died or as an infant when he was born he could not abandon your less being coming into the earth and when he died certainly he atoned for our sins but yet there's been many fine little babies born and there's been many man who has suffered and died for a real cause but there never was one that could raise yourself up again until this day now that it is the greatest week in history the greatest celebration of all times this easter is where he proved what he had said man can say things but yet it isn't exactly can be believed upon thoroughly until it's been proved to be the truth and it's god who said prove all things hold faith to that which is good he would not tell you to do something that he would not do himself so he proved who this was that died for our sins and now not only is it a memorial day of all these great easter flowers and easter bonnets and pink rabbits and so forth that we've got into and holy celebrations which is all right but this is not the real thing and that way as people today are trying to say we should wash feet once the year on on uh thursday and on friday we should take the communion and all different doctrines that they argue about where they should be this day or that day or what should be a sabbath day or the first day of the week or all these things are just merely tradition what good would any of it do you whether you had lent or not limp if there's no life in you it's only a memorial which is nothing against it but they have certainly carried out their traditions but left off the main thing satan doesn't care how religious you are or how right you are in your doctrine if you miss that life your won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it doesn't matter one thing unless you have been born again therefore if god raised up jesus from the dead did he raise him up for a memorial and is this resurrection morning only uh uh one day in the year or a certain day that we celebrate this are are we benefactors of his resurrection amen what does it mean to me what does it mean to you not we believe by faith that he raised from the dead but what has that got to do with me that was 2 000 years ago now to find this text as i was tired my arm hurting me from shots the nurse gave me for leave overseas now as you know in a few days and um but had these shots son and i and with collary yellow fever and everything i was pretty weary making me sick which seizure requires to have these shots before you go into the other nation and he said give caesar that which is caesar but then give god that which is god and as i was sitting there wondering what would i speak to this waiting audience this morning which i'm very thankful for and men and women who would lay their life on the line for what you would say how should i do it what should i take for a text and then while i was sitting there almost asleep my door rattled uh out on the front side of the house nobody being there but myself as far as i knew i listened i didn't get it just right after a while the den room door where i have turned into my study it rattled and someone kept shaking the door i went to the door and opened the door and to my surprise a pretty little yellow-haired blue-eyed girl stood there uh looked like a little easter flower is sitting here looking at me now she handed me a card and it was the uh of course i guess when i get home they'll be easter cards and so forth but the only one being leaving home that i'd received and she said brother branham this is from daddy and me she want to be sure that me was in it and her arthritic father sitting in a wheelchair had sent this card when i took it and thanked the little darling as she turned and walked away from the door i opened up the card and in the farm of this card i drew my text for on the card was the saint mark 16 1 and 2 sun up the sun was rising and then i thought of that and then the subject of the quickening of jesus christ to be raised up from the dead through my subjects now the sun at the rising of the sun well there was a time when the world was laying in utter darkness it was without song and it was void and it was all covered with water and was laying there in this dark dismal gloomy atmosphere and the spirit of god moved up on that water and said let there be light god had a reason to do that for down beneath that water there was seeds that he had planted and it had to have that sunlight to make it live and the first light was ever given in the earth was god's spoken word the first light that ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light amen and there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy and life upon the earth then the spirit of god as it moved with love and compassion at that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the earth the sun rose and swept across its rays and dried up the waters from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for its first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed that was a great hour but oh it wasn't nothing that's southern high like the sunrise on that easter morning this time with the sun leaping into the skies it brought forth a greater sunrise than ever because it came greater news with this sunrise than it did with the sunrise at the beginning this sunrise brought a news that he is risen he is quickened from the dead as he's promised he's risen from the dead the first time the sun rose in genesis it was bringing a message that there will be life upon the earth mortal life but this time when the sun rose there was a a dual sun rising another sun rising it was a not only s-u-n rising it was the s-o-n had risen to bring eternal life to all god's promises that before knowledge he'd seen laying upon the earth no more could the the botany life live back there at the beginning without the sun to bring it to life no more than today when sons of god is up on the earth it takes a s-o-n life to bring down to eternal life his chosen ones that he knew before the foundation of the world he had chosen them in himself before the foundation of the world on easter morning then in this dirt somewhere laid our bodies at that time for we are the dust of the earth and in heaven there was a book of memory and his attributes was in him knowing that they're called this son of god raised it would also raise the life every sun that was foreordained to this great time he knew it would be and what a more glorious sunrise that was than it was at the beginning at times when it first dawned now on this great breaking of the easter sea you'll just have to come back or go home and listen to the rest of it over and over again just in closing let's just run back over just the last few quotations and now the sun at that rising of the sun well there was eight times paragraph 37 there was a time when the world was lying in utter darkness how many times have you heard the expression we are in total darkness the world's in total darkness the the spiritual type you know see we don't think we're in darkness because science keeps testifying of their knowledge and their light in their technology but you're in darkness if you don't have the revelation of eternal life and a life after this he says the world light in utter darkness so that's a type it was without form and the world was laid in utter darkness without form it was and void and it was covered with water and was laying there in darkness dismal gloomy okay aren't we blind miserable poor wretched naked and don't know it atmosphere and believe me ladiosa is an atmosphere you know what i mean and this atmosphere uh is uh uh has in such an effect you know that's what i'm personally going through now i'm so dissatisfied with the way that i feel the way that i think the the the spirit that's in me i want to break out of that influence of it the influence of all these things and i know there's only one thing that can break me out of that is that hearing that voice of life just get me through it's just a time that i have to go through but i i know that there's great overcoming it says dismal gloomy and the spirit of god moved upon the waters and said let there be light god had a reason to do that okay so now we understand we're going forward in this message he has a reason for sending light okay and and this is the reason that he says he had a reason to do that for down beneath the water or water awful represents what people multitudes of people okay so down amongst all the people and remember earlier he told us he said i'm going to explain to you why it didn't spread worldwide because it was only for the what elect so he says down beneath that water there was seed that he had planted when did he plant it okay that's right before the foundation of the world and it had to have that sunlight to make it live okay so you're starting to see how he's just pressing this out there and the first light that ever was given on the earth with god's spoken word and the first light ever struck the earth was god's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turned darkness into light in order to bring forth a creation of joy life upon the earth than the spirit of god as it moved with love and compassion in the great day the first day of of dawn of creation on the earth the sun rose and swept across its rays dried up the water from the earth and made an atmosphere above and for this for the first time it was to bring joy and life to the earth by a seed isn't that strange that he put it there the joy in the life that was brought to the atmosphere into the earth came from the seed that was planted the flowers that everything that came forth that was a great hour but it was nothing like the sunrise at the easter morning right we so we read that and everything rope up in the skies and we wreak he says the first time the sun rose in genesis it was to bring a message that there was life upon the earth mortal life now this time there's a second message right that there's eternal life well the third time this message is what he's coming he's here there's a union he's here to unite with you to become one with you to quicken you and place in you the very thing that's going to change your mortal body the quickening power that's why i read the scripture if the same life that dwelt in you dwelt in jesus christ it will also quicken so now picture this sun rising okay so eternal life was now united back with man every debt was taken eternal life he sent his spirit and now this the seed goes into the ground now here comes this light in our day right he's testifying of the light he's testifying of the eternal life the the the world is groping in darkness but now here comes another light shining proving that he's the same yesterday today and forever proving that he's coming again and not only the sign of his coming that we're at the end time but now he's becoming benefactors of it and he's imparting back the original not a fictional not a man-made you understand so if the original had to come from the light which the first light was the spoken word the second has to come from the spoken word and that's what he was he was the what that word that spoke it made flat and now that word's got to come in us that we have that same quickening power that was able to speak it into existence now it's able to take us to where that we're going it's just laid out there in just beautiful types and in closing uh it's just 12 o'clock we did pretty good so i'm not going to read too much more because i'll get excited but maybe you could put this paragraph up there paragraph 12 and uh and let's stand together and that way it'll help me make sure that did you see it unfold i mean could you see that how he brought about that resurrection how he brought back how he brought the things in what he's moving towards i don't know if that was the right way to approach it this morning but i just i just felt he says listen to twelve and so there he spoke to me and said the seven seals will be opened the seven mysteries the seven-fold mysteries of the bible that's been closed up since the foundation of the world why is that important isn't that almost him describing what the rising of the sun is in our day the light that was going to come to take away the darkness and put the resurrection quickening power the seed is in us but it's got to be brought to life wouldn't that what he just said the sun's got to bring the seed to light he said unfold the seven mystery that's been closed since the foundation of the world will be revealed and we yet a humble little group compared to all the world we've enjoyed the blessings a hearing of those mysteries marriage and divorce serpency in all these different questions has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself all church it would take forever and i don't have the words to explain it the razor thin edge between the deity that dwelt in brother branham and the flesh you know the veil and uh but it's it's almost inseparable but he says the church he says has been completely revealed to us not by man but by god himself that's opened those seven mysteries of what the church was we could certainly talk about what the church was right and how it was in christ at the beginning isn't it beautiful what we've begun to see that we were with him in the beginning our names were written on the lamb's book of life we were in his thoughts that that that came to you because of the rising of the light in the rising of a sun in this day everybody else groping in darkness well there hope a hope that they might but now it's been real revealed to us that we're already sitting with him in heavenly places in christ jesus make it personal to yourself it's not that hard to explain okay some of you that are in school i guess they can teach algebra in sixth grade or something now or something you've got college degrees you've got education you can sit back and look at this very simple event and can say what the prophet is what does that mean to me what's it got to do with me that was a long time ago what does that have to do with me today this is the answer to that question how it was in christ of what the church was and how it was in christ at the beginning and how it would be revealed in the last days how it would be revealed how would this church seed elect be revealed in this last day the son of man ministry would rise up veiled in flesh and shine this light back over the people quickening the seed in them bringing them to life to what they were planted for oh emmanuel isn't he wonderful then it's just bow our
