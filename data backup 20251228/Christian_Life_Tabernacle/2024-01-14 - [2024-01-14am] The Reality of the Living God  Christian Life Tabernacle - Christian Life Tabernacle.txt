just want to open our service and prayer I'll just ask brother Jud to come uh before we do that I just want to read a praise report that uh sister Liz Parks has turned in for Brother Gary she says my dad Brother Gary stanky was struggling with his lungs for the last few years they found that he had some spots on the bottom part of his lungs for the last three years he's been getting scans every three months to watch the spots they made it hard for him to breathe deep and catch his breath this past Tuesday he went for scans and a doctor visit uh for his lungs he this past Tuesday he went for his scan and doctor visit his lungs are clear and the doctor told him to come back in six months all right God is so faithful why don't you just praise the Lord for that I love it when the outcome would be much different if it wasn't for the grace of God we could be reading a a prayer request instead of a praise report but keep continue to remember him in prayer and as we go through this service think of the needs that are represented our body uh Brother Gary has has seen God intervene on his behalf time and time again and this is just uh one more praise report we're so thankful that

to see him they told us he pass away oh lord it's not like we have Merit father it's just by your grace and we are here this morning for that Grace father and we want to thank you Father it's not like we are more than other the people that there struggling father in the Sin oh God we could be in that place father but you choose us that why we are here father we don't know how father oh Lord but it was by your grace we want to just humbly come to you this morning to say father one more time father one more time you want to come close to you like never before father to see you oh God to walk with you God to listen to you father to follow you father how can a man follow you you are God father if you don't take a part of you and you put in the man it's impossible for the man to follow you oh God because we are like animal with out the spirit of God in us father we need that guidance this morning Father the holy spirit in amen father making us father your follower father that why they call

want to commit the service from the beginning to the end oh God just come down father speak to us we commit the service in your hand in Jesus name we pray amen father amen you may be seated morning tell you what it's a good thing it's not cold or it would be really miserable wouldn't it amen by comparison we have a family member in Canada and it was minus 31 there yesterday yesterday so it could be worse you know this week you know we've been making all of our beginning of the year' been having all those beginning of the year kickoff meetings at work if you have ever worked in Corporate America you know exactly what I'm talking about it's a something companies do all over the world the calendar page turns and all of a sudden All Things become new you know there's new programs and new initiatives and new goals and you know knew everything nothing changed except the date and you know I always ask you know if there was a better way of doing things if we should have been doing something different why did we wait why not do it October why wait till January 1 you know one of the new things we launched this year was uh an effort to build a new culture at the company and as part of this they've launched a a program to teach thousands of people how to be different how to change you know how to behave differently how to interact differently how to respond to pressure differently how to do everything differently think differently and uh so we're running thousands of people through this program because we want them to be different we want a different atmosphere and we want on a different culture it's a 12-week program training and workshops all this type of thing to transform people into something new you know to somehow make old people new that they've been behaving one way all their lives and suddenly in 12 weeks of training we're going to teach them how to be different kind of people you know yet with this huge program and it is exhausting not one mention not one consideration for the transforming one you know the one who truly can make all things new you know if you want a different culture you get someone in front of the pillar of fire one time and one night with the King can do what 12 weeks of PR training and programming cannot be ye therefore transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God but no we have a program for doing it we know what it takes to get this done so we're going to run everybody through our program without even considering the presence of the Lord and I thought about that as I was reading Psalm 14 this week we're going to read that today David said in verse two the Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is no n that doeth good no not one not a single desire or acknowledgement or attempt to seek the face of the transforming one because they've got a program they' got a method they they've got this all they got a thing they do to do this thing you know the people of this world certainly we should not be surprised when they do this because until you've known him you know there isn't even a desire or an appetite to seek him but I was thinking as I read that you know how often do I get so caught up in my thing you know my ways how I get things done my the way I work the way I do things my methods my preferences my habits that I fail to recognize his presence you know and I'm not talking about getting caught up necessarily in sinful things and I'm not talking about the presence of the Lord in the service church service I'm talking about the presence of the Lord in our individual daily lives because I'm so set on my ways I have a way for doing things I have a habit that I you do with my day there's a certain method to the way that I work that I fail to even consider his presence you know brother brandham spoke of this in a message called the presence of God unrecognized where he spoke of being in such a condition it's your ways Traditions your habits God can be near and we won't acknowledge his presence because it doesn't line up with how we work even a message believer and brother brandham said this now when he is not recognized his power is always not revealed when he is not recognized no matter how much God Is Standing present you've got to believe it that's all we miss out how many times do we miss out every day on the option of leveraging him because we don't consider his presence when we're going through our daily thing what if he wanted us to do something just a little bit different David goes on in verse four have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the Lord you know I thought as I was reading that you know iniquity is doing our own thing it's when we know what to do but we prefer to do something different because it's easier it's comfortable or whatever the case may be and you know my prayer is Lord don't let me be like that you know help me to be sensitive to his presence in my daily life and pause just enough pause just enough to recognize his presence rather than go about it the way that I usually do you know but something else caught my attention as I was reading this they he made that statement eating up my people as they eat bread you know this can happen to us as even as his people if we're not careful that we get so consumed so occupied with the drum beat of life and with how we work and with how we respond and with our habits and our preferences that you know we can often get caught not recognizing his presence until we come back to church you know and I'm not talking about getting caught up in sinful things I'm talking about being so utterly consumed so busy so occupied that the only time we recognize his presence is when we walk through that door we should bring his presence with us not come here to be reminded of it you know I was reminded of the children of Israel who when they first came to Egypt and Joseph was presenting them to Pharaoh he dealt with how they communicated their occupation he said when you talk to Pharaoh tell them what your occupation is it's to to be a Shepherd to take care of the sheep that was their occupation but somehow between that space of time and what we read in Exodus their focus shifted well rather than their occupation being about the business of the sheep it became about building treasure cities for Pharaoh they forgot they got caught up in another occupation and you know they even got to the point where they believed their survival was based on their ability to build Pharaoh's treasure cities but their occupation had been Shepherds you know and finally it took a time where they began to seek again for the presence of the Lord and then God came on the scene as we know you know but his people have a purpose there's work there to be about and if we're not careful we can be utterly occupied by the drum beat of life and be consumed eaten up with the our activities of life you know there are a couple of other statements that David makes here in the psalm as we get ready to read it he says that there is one thing about these people says in verse 5 there were they in great fear for God is in the generation of the righteous you know all those daily things that can be occupation forces nevertheless God is in his people you know and as I got to thinking about that more you read late further on in the psalm it says that in verse 6 the Lord is their refuge and I was reminded of the statement that Jesus made if I abide in you and ye abide in me ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you you know if we can continue to abide and not get dis and recognize his presence and not get occupied by the drum beat of our thing there's nothing we can't ask in fact go to verse seven he wraps up with this statement oh that the salvation of Israel would come out of Zion you know I was was thinking about that and you know if we can just stay tuned to his presence his desire is that his people actually become his presence in the earth so rather than it being about us trying to remember and recognize his presence in our daily lives we come to such a place that we become his presence on the earth what a contrast you know and and this has happened before once there was one who appeared in a fiery furnace and a Godless King looked at him and said you know what that's what a Son of God looks like you know and John said that you know Jesus said that uh or the scriptures say that he was the firstborn of many Brethren you know in John 1 says that as many as believed him to them gave he power to become the sons of God but then one John later says now are we the sons of God and we know this that when he shall appear how many believe he has appeared we shall be like him and we know also from the scripture that all creation is groaning and travailing waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the presence of God on the earth let's stand this morning and you know as we read the psalm you know my prayer is that I don't fail to recognize his presence each day not just in church not just when there's a service and the music is playing or the minister is preaching but in my daily thing am I acknowledging his presence recognizing his presence and not getting occupied by the occupation forces so that I can be his presence in the earth let's read that Psalm 14 together it's just a short Psalm the fool hath said in his heart there is no God they are corrupt they have done abominable works there is none that doeth good the Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God they are all gone aside they are all together become filthy there is none that doeth good know not one have all the workers of in it no knowledge who eat up my people as they eat bread and call not upon the Lord there were they in great fear for God is in the generation of the righteous you have shamed the counsel of the poor because the Lord is his Refuge oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion when the Lord bringeth back the Captivity of his people Jacob shall rejoice and Israel shall be glad amen praise the Lord you may have your seats I want to sing that song my my my what a joy it is it's cold outside what about in your heart I think the important thing is if it's cold in

from your throne that's the desires of our hearts we we've sang songs and we've done what we could now we invite you that you be the guest of honor in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we ask this things amen amen it's good to be in the house of God Amen you know certainly happy to have break the cold to be here you know I woke up this morning I almost changed the title of my message you know I was going to call it the uh winter breathing Christians the kind that God is looking for amen but I realize that would be too obvious amen let's open our Bibles and um in Romans chapter one just a short scripture reading let's start from verse eight it says first I thank I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all that says that your faith is spoken throughout the whole worlden don't you want your faith to be spoken of you amen when they hear of your faith they know that those are those that are standing on God's word it said that for God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his son that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers I said Romans chapter one and I'm reading from verse 10 right now it says making request if by any means now at length that I might have the prosperous journey by the will of God to come unto you for I long to see you that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift to the end to the end that ye may be established that is that I may be comforted that that I may be comforted together with you by the mutual Faith both you and me it says now that I would I would not have you ignorant Brethren that often time our purpose to come unto you you but was led here to that I may I might have some fruits among you also even among other Gentiles it says I am a dead both of the of the Greeks and of the babarian and both of the wise and the unwise so as much as I'm in as much as I'm in as is in me is I am ready to preach the gospel unto you that I at that are at Rome also for I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believe it says to the Jews first and also to the Greek for wherein it is righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith as it is written the the the the just shall live by faith amen let's also turn uh John chapter 17 we're just going to read one or two verses there John chapter 17 and we're going to read verse uh one two and three says these words spake Jesus and and and lifted up his eyes in heaven and said father the hour is coming glorify thy son that thy son Also may glorify thee as thou had given him Power Over All Flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as thou had given him so that's what the the son is asking for it says and this is eternal life that they may Know Thee the only true God God and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent father we ask you bless the word to us this morning we commit it to you in the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen you may have your seats this morning I want to just for a few moment this morning uh speak on just something that has been on my heart and you know you you you sit and you listen to a pastor preach and you as a and I believe this goes along as all of us not necessarily just as ministers but you you really try to capture sure where his mind is at and and what God is dealing with him at because really you you when you hear the word of God you you try to really see what is God trying to tell us what is God trying to encourage Us in and I want to just for uh this morning to give it a title I want to speak on the reality of the Living God and the reality of the Living God my my my heart not necessarily my mind um I believe brother Matthew used this scripture about the woman at the well in John 4 um and and I was just meditating on it I went back home and I sat and I was looking at it and and and I just began to to dwell on it and just let the word speak to my heart and and and I thought I remember places where the Prophet will speak and we know that most of what he would say or some of the things that he would say that these were things that were ministered to him by angels and and I I say that because it's important the message that we have received it's not William bram's interpretation of what the Bible is it's not some man sitting somewhere and taking his Bible and taking the concordance or taking a a by a study Bible and putting it together and presenting to and say that this is what I think this means no but some of the things we hear come out of his mouth were directly T to him by an Angel and he's only repeating the word of an Angel to you and in fact I want to say this not just some of the things but the entire message of the hour it's not a man trying to interpret what God Said but it's God himself speaking to you speaking to this generation and and why is he do that because God wants to communicate to you what his desire is at the end time because God is here calling his sons and his daughter and he wants to give you a word that will bring a change in your life and and we can say this morning and I was I was thinking about it as you we sit here th this is not a mind of man being given to another man so we can come in fellowship with what we're thinking but the word of the end time was given so that it would produce a quality bride that Jesus Christ himself was looking for and I want to say this to to get to where I'm going uh I if someone was to tell me this morning that hey uh you know brother Matthew has got a gift for you and and I will say oh but Matthew's got a gift for me and I will hear about it I'll be excited I'll be happy oh P Matthew's got a gift for me oh yeah that's wonderful but there's going to come a time where I need to go and breed ber Matthew myself and get the gift that he has for me and I'm speaking about the reality of a living God there there's going to come a time where just hearing that brother Matthew has a gift for me will no longer satisfy it there was going to come a time where I I could hear it but yet yet there's something missing between what I'm hearing and the reality itself so I got to move from just hearing what brother Matthew has for me into moving where what brother Matthew has for me and me we become one and and that's where our hearts has to be because the devil is there to Buffet us every moment the devil is here to try to make us church members he's just trying to make us satisfied we reading our Bibles and I said well I read the Bible and I read the message yeah that's good and and I say that's wonderful but don't just stop there let the owner of the word that you are reading in let him take that word and make it a reality in your life the reality of the Living God there's a person who spoke the word that you're reading it's not someone it didn't come from the sky someone spoke it so you got to find out who spoke this word words who is it that wrote this word who is the author of the word that I'm reading in and I want to meet him for myself we we cannot be satisfied with just hearing the hearing and the doing has to come together and it's not for you to bring it he's the one who brings it together but it's for us to hunger for it you know I was thinking you know if my my kids if I ever promise them something I'm in trouble you know we'll come to church and you know we'll say well you know after church and you know I I'll get you guys a hamburger or something oh my goodness I don't even think they will hear any me anything that was preaching a sermon they they will be there and just waiting in anticipation and you know I because I'm the last one to get in the car when I get in the car if there's a complete silence I know something is going on why because it's the only time that they come together and they can work together any at the time they're fighting so the moment I say something they come together and they wait in anticipation the moment I get in the car they remind me of my promise oh if we can come together as children of God if we can put our fights on the side and if we can come together this morning as one and and say God you promis in your word you said you will do this and you will do that God will make his word reality God and His word are not two separate things and the problem is the problem is people take the text and they give their own interpretation and their own understanding they don't follow what the author wants and what he wanted to do with his word what we need is to take his word right back to himself and let him make it a reality to us not be satisfied with some kind of interpretation and we we've taken men and put them between God and us and and every time we read and we go back to that man what is this mean what he no God don't want that kind of relationship he wants a relationship where he can speak to you directly from his own word and as Believers of this message we we can come here this morning and said this message promises God will give us good health this message promises we'll have a body change this message promises that will be the perfect Bride of the end time this message promises that the works that Jesus did we shall do also this message is the only thing that promis that is been sent to make a bride ready so therefore if I partake of this message my expectation is the owner of the message will come and make me what he promised he will do I expect nothing less but that don't be satisfied with men's understanding within her like ask for God to make his word a reality in your life you said you a Healer and I'm sick I'm not going anywhere I'm standing on your word I'm going to call upon your name day and night I'll be like that woman in front of the church until he gets tired of me I'll stand there until his word is a very reality that's how the Saints of the Old Testament lived they didn't take any man's word for it our pastor preacher a moment ago they didn't have a Bible they didn't have anything but the moment the word was inspired to them they stay there until God made it a reality no but we hop here we hop over there and we'll he here and then someone will come and give a different interpretation well when Jesus said a mountain it was not really a mountain really if Jesus said a mountain it's a mountain now the mountain could be whatever is in your life whatever mountain is going but it didn't mean it wasn't a mountain it was whatever obstacle stands before you and the word of God let God come and remove the obstacle oh my something that can match what was spoken with what I'm seeing in my life that's the reality I'm looking for amen God bless you the musician come no I'm just kidding I'm going to get cornered there by the deacons before so I was as I said I was thinking about the scripture in ch in John chapter 4 and I'll just try to take my time and don't worry about the clock we'll stop whenever we feel is enough and and the goal is not to finish up everything it's just to say something that's of benefit that we can take before we leave so the scripture would say if you could put it up in John chapter 4 it says therefore when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus made Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John it says though Jesus himself did not baptize but his disciples he left Judea and departed again into Galilee but he needed to go through Samaria he needs to go to Samaria and I say Lord come this morning by my way I I have a need of you that you know God has never forgotten any of his believing children God has never forgotten his Plan of Redemption it doesn't matter what condition you are in if there's a heart cry within you God will come by your way the the the the very word of God and let me just say this before I can continue we we often time need to work and I'll say this many times as I move we need to work on our relationship with the word of God because you you cannot just every time you pick up the word of God when you read all you see is condemnation and and law and God telling you do this and don't do that or do this or don't no that's the wrong kind of relationship if you see it that way pray that God will help you because it's more than that it it the word of God is life the word of God is the only life you can ever have the word of God is s to save you from yourself the word of God is given to help you God has never sent his word to his children to destroy them the word every time he sent is to take you out of sin out of whatever condition you find yourself in and bring you into the fold of God so if you view the word of God as condemnation ask for God to help you this morning he may come with instructions he may come and rebuke you of something but the end goal is to save you the end goal is to do you good is not to forsake you so he as he speaks in the word he says I have need to go to Samaria so his heart's desire was perhaps they saw a vision of this woman who had a need and and he knew that he was send to the lordship of Israel he doesn't come for those that think they've got it all together he doesn't come for those that think they don't need him but he comes to those that know I have need of him this morning and our attitude towards the word has to be of Lord we need more of you than we ever had it before I I say this I woke up this morning and and in my hearts I just began to realize Lord I need more of your spirit like I never needed it before you you can never have enough of the Holy Spirit you can never have enough of God we we always constantly need him and and need him to come and live within us and so the scripture will say and he came to a city of Samaria which is called Saar near the plot of ground that Jacob had given to his son Joseph it says now Jacob's Well was there and Jesus therefore therefore he says being wearied from his journey D he said set dust by the well and it was about a six hour it says that a woman came to drw water Jesus said to her give me to give me a drink for his disciple had gone away into the city to buy food it says the woman of Samaria said to him it says how be it how it says how be it you being a Jew asked a drink from me a Samaritan woman the Jews have no dealing with Samaritan now we we understand if we read through history the the reason being that the the the Samaritan were a mixed group of people when when I believe it was Nebuchadnezzar when they took the Jews when they when they came and he took what they would do is they will take all the young men out of the country and they will leave only the old people and what they will do is they will disperse them so they can completely forget about the culture and everything and we'll take them and try to mix them so that the whole race is gone they will remember nothing of what they were so the Jews had this against the Samaritan because they were mixed people so here he is the word of God is speaking to her all she's looking at is the existing conflict within her life the word of God is come and speaking directly through her yes he is she's looking at the word through the prism of where she comes from oh I can't take this this cannot be for me I can't accept this what you're saying is against the law and what it's against the nature it's against what has been she she has some precedence within her own mind of why she cannot act the way that Jesus is asking her the word comes and says oh God is here to make you holy oh I cannot be made holy because I've been the file from where I come from the word is calling and saying oh come and do this and we we have some preconceived ideas within our mind well it it cannot it can only be this way it cannot be that way but Jesus is here speaking to you and yet ourselves being caught up with what history is and then Jesus answer unto her it says oh if th knew the gift of God and who is it that says to you give give me a drink he says you would have asked me and I would have given it I would have given you the Living Water so now Jesus is wanting her to understand oh I love this because he he didn't cast her out he didn't go he was so patient with her now remember Pam told us that yes Jesus is trying to contact her spirit the word is Supernatural the word is spiritual but yes he is taking everything carnal uh uh expressing or always viewing everything that's being spoken through the carnal lenses the word is trying to contact the spirit she's rejecting it why because of all the carnality that has taken place oh I wonder how many times we do that but if you knew the gift of God what is the gift of God the gift of God is it doesn't matter what was God can make a new thing what is the gift of God it doesn't matter how much sin you find yourself in this morning the word of God has the power to change your situation you know the devil is the master in twisting our lives and getting us in circumstances we don't understand he will take your life and put you in so much trouble you're like well in the situation I'm in God can't accept me but the word is here it says oh if you only knew the gift of God huj the gift of God is he can take you and wash you clean the gift of God is the blood of Jesus Christ is the most powerful thing that exists it doesn't matter where you've been it in let me say this and and hour from an hour before now it doesn't matter in the presence of God the second that just went by it doesn't matter before God what matters is what you do now you accept the word God is able to bring it a reality to you oh I did this and I done that and I've been caught up in this and and what is just speaking it says forget about all of that if you only knew the gift of God to try to see God as the new thing when when when we approach to to to see the gift of God to understand the gift of God is is to understand that it doesn't matter what the past has told you it doesn't matter what my circumstance is this morning I I don't rely I don't take the past to determine the future I like the word of God determine what my future is going to be I take what God has said to direct my life I take the promise of God in order to direct him to let him direct my life the gift of God stands by your own self it's not to be mixed with anything it's not to be mixed with what you wear what you could have been it's only stand by its own self and it's only based upon the promise that he has made to you the woman said unto him sir you have nothing to draw on she still doesn't get it she's saying you have nothing to draw and and the well is deep he says where then do you get this living water are you greater than our father Jacob who gave us this well and drank from it himself as well as his sons and his Liv and his livestocks so yeah the word is being spoken she's caught up in the formula in the calculation well there's the well if this man says he's going to give me water he has to have a bucket he has to have some type of of rope he has to have a way to go down deep this well and get the water he's not talking about the natural water he's not talking about what you think it's not talking about what your process of life is let me say this I I was so moved as I was just the scripture was just opening to my heart I I began to think about the message that I'm preach let me just take this for a second I thought I was not going to sweat but I guess I just can't overcome that I was telling the deacons I need a sweatband and and a headband so I could just I'll be probably be the first preacher to do that so yeah I was thinking about butam speaks about testimony on the sea I want you to think these disciples they're sitting there and the they're talking about what Jesus had done in those things and one of them speaks about how he takes the fish and the bread and he begins to break it now he asked he said oh he said how did they do that does that mean that God has some offen in heaven and and that they will bake bread quickly and as he as it will cause the brain to fall down and he will distribute it he says no God is a Creator now I want you to the natural process that we go through is for mankind it's not for God the the principle of understanding that before you can touch water you have to have a bucket you have to have all of that that's what men do but God is Not So we cannot H God to men's standard so when when he speaks now he's trying to get it to understand so he says no God is a Creator he says when he takes that bread and he breaks off a piece off of it God being a Creator he bypasses the whole process he creates another piece right back to what was before why because he has the power to do that she's completely oblivious she's she doesn't understand in who pres she's standing y he is speaking of spiritual things she's taking it all in in the cornal mind and look until that time Jesus is still patient with her why because he knows he's been sent to help her and I thought within my heart I said we we have to learn to be patient with people that don't understand you know it's easier you see whether someone you see at at the altar all the time or you see someone exhibit some behaviors you don't understand be patient with that person let me say that someone who comes with an alar at don't time I have more respect for him than someone who's pretending AB at least they are honest somewhere at least someone God God will look at it and he will have respect for them than someone who's pretending to have had it all so what we need is to understand that the process we are not responsible for the process the process is God's process of bringing people so J Jesus answered and said unto her who so whoever drinks of this water that you came to get here will thirst again but whosoever will drink of the water that I shall give will never thirst again now this is getting interesting because now every one by one her understanding is getting completely shattered about what God is offering her understanding of what Jesus is offering is being broken down little by little but whatever he says but the water that I shall give that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water that springing up unto everlasting life the woman said sir give me this water so she heard the W the word of God long enough until she got thirsty she heard she heard it and he continually to speak spoke to her until she got thirsty until she came to a place I said I don't understand what it is saying I don't understand where this water is coming from but just give me of that water oh I wonder how many time any of us can just come this morning and say father I may not have a complete understanding of the entire Bible I may not have understanding of the entire mystery but I need that water this morning give me that water that I may live Jesus looked at her and said go call go call your husband and come here now that's a complete twist that's a 360 yeah I thought we were talking about water how is it that the water you're GNA give me is directly connected with me going to get my husband are we still talking about the same water that I'm thinking of or you thinking about a different water how many different types of water are we is there you see the water that Jesus was giving her was directly connected with what was happening in her life the water that Jesus was offering was going to fix her life once and for all amen the water that Jesus off offers it doesn't give you water so you can go back in the same things that you were in to begin with the water that he's giving Is Not to cause to send you right back into the world and the things that you were once you drink of his water your life is change forever and that's what we need to understand this morning the word of God is here to change our lives it's the water that changes you forever it's the word that brings complete transformation in your life so she comes and there was the water that Jesus was giving the water that Jesus would to help her so she can get out of the mess she was in and the woman said I have no husband Jesus said now he's already captive he's completely captivated his spirit and he's read you know I I I I love this as I read it because I see the ministry of our Prophet being manifested once again the the same thing that he did because you have to understand that's how you know that it's the same Jesus yesterday who is the same Jesus today is by seeing that this was not a man this was Jesus Christ performing the same thing that he did because remember the promise was the same that he did to the Jews and Gentile he will have to do it to the to sorry sorry to the Jews and the Samaritan has to be reproduced to the Gentile so he's here doing exactly the same thing now having a spirit captive he looks at him and says you have said well you have no husband you have had five husband and the one that you have now is not even your husband in that God you have spoken truly now we let me say this we fall under the influence of many things and often time we let the devil come and say well that's that's what you are even as our M said this morning you look at yourself and you define Yourself by the job you are doing oh I'm an engineer if they ask you the first thing that comes out oh I'm an engineer no not even a thought I'm a Son of God first before I became an engineer no I'm an engineer I'm this I'm a nurse I'm that why because that's that's that's the the mentality that's what caral carnality has done to us that's what the devil we have been captivated he's taken things and he said well you know that's just how you are and we've taken it yes Jesus telling the woman he says all of the people that you have been they're not even your husband your true husband is your maker your true husband is your creator everybody else is a squatter that's why he says when we read invisible union he says that husband the first husband that came that you were born under he says it wasn't even your fault to begin with you were caught into that but your true husband is standing here why because he's the one who created you and in creating you he had a purpose for you therefore he can look at you and say you have had four and the one you have is not even your husband why because your true husband is standing in front of you right now the word of God the reality and let me say this morning before I move on it's only Christ that can bring its reality to you a preacher cannot do it the Bible cannot do it anybody the word the not a written letter but you have to let God step out of the Written Letter and come and he make himself a real to you that's how you know him but what I'm says this God is not known by intellect it's known by experience it's by him coming out of the pages of the Bible and becoming a reality to you the reason we read is so is so not we can be caught with a letter but it's so that the letter can tell us about what our husband is so we can now have relationship with a husband if it's the letter then how many churches do you have all around the corner we but like our Pastor said we are not a people we are not a I'm sorry we are not just a a church member or a religion but we are a people the the the the end time message is God calling out a people by his own name it's not a gathering of people that want to come and study the Bible no it's a predestinated group of people that God had in his mind in the beginning and the woman said sir now she catches it I perceive you are a prophet but now listen to what he said ni a father worshiped in the mountain and and and you Jews say that it is that is in Jerusalem is the place of worship where we ought to worship when the word is revealed to her when she realize when it's was present she's standing she wants to worship now she wants to offer worship and Jesus answered and said to her woman believe me the hour has come when you will neither be on neither be on this mountain nor in Jerusalem worship it says no in Jerusalem he said the father worshiped the that you will neither be on the mountain nor in Jerusalem worship the father you will worship you worship what you do not know he says we know what worship we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews but the hour has come it says the hour is coming our is when the true worshippers will worship the father in spirit in truth he says the father is seeking such to worship to worship him God is a spirit and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth now I know I don't want to take too much time with this excuse me let me just point out this before I move on by her perceiving now she there is this woman in the situation that she was in even after she had lost everything within her heart and mind she was waiting for a messiah she knew that there was only one man who could bring the change in her life she knew she has been taught to know that regardless of whatever situation I was in oh one day if I can meet the Messiah my life will not be the same again she had this understanding within her that regardless of how mess up my life is there's one man who who can bring about the change so therefore when he came and he spoke to her she knew that the Messiah was the only one who had the ability to go back in the past and reveal those things that were hidden and if he can go back in the past and tell her that he has a power to change your life and that's why she wanted to worship but here is what Jesus told him and I thought if you go if you just pay attention to what he said to her in a moment you'll see how great of a mystery he was talking to her about now we understand that God had established in the Old Testament a worship such that they will go and they will offer sacrifice on the mountain or they will offer sacrifice in temples and all of that and when they did that we re we understand that God will come and he will receive the worship for the burnt offering for whatever because it was a substitution that God had given them but we understand also that the process got so polluted Ed to where he just became a a Act of doing with no heart or no emotional no no sincerity with it it just became well I did this and I'll go offer up sacrifice so they lost the very meaning of what God was give them to do so when now Jesus is looking at her and saying that the hour is come now remember Jesus came to move them from the tradition of the father into the new tradition and we understand that when he died that's how the veil of the temple ripped together so the true worship could be exposed this woman is one of the first to be introduced to that worship he's looking at us says the hour is now is not yesterday it's not what you were doing yesterday what you were doing yesterday is no longer acceptable the worship of the burnt offering of all doing that is no longer is no longer uh what's required what's required now is that God wants those that will worship Him in spirit and in truth when the word is being revealed the difference is what in the old worship when the sacrifice was given the life of the animal could not come upon on the individual but the new way and the introduction of what Jesus was telling her was even right now the worship has changed to where when the sacrifice is accepted that the life of the sacrifice will come directly on you don't forget that so therefore we cannot come to church and say we're worshiping God on the Bible and on the scripture and the spirit of the altar not come upon you let me just move on for the second of time I pray you excuse my voice I I just I fa was not good this morning but I feel like I just trained it for a moment ago so just ask to be patient with me she said I know that when messiah's come who is called Christ when he he comes he will tell us all things he will tell us how to worship he'll tell us where to worship Jesus was moving the worship from a building somewhere from a Mountaintop somewhere into the hearts of individual where God will come The God Who was above us The God Who was with us could become the God in us the Holy Spirit dwelling within the individual that's the worship that he's looking for Hallelujah that's the end time message what Christ is we are not we will be we are he said in that day you shall know that what the father it says the the unity that was between the father and the son you will know the same way that the father was in the Son and the son in the father you will know that I am in you and you in I the unity of the father and his worshippers but one them he talks and he said he makes the statement in the message the UN and if you know where my inspiration came from but B preach a message called in the unfailing reality of the Living God he said in the days of Jesus of Nazareth when he was on here on Earth Walking In the Flesh he found that people in the in that in his day seeking a religion that would bring them Deliverance now I I don't want you to take this word religion as a covering but it it means the body of what could be done what what and as I read you'll know and it says and Christianity meets every challenge that they had asked Christianity meets every Challenge and this is paragraph 60 if you're looking for it Christianity he says meets every challenge that they needed and everything that they ask for it says it challenge everyone that everyone that they need every everyone of their needs but they wouldn't receive it so here here is what I with my thought as I begin with it say we we the the the religion the word of God it came to answer to the needs that men had it it wasn't s for us to just say this is the word of God we'll try to obey it the way I with our best ability and everything no when the word is said is to fulfill or accomplish a certain purpose it's it's to take you and to bring you to a certain destination so when when we we understand by the sins of Adam we find ourselves in the situation that we are in it's God doesn't condemn you for being a sinner we are Sinner by the birth that we came by but it says God condemns you for refusing to accept his provided way what is his provided way is his word that is given to you so if we come here this morning and we have challenges we have desires we have lacking or we have things that we cannot do God doesn't condemn you for coming that way but he condemns you when he's provided a way of Escape you're not taking it and I like that because he's not a god who's after punishing you he a god who's after saving you helping you getting you out of your mess helping you from your situation so it says he constantly he's bringing is not to bring us condemnation but it's to try to bring us out of what we are in into the things that he wants to do the word of God is here to deliver us to heal us to save us so if you can you have one of those things God is here to do that and that's why I I I said this morning that we desire that reality to become more and more because the devil is after trying to make as church members a church member is one who he stands just a step away from whatever the reality reality is so he will come he will accept and he will say oh I believe God is here to save me I believe the word can do that I believe I believe but yet there's something that stops him and the word to become one I believe God can save but not just me no no I have done too much for the word to save me I believe God can heal yeah but mine I got it from my parents is it runs in the family this one is different and I'm speaking to us this morning it or you get into a condition where you read your Bible and there's a promise you say well I believe it I'll just wait until God wants to do do it all of those are the tricks of the enemy to stop you from getting the promise all of those things are excuses that the enemy is putting in your way so you don't get to the promise a real believer when God has said something oh but whatam talks about a man he said oh they came they went to the hospital and and and then they told the child that he was going to die they gave them a final they said there's nothing we can do they're going to die that's a complete death sentence there's nothing we can do and then he says the grandfather came to the meetings and he heard me talk about the Living God and the things that he could do he said he went into his closet he said I'll not get out of this closet until God speaks to me and when he got out he told them the child shall live they said how could could you speak that way he says God told me the child will live and the Child live that's the kind of reality we're looking for people that can grab on to the word of God and press on until it becomes a reality not a passive aggressive or just some P passive believing and no people that wants to see God people that are looking for him people that are hungering you said there's going to come a rapture we're going to call the Rapture to come down Hallelujah the prophet said God is waiting on you and I he didn't say God has anything else to do he's waiting upon you and I if we still satisfy with the things of the world how do we call the Rapture downl if we still like our jobs if we still like our houses if we're still satisfied with the thing that we have how is God going to call the Rapture no wonder God has to come and take everything away from us before we can call out we as Believers of this message we have to constantly Place ourselves in a position where I don't care if if God blesses us with a natural thing let not your affection for the promises be taken away by the things you have if that is happening do like the Rich Young Ruler was asked set it all if if your job if if whatever you are in is taking you away from the affection from the crying out for Rapture from the crying out to the body change take it away ask God to change it for you because remember he says it's only for those that hung and thirst for his righteousness no not those that would do work on the things of the world and say well has he come yet no okay I'll continue a little bit I still have more time is he done oh no no no no nothing has happened okay is Israel still there okay okay good good is America still supporting Israel okay okay we're good is California sink yet no okay we're still good we do that we do that the prophet said it was not governing forces that moved the bride no if the governing forces the event will move the the the the organized churches the bride is moved up by the power of God by the word of the Living God why because something within the heart when they hear the word they want to see the word manifested I don't know how many times I can say it it burns within my heart I want to see the word [Music] amen God becoming a reality in the lives of his children he says when there something come up we go back to our knees we say God you have given us as your children to stand here in this end time to be the very manifestation and representation of Who You Are are we are standing here for our brother we are standing here for our sister our brother Tommy has a sister who is Shen they've given her a death sentence Lord we stand here as the Church of the Living God we say let life come back into that body according to Thy word where people that hunger to see God the moment we go out our mind is full of the things that we have to do you got to do this you got to go shopping we to do this don't forget to pay the bills and then the only time there's a little bit of space created is when we walk into the church and when we walk in we only have 15 minutes of attention before we start thinking about tomorrow we think about our job on Sunday like before Monday has come everybody's already planning oh first hour we're going to do this second hour I got this meeting we're going to go here we're going to do this is that really Rapture condition is that Rapture Ready and I hope this is not condemnation I hope this is trying to as the scripture will say I'm here it says that I may take that we may just take our minds and and take it and and bring awareness of the promises of God for the end time we live for our go we live for God and not for our job and the things of the world the our priority is the word of God what the word of God said is what we'll do now let me just jump and I I didn't but what I'm talks about MDC and I thought initially I was going to call this experience the coming to experience with MDC now Y is Abraham butam said but when he talks about MDC I'll just summarize it if if those of you that don't know please I'm sorry I just I I don't I wouldn't have time to go through it all now when he speaks about this MDC he said he had no father no mother no beginning of time he had no offsprings to where you can say he came from year as his children he came from nowhere we don't even know he said he must be an eternal being now the scripture says Abraham is return R turning from the battles there he is after suffering after going through all kinds of stuff after going to fight for his brother and everything he finally gets an audience with this person after fighting the case of life after fighting against all the things of the enemy after fighting the devil you get audience with MDC he comes and he gives him Bread and Wine to strengthen him and but bam said if you go read that message he said that this guy this MDC he says he was a person the person who was he he was the [Music] word he was not a thought he was not a thought we all was a thought but the thought moved into the logos which was the word what is the word the word is the thought being expressed it was an expression of something when he came to Abraham he was the only one who knew what the life of Abraham was to be at the end let me say this my brother my sister there's only one who knows something about your life and that's the same one amen don't look for anybody else to tell you about your life find the same MDC he says the same MDC turned out to be Jesus Christ and in the end time the same MDC came yes but whatam says when he stood there this m and this is just me paraphrasing he was the only one who actually had the original mind of what you were supposed to be in the beginning what I'm said he had the secret of our journey and life and death and life after he knew are all of it so yeah you are you are born in sin and confusion and everything there's someone standing in front of you say you were predestinated to be in the mind of God in the beginning you don't even know it because you bypass your theophany you were in the mind of God over there he created you yes you came from sin but he knew that when I spoke my word you will understand it you will hear the word and it will change your life amen that's the person you want to meet that's the author of this Bible that's not a me that's a person is a reality hallelujah [Music] hallelujah now God spoke to Abraham many other ways but his life his body was not changed until he met the person of the word himself we look for changes where there's no change all right but said those old chisan it says they brought the kingdom of God down they brought the process they brought the promises of God down if God spoke something they they would St their lives until it come to pass are we doing the same thing he stood there and he looks at Abraham why did Sarah laugh he knew that Sarah was behind the tent even as it said I will come again and Sarah will have a child now remember the problem was not them for them to go young because they were young and they didn't have any children but somehow the presence of mezc was to inject life into them so it's not just to change your body but it was importing life the purpose of this mzc at the end time remember when the messenger talks about the church ages it says the prophet was at the beginning but in between it was a bunch of reformers and only a prophet came to the end time and the prophet will tell you that the word of God only comes through the prophet so at the end time God needs to reject his own life so he can get the result that he's looking for but how can you get the result until you meet the same m in the day of Jesus Christ he looked at him he says when Abraham saw my day he rejoiced they looked at him and said you're not even 50 but they failed to realize that he was not caught in time he was an eternal being he was was the very manifestation of the thoughts of God in the beginning my brother my sister let's get into the thoughts of God that will manifested of us let's not be the people that are caught in sin today and sin tomorrow or let be let's get out of that stuff and the only way to get out of that stuff is to be MDC himself the author of The Bible the one who started it all the creator of all things he came from eternity he took a body he took of the 16 elements he made himself a flesh he came but one them says this being is misunderstood and then the question to you is why do we have to know about him why because he's the only one who can impart life he's the only one who knows the secret about of Life of your life it was hidden to yourself but it came here and reveal it with the opening of The Seven Seals not only that the same one said that the Seed of Abraham will experience the same thing that their father experienced when he when he met his father Our Father Abraham he says I'm doing this so that your seed when they come forth they will meet the same person they won't recognize it by his flesh because remember he changed flesh in the days of Jesus he changed flesh in the end time but when they will hear the same word they will know that's him speaking my sheep know my voice another they will not follow that's why I want to say this message is not for everybody but if God has opened your eyes to hear us to see him I want a s I want his life to be my life don't give me intellect it's a now let me say this because I think we take it wrong when we say intellect I think it's it's important to know the scripture it's commendable because when God does he will he will speak to you by his word so you have to know what his word said but that's not enough to know his word but whatam says I know the author that's what matters so if you don't know the word let him let him Express his word to you go read it that's fine but after you read it let the person of that word become a reality to you if the musician could come this morning the reality of the Living God butam says the the devil will try to make you a church member yeah pay your ties do this he says that's wonderful but he will try to come you'll come to church and and you'll sit there pay attention who sang in the wrong key who sang a special who did what and all of that who who dress up with what clothes and who did what and they will keep you that way way but God is here the holy spirit is here to put you in contact with melc himself it's like I heard I believe I heard it from our pastor he said you what you have the right to say this morning that whoever wrote the Bible I want to meet the man himself I'm tired of somebody telling me about this man I have the right to conference with God himself and I declare to you this morning you have the right to call upon his name and say you wrote your word I heard it but I want to see you for myself not for the pastor not for somebody else not for my parent but my myself I want to know you the same way they know you I'm not satisfied with anything short and if anybody doesn't have it I want to be the first to have it don't sell yourself short don't let's not reason in the realm of what has been he's here to do something new he's here to do according to his word we come and if we're not careful we become whatever the other does we have limitation so you can only do up to here if you do here you become a fanatic what's wrong with us let God manifest himself the way he wants to manifest all I care is his word to be manifest to me I want the reality of what he wrote here to be my reality the bride and the bridegroom are one how are they becoming one the bridegroom is here revealing himself in the form of his bride amen that's the end time prophecy God bless you let's all stand let's just bow our heads sorry I I just lost my voice I just can't go on we'll probably pick on this another time but I hope you can hear my heart this morning I just think this the devil has so many tricks so many ways and so many exits you know we can say those that don't have the message yeah we can understand you know they've been caught up in the denomination that's why they do what they do and everything but we have had the opportunity for our eyes to be open but the same devil is also around here trying to to create a different narrative about the word of God you know where it becomes and if we're not careful and you know people start to fall away and people start to do things that are ungodly and everything and and we saw well he was not saved oh that this is no that's not what we are looking for we want the reality of God to be manifested from the children to the grown-ups we want to be in the economy of God and there's only one that can do it and that's God himself am Alo therefore when we preach the gospel our desire is so you can come in contact with MDC himself that he can change your life he can bring his reality to you so you can never be the same but what I'm says the holy spirit is not there to heal to your desires the holy spirit is there to kill all of your desires and bring forth God's desire in you it will cause you to walk away from the things of the world it will cause you to no longer desire when you do the things which are unpleasing to Heart your heart cry out and say God I don't want to do this am at one place I didn't read it but I'll just say it he says people get enough holy spirit so they just don't lie they don't steal you know they just know make sure I don't want to go to hell that's not enough it says God wants to fill every fiber of your being and I say God fill me up this morning let me not just be satisfied with this measure where because I'm not lying that means I'm good no I want enough holy spirit that I can defeat the army of the devil that I can stand up for my brother that I when there's a problem I can stand there and God can be manifested in me enough Holy Spirit to stand in the position you have given given me not enough to just be satisfied oh I'm a Christian praise God no what is it that you would have me do Lord the son can do nothing except what he sees the father [Music] do enough Holy Spirit to care enough Holy Spirit to lay your life down for the others enough Holy Spirit to care for the one who doesn't see who doesn't understand not to look one another with the eye of what does he think who is he with with a ey to look and say oh I wish God could reveal himself to him that's the kingdom of God if that's what you desire this morning just lift your hand up to him and say father I have seen your reality yes but I want more than this morning I I couldn't be what I am this morning if I hadn't come in contact with a real reality I am what I am because of your reality but I'm not satisfied oh God I'm not just come by our way this morning and there needs and his cry out and this the devil hipping havoc and but oh God you said that your army will defeat everything that the devil will bring Lord that we may hunger more for the reality of you more than we hunger for our jobs and our things come into the manifestation of the Living God if he said it the prophet said one place he said where is that reality if God said is is this and is that how do we come in contact with it father let us come in contact with you this morning your word is the gateway to your promises we have heard you we have received your word the scripture says that your word makes an entrance into your kingdom Lord an entrance shall be made into the Everlasting Kingdom of the Lord and your word is the only thing that makes an entrance Lord and your entrance giveth life as it says in Psalms father give us life this morning and life more abundantly you said that you will what the Lord you promised to do he says is more abundantly is more than what even our mind can conceive and we desire that this morning I pray for the a lifted hands Lord and Lord you said that when we lift our hands we defy gravity father may you just hear our cry this morning and just touch us and bring us into that reality of the Living God a place where all things are possible a place where we don't pay attention to the flesh but where all attention are placed on Heavenly things when know that our father will take care of us we ask father that you hear our cry this morning we commit everything that we are to you be lifted up in our midst and touch those that are afflicted father even those that are home couldn't make it this morning Lord we pray that you remember them remember our needs Lord and may testimony comes forth for because we have had Faith to believe your word to say that the god Living God has made himself a reality to me we love you and we commit everything to you and ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen let's just invite brother Matthew this morning amen if you desire prayer you just come we'll pray for you let's just sing that as he comes oh pour your spirit out on me my heart and make me whole I Need You Now pour your spirit out oh pour your spirit out on me oh fall just like the rain saturate my thirsty Soul come and fall aresh on me my cup again oh and make me whole I need you now for your spirit out what a wonderful word that we've heard this morning aren't you [Music] thankful the reality of a living [Music] God I don't I don't want to just run out of here and this just be another service just just another Duty another couple hours in a day do you know that reality it's too cold out there to stand out in the parking lot and have Fellowship maybe just spend a little few more moments here and why don't you you ask yourself do I do I really have the reality of the Living God in my life the reality of his presence you know his brother Billy was ministering he started to talk about the woman at the well in the formula and how how how how are you going to draw water how are you going to do this how he was speaking of a living water and I I I got to thinking you know that's that's what we we we so many times we start to think of the formula and we're like well I got to have a bucket and I got to have a rope and I got to do all these things if I'm going to have this living water if I'm going to get the revelation of the of the message then do I got the do I got the right tools do I got all the right things to what is this living water he's talking about I I got to get myself already ready and do all these things no it it wasn't about what she had wasn't about her ability to draw the water but as he started to discern the thoughts and intents of her heart go get your husband in other words I know your life I know the secret of your journey I know what you've been through I know you you've had mistakes in your past and you've fallen down so many times and you feel like you can never be restored I know about all those things and once he started to discern the thoughts and intents of her heart then that's when she didn't need her bucket she didn't need her rope she didn't need any of those things all she needed was him I was thinking as he ministered about Abraham and Sarah you know Sarah laughed in her heart why was Sarah laughing her she didn't have a revelation or an understanding of who that was a really who that was that was standing there that was speaking I say I I want a revelation of who this mzc is we we need a greater Revelation and understanding of what has been delivered to us or we're just back to intellect we're just trying to figure this out we're just trying to put the pieces together but as brother Billy said what what was he there to do he was there to inject life the reality a change there was there was something there that God had come to do and say Lord I I want to know what what you're here to do [Music] Lord I want that reality I want that power in my life Lord Jesus I don't just want to run out the door and not be changed I want to be changed I want to be changed I want to know him in the power of his resurrection and as we T and sing a few more songs ask yourself is is that reality there he said Abraham rejoiced to see my he are you [Music] rejoicing he said before Abraham was I am where are we standing in the presence of the I am let him discern the thought and intent of your heart let that word become a reality and I just wanted to labor for a moment as brother Billy offered for those that need prayer if you need prayer if you need a reality if you need something to break the scripture says and Sarah by faith receive strength to conceive seed that's what we need Lord May our faith rise up to another level this morning Lord Lord may may may by faith we re receive strength to conceive this word your presence has come amongst us you are here Jesus Christ is here to impart life to you we're in his presence the reality of a living God is right here but are we like Sarah not realizing who it is really that's standing here this morning are we missing something I ask are we missing something where we're so quick to run back into the week and just go through the routine just just another good service brother Billy good job we've done our religious Duty back back to the Grind again back to lady oia I say I'm done with it I'm done with the rat race I'm done with with trying to chase everything I I'm done with trying to be comfortable and lady oia I'm done with running for all the there's only one thing that matters and that's Rapture I'm so busy with trying to be comfortable I'm so busy with trying to Make a Better Living I'm so busy trying to get a nicer car and a better career I've totally I I've lost complete focus of the whole picture going to going to run out the church and who won this game who won that game what who's leading in the polls what what none of that matters there's only one thing that matters right now you're in his presence so as we sing this song again as we sing the song they're [Music] playing why don't you ask God lord I realize I've been living below my privileges the reality of this message has not been in effect in my life and Lord I'm hungering and you said if I hunger and thirst I shall be filled so I invite you if you don't have that reality in your life don't leave here without it just T here as we sing this song brother Billy's here to pray for you if it's just for one will y'all will y'all bind together and Faith this isn't just brother Matthew up here uh
