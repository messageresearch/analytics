Believers that there's nothing we love more than his presence with us amen amen sister Iris has a testimony amen she could come at this time amen God bless you I'm a little nervous so this is going to be quick but I just wanted to testify because I believe it's important to and it's always so encouraging when other people do so um first I wanted to testify about something that I wanted to for a really long time um and I should have a really long time ago but um so I've struggled with really horrible stomach aches um for a really long time I've basically had one every single day since I was 13 and I just wanted to say that I'm Healed and and even if all the symptoms are still there um I just wanted to testify and claim it right now so this last weekend I went to a camp and I had a lot of my heart but the biggest thing I was praying for was joy and it seemed like most of my life I've been just really sad and I just thought that was the way I was always going to be I just always thought I was going to be prone to sadness in depression um but God wants his children to be happy so um one of the nights at Camp there was a prayer line and then after I went through the prayer line I received my joy also before Camp I wrote down like a whole list of expectations that I had um of needs and there were some things that I didn't even write down because um I didn't even have faith for that kind of freedom but after I went through the prayer line those needs were met so I just wanted to testify that if you're sad he can turn that into joy and he's a faithful God and he can do exceedingly and abundantly above above and beyond whatever you could ask or think [Applause] amen wonderful amen I like that amen that's what asking big mens right you get healing you get joy and things that you didn't write down you still get them you get all of it together amen that's the kind of God we serve he he doesn't want us to be sad he doesn't want us to remain sick he he's got so much blessing to give to his children amen what a wonderful God we serve amen kfg amen you hold my every moment you call my ring se you walk with me fire and he Al Mighty oh and I trust Lord I trust

tonight it's the same one that promised he would meet us here every single night it's the King of Kings and the Lord of lords he's the one that is the Alpha and the Omega he's the beginning and the end he's the one who created all things and that all things consist by him amen he's here to meet your need tonight he's here to to to have a special visit individually with each one of us he has something special for you grab a hold of the lifeline tonight and let God move amen let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord how we thank you oh God for the The Joy Bells Oh God that Lord you said in your word Lord and thy presence is fullness of joy Lord and we believe oh God that we're in your presence Lord Lord let it be a permanent work of Joy Lord Lord that continues to Bubble from that Fountain that's filled with blood drawn from Emmanuel's veins father we just so entrusting Lord our needs the service Lord the few words that'll be spoken Lord oh God will you break it and divide it only as you can by Your Word of Promise may the great surgeon oh God take the word of God and C cut out oh God what's not needed for the journey Lord we're looking for a Rapture father and so we pray that your spirit would take full control Lord and that you would be glorified in this little time of Fellowship we pray you'd Bless the people in their needs for the glory of God we ask in Jesus Christ's name amen amen well praise the Lord if you have your Bibles and you want to turn with me we just go right into the word of God and in Revelations chapter 3 we'll read a few scriptures and so appreciate the testimonies and you know it's an Evidence and a confirmation that God is still moving on the hearts of his believing children to do for them what they have need of amen and Revelations chap 3 A Familiar verse we'll go to uh paragraph 19 or um verse 19 Revelations 319 to 21 says this as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock if any any man hear my voice now this is to an individual right if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and I will s with him and he with me to him that overcome will I grant to sit with me in my father's throne in my throne even as also as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what what the spirit sayith unto the churches and also another scripture back a few chapters in second Timothy second Timothy chapter 1 we're going to read four verses there in paragraph 3-7 second Timothy chapter 1 and verse three it reads like this it says I think God who I serve as my forefathers with a pure conscience now that's that's a good condition to be in with a pure conscience that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day greatly Desiring to see thee being mindful of thy tears that I may be filled with joy when I call to remembrance the for unforged faith that is in thee notice where this is at which dwell first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother units I am persuaded that in thee also wherefore I put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God which is in thee by the putting on of my hands for God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind we trust the Lord will add a blessing to the reading of his word you may have your seats as um you know the ministry's been ministering to us has been such an inspiration to realize that God is restoring a faith and it's coming our time there's a time that what God had promised it's going to be materialized because he planted a seed within us and as we read the scripture there's something that just jumped out at me while I was in the office I just kind of turned a little bit but it says I will put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God and I think that's something that we must do is we must stir up the gift of God in our lives you know if if ever we're going to live we want to live by the gift that God has given us you know God has placed a special designation on his bride of Jesus Christ you you're the individual that God has planted something inside of the seed that can respond to the word of God something that can hear what the spirit is saying we want to stir that gift of God up sometimes we forget that we have a gift of God sometimes we go along life and we just try to work things through because well someone has given us a a a spirit of fear who is this this is not God the the scripture said God has not given us the spirit of fear so what what hindereth why do we have this mental oppression why does this condition come upon our minds because someone has tried to give us the spirit of fear yes but oh my thanks be to God that God has sent a comforter God has sent a a word of God that can direct our steps that can put us back on the pathway can point to the cross of Calvary where God had made peace with I mean we have peace with God amen amen I got to thinking about you know the uh message how can I overcome and brother Billy referred to this quote in here and I I just thought you know if if if we can recognize that we have a gift of God that God he's not pleased with just our everyday life he wants us to live by faith he's he's provided a way for us and we want to go into that and let it guide us amen because as we go along in life's journey we realize there's a lot of opposition there's a lot of testing there's a lot of Trials but God has planted something on the inside that can give us Victory and it's actually an attribute of himself yeah amen it has to come to the surface somehow oh my and how kind of over come he says this I want to take a text this morning how can I overcome now I chose this because I think that it's the time that we should never let the spirit of Revival die we've got to keep in Revival constantly revived every day Paul said I Die daily that Christ might live amen we must never let the Revival die within us amen and I'm I'm I'm so thankful that God has provided times where we can Fellowship where we can get together and the expectation can be raised and we can expect God to move amen but as the prophet is telling us we met we don't want to have this uh you know place where we come to where we're like oh we get to where we're just waiting for the ministry to do something or or we're waiting for the next person to do something what what he's telling us is we we don't want to let the spirit of Revival die we got to stir up that gift that's within us amen we're we're going through difficulties but God wants to give us victory in our difficulties he wants us to press into the battle to know my God is going to meet me at the point of need because he said he would he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the very end amen so the very difficulties that we're facing now is to reveal his glory in every single one of us the seed the potentials within the seed amen and that seed life has to come to germination by the new birth once the germination has come into the existence amen there's a rest for the believer you come to a place of rest where God now he can say where where is my child I know where to find him when the time and the Trials come I want to manifest my goodness you know there's a lot of voices in this world there's a lot of spirits that are trying to oppress our faith but praise God the test comes to settle the questions amen I have the seat of God in Me I'm going to Stir It Up This devil has come and I have the authority by God's word to call Jesus on the scene the seat of God in Me Is Enough amen with the spirit on the seed it'll bring forth life it'll resurrect me out of this condition amen I believe that amen we never want the spirit of Revival to die and I'm not talking about just experiencing church services but I'm talking about kicking out the trash I'm talking about God beat the the gold that that has impurities out of me I want to see God in Me amen I want Divinity to manifest itself in my very flesh because he paid the price amen he did sanctification justification but this is the hour this is where the Holy Ghost is to come and embody a people that are reviv that's stirring up the gift of God in their lives amen isn't that wonderful God promised it he said I I won't leave you comfortless but I'll be with you and then all of a sudden we're looking into the mirror of God's word the promise of the hour has come amen this is your time to shine rise for the glory of God has come it's your day believe it amen watch God work miracles we've seen our sister testify praise God it's there's the gift within I'm next amen you might have been battling you might have been fighting but your hour is here amen receive it tonight amen God wants to give us the spirit of Revival to kick out the trash to I I don't I'm not going to settle with this I'm not going to camp out with this thing they said it's a genetic thing where you go through depression but I'm telling you I heard a word amen that that God that's in me is greater than this depression I'm not going to bow down to it yeah I'm going to lift Jesus up amen I'm not settling for nothing less but Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen I thought I was just going to do a little teaching tonight praise God to stir up the gift amen oh my did you did you notice the arrangement of that set with me in my Throne not on my throne in my Throne that is his Dominion as Christ is ruler Throne ruler at this time of a complete domain of God so will the church be with him the bride with him in his throne the the entire domain not on my throne but in my Throne see his domain reaches the throne is over a domain Hallelujah the domain reaches as far as its boundaries does amen and it's from eternity to Eternity just think of it oh my and here we are in this little hickey of time what what is the trial to our God Amen the solution has come the answer has come and it's in you amen my now as we study this my purpose of this is just not to come and have fellowship with you people but I love to do that but if I had a chance I would go to your homes and shake your hands and talk with you sit down eat dinner and sit down under a shade tree and talk and fellowship but when we come here we are here for one specific purpose this is the house of correction this is the throne this is the Throne of God and judgment Goes Forth from the house of God and here is where we come together gathered in love with one another as only Christians can love but in here we are we are under a leadership of the Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost is among us and we're here to be take Reckoning among us to see where our short places are our shortcomings and how we can catch from where we should be over to where we ought to be where we are and where we ought to be and that's what we study Minister study these places for their people that they see the people the lack and begin at that oh my if we didn't have a message how would it be clear for the ministry this is a sure moral word of Prophecy this is very clear yes we see the lack and I believe that sometimes we get to where we get in a routine we get to doing it and it has to be the way that otherwise we get uncomfortable well I heard brother brandom say we want to get comfortable enough to get saved get somebody else saved we want to take that old mindset that old mental way of thinking and lay that to the side long enough that the spirit of revival can come and say I am not going to let the defeats of yesterday hold me back from having a Revival today I'm going to stir up the gift that's within me it's so easy to get in a rut where that mental battle that oppresses us you'll always have this you'll always be this but praise God we can fight the devil just like our sisters and start quoting the word of God that's thus sayith the Lord that's going to have dominion over my heart it'll renew my mind and it'll bring this body subject to my testimony because that's the formula I believe it and God's the one that's obligated if you really from sincerity and belief in Your Heart Take the word of God put it on your lips with a believing heart there's nothing can stop it that's what faith does th for the believer it doesn't matter if you don't see it for 25 years the father of our faith waited he was longsuffering he believed God was able to perform what he promised you know it's definitely one of those times where you know when we when we go through difficulties and we know that there's things in our lives that aren't right and we we want the Revival to drive out those negativity because we want to be those types of people that realize the full promise God is conditioning our heart our spirit our atmosphere that we won't have no pretense we don't have to have no fronts we can be exactly who God made us to be you'll be the best version of you when you and God become one and you'll let go of everything else that has ever tried to hinder you from serving God with all of your heart that's what we're striving for that's what we're Desiring is to see God come in such a way that he can have preeminence that he can take full control not just of our present but of our past and our future we have to learn to let go we have to surrender to God and it's not a one-time deal because we learn to surrender more and more and more more every day we learn to let go of different things that this person it wasn't right that they did this such and such or I didn't do certain something right but you know from sincerity we can go and confess our faults you know the love of God says you know what even if they reject me even if they turned away my Lord was rejected so I have the potential on the inside to do what's right no matter what I can be free I can be liberated the holy GH ghost has come to liberate us to bring us into the promised land it's a land of promise [Music] amen that we can worship Him in spirit and in truth praise God you know overcome means to keep life in you you know if we're going to have this revival we're going to have to keep life in us you know when the en enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises a standard against it amen and there's so many voices there's so many spirits coming in to try to infiltrate our minds just to keep us busy just to keep us looking down but we have a message amen we have something on the inside that can rise above our condition faith in the word of God will give you sight for the victory even though you're you're bound in a condition tonight amen we must keep life in us you know we must live constantly in the Life of Christ you know it's so easy to live in our own life you know it's so easy for us to Aspire to be like somebody else that's having Revival you know we don't want to lower our standards we want to Rejoice with those who Rejoice but God has some don't bow down for anything less than your Revival where God has full control now this is not going to be taken very easily this is going to have to be taken by force death is is in one way it's easy but in another way I mean when when we go through like chastisement for the moment is not pleasant but afterwards if we can start looking for the afterwards you know by faith saying you know what I'm going to let the hand of God because God chastens those who he loves and we want to understand the love of God God is a god of love can you imagine if parents would just be like ah you know Junior you can play in the in the street if you want to I mean God will protect you you know traffic and all no a real father a real mother will go out there and correct them say there's dangers that are out there that you might not understand today but you're going to understand later just trust me so when God comes with his correcting hand it's his love for us it brings us back into the right relationship that he desires amen so we want to be able to let go of some of these things that are trying to keep us reminds me of the S and the you know the parable of of the s that sowed seed in the different three different conditions that's the way we get sometimes there's cares of the world and the the pressures for Rich all these things they try to choke out the very life in you to manifest his glory to manifest things that brings you that complete joy and satisfaction that says I'm a Believer and tell somebody about it amen what we have what we possess is worthy to be told to somebody amen that's what God do he did that in this generation he manifest The Word of Promise and we've got it we've got the cloud of witness you know it it's all around us amen and he tells about it amen we want to be outdoing and testifying The Works of God I I so appreciate it we want to stir this gift up don't don't let the Revival die when God does something for you continue to testify don't let go don't stop the devil will try to get you to go back don't you just keep testifying be like a John Ryan it didn't matter it was two three weeks but he said praise God extra extra I'm healed amen the mockery might come the voices will come but you keep testifying and one day it's going to be your hour one day it's going to be your moment amen just keep going forward believing amen my this is the age of the personal life of Christ amen see God has now cleansed a place for us and set aside he Sanctified a place that we can serve him praise God I I want to revive my heart to recognize God has placed us in a a time and an hour where we have the opportunity to serve God like no other age what a privilege amen I don't want to miss my opportunity I don't want to be just so bound down to the cares of life and all of these things that clog up the channel like you know it's like praise God I can renew my mind I can read my Bible and one day just like he said he would he would come by and Quicken the word to us that's the spirit is the only thing that can Quicken the word so that's why we want to get in the spirit of Jesus Christ and say revive me to this reality amen amen now the thing you have to overcome is yourself your idea your thing and surrender yourself to him he overcome for you and he knows the way oh I love that I love that because because a lot of times it's just our human nature we get into a condition and we begin to automatically it's just automatic we start trying to figure things out that's just our nature but if we can recognize that God he's already overcome for us he overcome death he overcome the grave he overcome hell he overcame Temptation I I think about this whenever he was born they mocked him and ridiculed him because even though the scriptures said that have come the same way we have to overcome by the word of God and he was 12 years old and he's going to the synagogues and he's teaching can you imagine a 12-year-old standing here all of a sudden he just he starts teaching and all of their eyes are like I mean he he's talking of an eternal God and they're they're just like where where did he get this wisdom can you imagine what he had to overcome when Mary came and says your father and I have been seeking you with tears can you imagine he he could have said oh really but he came back with the word cu the word always corrects the error he said don't you know I must be about my father's business even though there was a pressure all of the Sanhedrin all of the ministry was there witnessing to Mary denying her own testimony she was the very one that saw the angel Gabriel visit her and said that which is in you is of the Holy Ghost but in a moment yes in a certain condition all of a sudden the pressure a spirit of fear maybe Came Upon her oh my son where is he oh my but he overcome by the word of God and by humility he said don't you know I must be about my father's business and he was going in straight out the clergy amen that's the same for this day there was a man sent from God oh my but the church World they have pushed out Christ and now he's knocking trying to get back in and now it's to the individual praise God for individuals that are in Revival that are not pushing back God when he wants to come and correct the error that's what I'm believing for in my life I believe that God has not finished with me yet but I believe that he's got that hammer just like they they beat the gold and every time he beats it's just getting more pure gold more pure gold so he can see the reflection of himself amen now look friends I believe they're taping this and if it's on the the tape pardon me whatever you do listen now who will listen and Hereafter the hour is very late and you do not you do have good intentions but be caught inside now don't struggle not him that willth nor him that runneth but God just let God that's that's as simple just let God just yield yourself to him and walk on with a perfect satisfied faith that what God has promised he is able to perform not joining one denomination another denomination running this that or the other trying this just yield yourself to God and walk with him peaceful quiet not interrupted just keep on walking with him that's right oh that sounds pretty good but you know what you have the potential to do that the prophet wouldn't be speaking that if that's seed inside doesn't have the potential there's got to be something that will respond that's what I told our brother who just had a breakdown see just yield to him he's here he knows what you have done and what caused you your being and doing this way and all of that he knows all about it he knows all about you and now he just told you back there what to do now I said only thing you need to do is just go do it and that is I'm glad he didn't just leave it there he said forget all of the Past walk live for the future in the glory and presence of God Amen I thank God that we had a prophet that was transparent you know one of the things that I I so appreciate about the Servants of God is they're transparent when they make a mistake or they go through difficulties they're willing to open up you know brother brandham said in a message called reaction to an action I believe is how it's titled but you know he was all tore up and they were going through the case where they said that because he signed the checks and different things for the the expenses on their campaigns that it was his money and they had him for five years over this deal and you know the attorney had called and he's like I just he was under the load and he pushed back from the table and he started headed out and he said tell him I'm not here and he walked out and you know it was said that you know Ma was saying you know that's not right and different things and you know he goes to pray for a little baby and the Spirit came and said you know you're going to go pray for that baby he said wait a minute I gotta go make something right first you know and I believe that that spirit is timid and we can walk right over it but we've been given an example when we if we really want the Revival and the liberty of God's spirit we want to kick out the trash we want to kick out these little things that we try to make excuses for things that are not right in our lives we want the spirit of God to come and cleanse us because it's very simple we just confess our wrongs plead the blood and God is faithful to to cleanse us if we want Revival if we want the Purity the conscious the Consciousness that God is present many times people the reason why they do the things they do they don't recognize his presence right they get into conditions and they just somehow forget they're like I don't understand I don't recognize I can do this and I don't feel wrong I can just go ahead and continue on but there is seed inside that's a part of God and you take him everywhere where you go you want to recognize his presence don't grieve the spirit of God he is with you he will help you call upon him he's an everpresent help in a time of trouble amen God is more willing to help you than you are to be helped that's according to the word of God the hard part is is to walk humbly before him because we don't want to be humiliated we have a pride and an ego we have an arrogance we have press PR we have popularity we have so much we're so full but God's saying if you want what I have you can't have the world and my kingdom also you make your choice to you that will overcome that I will grant to you to sit with me in my Throne God showed us the way he gave us the example he he said you don't know these things Peter I love the communion scripture he says but you don't know these things right now what I'm doing for you but you'll know after and sometimes that's the same with us I love the examples because Peter you know he got real jealous he's like well you're never going to wash my feet but then he said if if I don't wash your feet you ain't clean he said whoa and see that's how we do we do like Peter and we say well wash my hands and my head also you know he just man we go for everything then but instead of the word just says you know what you're you're clean by the w word that I spoke to you if you'll believe my word and take it in your heart you're free from the bondage you can go free sanctify them by the truth Thy word is truth there's never been a more Sublime scripture according to the description by our prophet he said I sanctify myself for them oh my to think that you were in a condition I was in bondage I didn't have any hope of Liberty but because somebody Sanctified themselves because he knew without that I couldn't go free oh my to think that he loved us so much that he willingly no man can take my life I lay it down and no man could say this statement but the Creator God himself he says I Lay My Life down and I'll take it up again and that same God is in you so if you'll lay down your life he'll say the same thing in your life I'll take my life up again amen that's the promise of God's word now this is where brother Billy jumped in and kind of got me realizing this is so rich but in 92 it says see maybe we'll read 91 notice each Church age the same overcome when they when each son out of each Church age overcome the temptation of that age I got the scripture here I don't think we really have time to make it but we know that each one of the church age is the same now it's just like someone who see as I said at the beginning you are born defeated and that birth will never bring you to life but you're born defeated and in a defeated World in a defeated amongst defeated people among defeated creeds defeated denominations you've got to come to Victory some way oh and I love that and that the story of the Lily just it just it just speaks so much to my heart and I you know I'm so thankful for it but maybe if we just read another little bit and see if the Lord will open something to us but it says it's just like a lily where Lily I think is one of the most prettiest flowers there there is I'm fond of the Great caes and the pond lies I think there's nothing hardly as pretty as a great big Pond Lily they call it a cow Lily how it's Radiance now where does it come from it's a little seed down at the bottom of the muddy Mucky Pond and that little seed yet all of the radiance that's ever to shine in it is in it right then then it's in the mud when it is in the mud but it has to strive daily knowing that there is something it's black it's dirty it's Mucky it's slimy in the Slime that is living in yet it presses its way through the mud and muck and Waters and stagnant places until it sticks his head above in the light and expresses what had been hid all the time amen you know that helps me so much because I can look at my condition I can look at my flesh I can look at my past I can look at it and recognize that was the mud that was the the diff you know the different the stagnant places can you imagine when you got stuck you got stuck as a Christian but you were in the water you were in the mud but you still had the potentials of God but something is pulling the the the sunlight of God's word is pulling that life to the surface amen so we just keep deess and even though we're going through a stagnant Place God is drawing us amen so I think that's an overcomer once in sin did things that was wrong don't worry about it now you have the permission you have the Liberty I have the Liberty if if you you want true Liberty you have to lay those things down you have to let those things that are behind stay there let him go amen God by his predestination see he brought this seed to life and it's pressing itself see coming to light and now on the top of all of that it has overcome see it doesn't Express itself down there it's getting up here to express itself neither did you in your sins and your adultery and everything that you lived in you didn't Express nothing you know I thank God for that because you know a lot of times we hold on to things that we have in the past whether they're good bad or indifferent sometimes it's harder to let go of the bad than a good but there's always two sides right sometimes we take these good qualities well I was a good this and I was a good that and we try to measure our worth based on our good or our bad but he's saying you didn't Express nothing that's right you want Revival if you let those things stay into your present you didn't Express nothing with that it's no good now we got to rise above it we got to stick our head in the sunlight of God's word the message of the hour amen you didn't Express nothing but there's a little seed in there and and it got a chance to press itself into the light and now you're in the presence of Jesus Christ with the sunlight it brought you out what you really was in the beginning you see what I mean you saw the light you bloomed out you laid your heart open and now you're a lily you remember my sermon on Lily the Lily Reverend Lily how he toils and yet does not he not spin yet Solomon in all his glory is not a Raiden like one of the look at him he's ready not taking nothing for himself the Lily don't care nothing about himself what does he do he throws his Beauty out his life that others might see his life is expressed out that others might see the glory what is in him that was in him him in the mud now he's on the top you know I think that sometimes we hold back you know and I'm speaking for myself sometimes we hold back you know we have pretense but that's part of the the battle that we must overcome we must overcome it but if you're not aware of it how are you going to ask God to help you overcome it it's time to get honest I want to be honest and say you know what I'm not in this condition I care for myself we do we do but what he's saying is you have the potential to let go and fully trust your cares all into his hands amen that's where the Liberty is that's where freedom is the Lily don't care nothing about himself he just gives it out for others that others might see and that's an overcomer he overcome the mud he overcome the things of the world now he freely gives himself out everybody can look at him his life you can't put a finger on it he's a real Overcomer you can't say nothing about him he's come out of the mud he's not in the mud now he's on top amen he can't put and point back to what he was what he is now he's on the top amen oh my then the bees come by and say oh that's wonderful perfume I believe I'll go and get up my part my he just opens up his heart come on now every all right everything takes him takes from him he's a real Pastor he expressed the glory of God look where he come from he had to overcome to do that you know as we're reading the the message you point that thing that you know that God is dealing with your heart say I must overcome that because I there's something about this test because now understand that the test is the greatest thing that ever happened to you because that's the Proving Ground because that's where God he says now those I love I Chas and rebuke so this test was brought upon us to bring out the glory and grace of God just like our pastor was talking about that blind man in John N where he was just born and all of a sudden all these people were starting to make all these different accusations and they were just coming in and that's what our mind does making accusations about your past and about your present and about your future but he's got a narrative but we must stand on the word of God and turn that devil and cause him to flee say devil I'm resisting you in the name of Jesus Christ I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God God has allowed me to go through the test that the glory of God might be made known in my life and then it wouldn't just be my life but then others will hear the word of Life the word of God for deliverance or or salvation or healing and then they'll take heart they'll say praise God if God he's no respector of persons he did it for that person if I'll take the word of God and do like they did God's obligated to me cuz he doesn't change if we'll approach it in the same way God is obligated amen that's just simple it's just the way God loves to do is to perform his word to us amen praise the Lord now in 99 says one time he or she was a young and fair beautiful they had a lot of Temptations to go through but they they overcome that and they overcome now they're expressing the real beauty of Christ in their life and they're expressing through the mud Jesus gave us the example how to do it amen now we want to know how to overcome Jesus told us how to do it see humility he GED himself and took a towel and washed his disciples feet the very god of Heaven humiliated himself now we don't want to be humiliated and that's the reason women don't want their hair grow long grow out the the reason they don't want to dress L like ladies dress like men don't want to see the same thing they don't want to get humiliated but Jesus constantly look who he was greatness I'm going to say something greatness humiliates itself greatness humbles itself greatness amen that's you know you have the potentials but who wants to sign up for humiliation but that's part of getting uncomfortably comfortable part of part of what this revival is going to do is going to break down walls it's going to break down patterns where we can actually get outside of ourself enough that God can come in it's uncomfortable it's nerve-wracking I never thought I would be trying to speak or anything in front of people but praise God that God has some Potentials in the believer that he wants to stir up the gift of God that we can let God have his way and then he can produce just like what that little boy was playing hookie from school he had a little bit of bread and a few fish and oh he fed 5,000 amen just imagine the life that's in you the potentials can feed thousands don't ever lower your sights of the potentials that's in you you stir up that gift that's in you go and tell somebody of the love of Christ how you met him how he changed your life how he did for you exceedingly abundantly what you could ever think or ask or even imagine our God is great he's wonderful he's powerful he's Almighty he can break down shackles he can bring the love of Christ and where wounds have been he can heal up the wounded hearted those who've been broken for years and years and years years I'm a witness years of spine disease years of Affliction God rich in Mercy he come my way amen willing to be humble willing to be humiliated my but if he did that for us Oh my he had a purpose in doing it you know in overcoming we want to know what brother brandham taught because it's got to be something that as we're going through the Battle Ground as we're going through difficulties that these things have tried to take root in our flesh and then we tried to sympathize with it and we're saying it's not as bad as this and that and the other but we don't want no ground for the devil in our lives and so we want to recognize the devil and every one of of his tricks you know that's part of overcoming part of overcoming is we must keep life in us we must stay in Revival we must uh you know just walk by the word amen surrendering ourselves walking humility but recognizing the devil in every one of his tricks he said now the devil's not a thought you got to recognize the devil real and when you recognize him real he's not just a thought but he's a real devil and he's after you right but at the same time of recognizing that he's real and that he's after you you also want to recognize that God is in you and he's greater and more Mighty than the devil and his afflictions now if you know that there's something on the inside that is greater than any of your oppression any of your Affliction any of your bad thoughts any of your situations and circumstances then you have the answer right you have the Life of Christ right and it's a it's a guarantee of Victory amen we're not going to back up to the devil we're going to stand on the word yes God can't fail that's right he's able yes my God is able to perform what he promised I have committed my family to him I believe that the word of God said the same faith that I have I can believe for my house I take the word of God into my heart I claim it that's my promise I'm not looking at the condition of the current circumstances those are lying vanities like Jonah uh yeah Jonah he was in the well I mean there was a a a report that he heard that even Solomon when he was dedicating the temple he says if if there be people of God that ever get in trouble and you remember when this Temple was dedicated for the purposes of God you just call upon God and you'll be saved in the midst of your trial he looked this way it was big predicament Wells belly big predicament this way Wells belly I mean it was all around it but you know what he said these are lying vanities once more will I look unto the promised Giver I believe it and therefore I speak it amen and who oh my to think that God is hid in Simplicity when he goes in in this generation when they're rededicating the temple or the Tabernacle and the seals have been revealed and it's God in Simplicity God and man uniting amen and now you too when you're in trouble you can Proclaim and say this is lying vanities that's lying vanities this is lying vanities but once more I will look to the god who's present not Somewhere In The Ether but right here in me amen my God can deliver me and because he cared so much to make that prayer and that Proclamation God sent some kind of oxygen tank praise God he's a Creator I can't understand that and explain I can't explain how he healed me I can't expl but he did itall God kept his word and it's the same thing he'll keep his word for you just care enough to take him at his word testify to somebody M we don't want to go back and like it says 106 and start looking back and say I'm doing this and I'm doing that then you're defeated see we don't want to go and start pointing out all the things that we are doing wrong yeah we admit it put it under the blood it's just like it's just like in another place brother Bram said it's we're not going over here and saying if we're sick or if we're bound we're not saying well I'm not bound or I don't I'm I don't have TB I don't have cancer I don't have this and that no you have that you have that you acknowledge that but you acknowledge at the same time that as you're going through that there's a provision there's a God in Me That Is A Healer and he is greater and more Mighty and he will bring this body into subjection by his stripes I'm Healed you have the power of the Spoken Word by the third pool to take the word of God and put it on your lips and when you with a heart of Faith it's like deity speaking this Eternal Word when it's upon a believer that has a heart Sanctified and the spirit of God is moved on you and it's your hour it's your moment it's your time it's your deliverance God will bring it to pass we're expecting for it one testimony two testimony three testimony four who's next come on I want to see the spirit of Revival coming into the believer not the whole church just going through orders and no but IND individuals coming into the presence of God realizing they're an inheritance they have a joint they're joint HS they have an inheritance it's Incorruptible it's not just for the future it's for today it's for tomorrow it's for as long as we're here amen this notice in 107 says overcome the god that is in you is greater than one that is in him the God of this world is not as great as the god of Heaven which is in you no more than Darkness can stand in the presence of light now Darkness cannot stand in the presence of light I don't care how dark it is light will put it out it can't stand Glory but you take as much Darkness as you want and try to stand against the light one time see what happens that's the one that's in you is light and the one that is in the world is Darkness see so the light has proved to overcome the darkness and the man that's in Christ knows that he overcome the world the things of the world now he's talking about you amen he says the man that's in Christ knows that he's overcome the things of the world Amen there's no more ties to you at all you're free walk in the light as he is in the light and the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin and we have Fellowship one with another there you are he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world now if you look back you're condemned then you're still in the world but if you're living above that then he that is in You Led You above the darkness like the Lily he's above the darkness of the mud he's above the darkness of the Muddy Waters he is the light reflecting the beauty of that which put in him before he left the mud amen now I feel like shouting Christian Christian what was in there by God at the beginning it pressed itself way through overcome it overcome the shell it overcome the mud it overcome the waters it overcome everything and was an overcomer and reflected the beauty and glory of God Amen isn't that wonderful this Old Shell the mud you your upbringing doesn't Define you your presence stature doesn't Define you the waters the situations the circumstances the conditions that you're in they don't Define you the life that's in you defines you God has spoken that the same life that he that was in him it says in Romans 8 there is now therefore no condemnation to those who walk in Jesus Christ they won't fulfill the lust of the flesh amen my you know he talks about Daniel and mesach and the different ones examples I love this he says they overcome the mud that was around them and packed into them they stuck their head above those things and shine forth the glory of God that's what a real Christian does Amen I'm going to have to wind this down CU this is this is uh opened up a little bit more but you know I think that if we recognize our position like Jesus recognized his position you know he realized that you know he came to a place where you know he told Peter and the different ones he says now they're going to come and they're going to crucify me and he he knew that you know he he had to endure the difficult he had to stand the test because he was going to be the lamb offering he was going to have to give us an example that we can follow because we don't know the way we needed someone to overcome for us amen and so when we know that he overcome everything praise God there's something in our lives when we're facing it we're saying this is not unique to just me he overcame for me and he's in me now to do it again his potentials CU he's already done it once he's already proved that he's a he's a Victor over that condition he was tempted in all points like humans are in every way and yet he Sanctified himself my what a glorious thing but you know he knew his position you know and that's part of overcoming is recognizing your position is in Christ amen it's not this it's not seated in Christian Life Tabernacle in Bedford because God might have a season where you are planted and plucked up but you're still in Christ so it doesn't matter your what's your location no it's the condition of the heart your position in Christ we are now seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and you're here believing today because before the foundation of the world God chose you and he ordained you unto good works and so in order to work the works of Christ we have to overcome ourselves we have to get our ideas out because God is not going to use our ideas in his word and blend it together and make a big pottage no it's going to be him both to Will and to do of his good pleasure amen it's for everybody whosoever will let him come partake of the fountain amen but Jesus you know in that great Temptation he showed us the way and you know brother Brandon lays it so plainly and I love how he did it but when he was in Temptation what was his greatest Temptation well after 40 days and 40 nights he was hungry and the devil came tempting him you know and he said you're hungry turn these stones into bread why can you imagine like he already proved his messiahship you know speaking to the woman at the well he already you know multiplied the Loaves and Fishes he could have done that that's right no problem but see the Temptation was is to do what the devil told him to do to mine the devil and that's the same thing he'll the devil will come with his proposition he'll come tempting us but you were you come here to be tested to be tempted of the devil don't forget that you and I are come here to prove that what God planted is more than a match for the Temptation we might fail but a good sold gets back up say Lord I failed but you know what I'm not staying down I'm rising up I'm like that Lily and you know it was it was very difficult and maybe this is where I'll you know that this this does so much for me to think about the second assault That Came Upon Jesus you know he tempted him with the hunger and he told him the word of God he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word of God and he told him because he knew his position he said Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God and he was standing in the presence of his creator thou will not tempt the Lord thy God right there in that moment he was correcting the error and showing and proving giving an example that we can follow amen so in this second assault he said says just look and this is in paragraph 129 he says just look like the time goes so fast the next great assault that was made on him is that he would show off and how that does hit the Servants of God to be a show off show what you can do glory to God hallelujah I'm a deliverer I'm a so and so see come come up here come to the top of the mountain and said here he tempted him to do it now remember he was tempted to do it it's hard said now if you want to be something before the people stand here at this Temple and jump off see he he give you the scripture and as it written the Angels charge over thee lest you dash your foot at any time against the stone and he'll bear thee up you know the devil's going to use the word against you but you want to recognize your position recognize the assault of the devil to show his authority no true servant ever does that you see a man showing off his chest out and all like that just remember there is something wrong there no God don't want that Jesus set the example he could have done it he certainly could have done it but he didn't do it no servant of God shows off of himself or tries to take God's power and show himself to be something else somebody above I love this and try to take God's power and show himself above somebody else my I mean that that's a Temptation and the prophet of God is saying that that was a Temptation that he endured for us amen he gave us an example in 139 this is the third great assault Satan offered him to Forfeit the king kingdoms to him he did Satan said see these kingdoms of the world these are all mine do it I do with them whatever I want to I'll forfeit them to you but remember he was trying to get him to Forfeit it without the cross if he did we'd be lost he couldn't have taken the kingdom but he he must follow the he must come back he was tempted to do it death is a hard thing he was tempted to take his Liberty and be the king of the earth without the cross but if he did his subjects would have died Satan would have gladly made that proposition with him but he said get thee behind me Satan he didn't do it he come and suffered and took the hard rugged route he took the route of persecution he took the route of death are we willing to do this the same route that he taken are we willing to die are we willing to give ourselves to God forfeit all the world and the things to serve him my what a challenge amen we can breathe that one out my it's a it's a fearful thing to die but we must die and take up our cross he showed us the example there's a potential inside to lay every weight aside look to Calvary be energized stir up that gift you have the potential it's in you now he F willing to Forfeit Satan was to him but he didn't do it though Jesus was tempted he overcome for us he endured all Temptations for me and for you see he could have took it right then but what did he take the other route for so that we could come be with him if he paid such a price as that then how little would we be not to take it when remember there's nothing here anyway anyhow if you you lived a hundred years what are you going to come to mentally your mind gone you're all crippled up old shaky that's where you're going that's the end of it you come now overcome the thing how do you do it by the word what the word says to do walk humbly live before Jesus he endured all things for you and I he is our example how to over come our evil generation as he overcome his evil generation amen amen my oh this is just packed thick I didn't even get to any of my notes but I feel like we're we're definitely feeling a little bit lighter and I believe that the things that are on our heart we've we've shared and you know one of the things that I I just I feel like we want to be more sincere we want to be more dedicated to the the call of God and we want to call into remembrance like you know Paul was getting ready to leave the scene and he was telling Timothy all of these things you know don't let go of this unforged Faith this faith and just the definition that I had typed up here it says unforged faith is a sincere genuine faith and it's usually referring to to a young or innocent or trusting and you can't hide your feelings it's not with falsehood or pretense it's genuine unforged faith is pure and without hypocrisy it means what it says and its actions stem from a pure motive that's what he's telling Timothy and Timothy is now going to be pastoring and he's going to have to give charge to others he he saying you want to have like I've already showed you the example I'm doing this with a pure conscience there's nothing inhibiting the move of the spirit in my life in any circumstance right God is able to move any place any time anywhere he just needs a willing vessel and he's always had a witness in tormenting times in devastating conditions in ups and downs God has Witnesses and he's commissioned us we want to go into all the world we want to have this revival that people look at your life and at my life and says what meanest thou this what what is this what is the hope that you have you realize that there's this and there's that in the water do you realize there's mud do you realize there's the shell do you realize all of this stuff I've Rose above it God he's Draw Me By the Light of the day and I recognize my greatest enemy from the the Liberty and the freedom is this old man he's my greatest enemy but I'm telling you that God is greater and he's inside of me and he can do for you amen there is a sincerity and a consecration that I desire that we come into to where that we can be free to be who God called us we don't have to look to our neighbor and say I wish I was like them be who God made you to be be free to be the child of God that God Made You you rejoice I say again Rejoice God has brought salvation to us he's brought us the hope of a Rapture and soon and very soon we are going to see the king amen my oh my you know I think that I think this is the approach that you know brother brandom just has a way of saying certain things and I just wanted to share this maybe as I would close and just try to stop somewhere but maybe if the musicians could come and we'll just probably have this as a last quote you know a lot of times you know we have to overcome what people say like job job had to overcome what the church people people said he had to overcome what his wife said he had to overcome all of these different sayings of people and the way that we overcome is we have to have that singleness of heart you know I can't if if in my nature I want to please everybody well if I'm pleasing everybody I ain't pleasing God because I can't do both and so we must come into such a clear Focus like and I'll read the the thought but you know I I want I want to be able by the help of God to live for an audience of one and be okay with that you know if this person says you need to do this and you need to do that when I get into that closet with God and I bow and God begins to speak to my heart I want to obey that voice I don't want all of the other voices to try to manipulate me into moving I want to have a pure heart to know that God has told me thus and thus and I'm standing just like C I can't remember his name cartright you know he said God told me to have a Revival and this this troublemaker's come and there's going to be a troublemaker come your way so we need to get into our closet and know that I got a word from the Lord and I'm looking to the promise Giver to be a promise Keeper in my hour in your time of need amen but he says this in expectations in 1958 on May 8th he says once there was was a young musician who was trained in all the music that he knew how to be trained in he was he wanted to master it and there was a great concert and this young fellow was to play and after that he had got through his plane his master plane and it was Grand and all of the people began to stand to their feet and applaud the young man and was clapping their hands screaming and whistling but they noticed the young man did not even notice any of that he kept his eyes looking up and the more they tried to attract his attention by their screams and applauding he looked steadfastly towards the top of the balcony and at at the audience was amazed and the audience was amazed to see him not accepting or bowing to their applauding and they turned to see and up in the balcony was the old Master teacher he was looking up to see what the master said and he paid no attention to what the people around him saying if we would only do the same if we would look up and see the master is saying and not notice what people are saying heyen if we're going to have this revival if we're going to stir up it's not going to be a bunch of teachers a bunch of people telling us all of these difficults it's us coming in sincerity and saying God I want a Revival I want to stir up the gift of faith in my my life that you can deposit a gift faith is a gift of God L any and we need revelation God this I desire that these quotes would cause me to have such an appetite for Faith for new revelation new Mana it's part of the promise to the Overcomer amen praise God hallelujah you want to play something sis oh my amen maybe we can just stand together amen if you have a desire for God to touch your body touch your heart touch your life touch your mind and the Lord spoke to you and you want to say God stir up the gift within my life Lord I I realize that we're in a time where the enemy is trying to make us lukewarm and formal cold and indifferent but oh God you set a flame in my heart and I want to stir up that flame that gift of Life Lord that others might see like the lily and you want to raise your hand and you want to say God I want to live for you Lord I want to reconsecrate and dedicate my
