You're our healer father you're the one that brings life and that's what we're expecting father for our pastor and for Brother John and chowy and the family Lord sister Jeanie our brother Roger Lord surely there's sister Heidi still waiting father we just believe oh God cuz we're believers Lord we know that you're the only source of life and father that's where healing comes and so we commit ourselves to your faithful hands we love you and we thank you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen so good to be in the house of the Lord and I tell you it's wonderful to think about the love of God that gives us fellowship with the Beloved thank you musicians we certainly appreciate all of you and we just go right to the word of God and I have a little thought that I wanted to speak to you tonight Lord where is your Elijah amen you want to turn with me to Psalms 46 just a little inspiration thinking about some of the things that our pastor has been ministering on and some of the other brothers you know I I think it's an hour and a time where you know we really need to be in prayer you know I think that uh a lot of times people ask for vision and things like that and me being one of them but I believe that if we can go consecrated in prayer God would give us a whole lot amen real consecrated prayer for the cause I believe can move mountains Amen in Psalms 46 says this God is our refuge in strength a very present help in time of trouble he is always present our God is here tonight he's here to meet your needs he's here to meet my needs we're needy people and God is here amen therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and are troubled though the mountains shake with swelling their of sa there is a river and the streams thereof shall make glad the city of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved God shall help her and that right early amen thank God for that and if you want to turn over to Matthew chapter 17 we're just going to read a couple more scriptures and then we'll have you take your seats but there in Matthew 17 a familiar scripture in verse 10 it says this we'll give you another minute to get there Matthew 17:10 it says and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that Elias must first come and Jesus answered and said unto them Elias truly shall come first and restore all things but I say unto you that Elias has come already and they knew not that they had done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall the son of man suffer of them amen and one more scripture found in John first John first John chapter 1 we'll read those five verses 5 through 10 chap 1 John chapter 1 verses 5-10 this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and the word is not in US amen you have your you can have your seats we trust the Lord Lord will open his word to us tonight you know I I thought it was interesting it says if we confess our sins God is faithful and we know the scriptures and these are all familiar scriptures but you know I got to thinking about you know how God made man in his own image and God Made You and I creators amen you're living in a world you know we've heard the quote that says you know a man filled with the spirit of God can go create a world and live on it and I believe that's what we do every day every single day you're creating a world that you're living in how do you how do you make that statement brother well there's many times people they are doing like what they they would tell a you know like hey I'm going to have a misfortune or I'm always you know it's just this and that and I've always failed here and I've always failed there there well they're creating a failure to come amen but when we take and confess the word of God and God has something to work with then if we confess the word of God now God is a high priest that now makes intercession upon those things that you profess and what we're Desiring is to come into Unity of heart we want the love of God to constrain us to go and obey every word amen that's the Cry of the believer's heart tonight is to have a certain kind of atmosphere where God and man can become one and now God can come and materialize his word and flesh again amen that's what we want to be we want to be yielded vessels amen I want to be like a real handmade amen that's just just a little subject I wanted to talk about I believe that Jesus Christ Bride is a real handmade she just like Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word amen but this little inspiration came to me and I just you know there there so many things in our world in your world in the world that's around us that they try to get like our nature is sticky so there's things that try to corrupt and pollute our atmosphere and make us talk like the world act like the world think like the world but God has come to cut away and bring the Waters of separation and that we by the blood of Jesus can express the Life of Christ amen that we don't no longer say oh I'm just a sinner oh I'll never be this and that I'll be exactly what he said amen by the grace of God I am what I am you know and I just said like you know it it it's powerful to know that you're a Creator and you're creating you know there's people that you just love to be around why is that because they create a certain atmosphere you know no matter the negativity that comes their way they always try to find the positive in it amen that's what like what faith does is it takes the negative and turns it into a positive what he intended for a curse God brings and pulls it back as a blessing the scripture says all things work together for the good to those who love God how many love God tonight the trials the struggles the different difficulties it's working for good the circumstances doesn't dictate the goodness of God praise God you know but this atmosphere of prayer that's what I want to have you know the Bible says that pray without ceasing we pray continually I realize there's a lot of things that try to pollute our atmosphere but I want to keep my mind stay on the word of God I want to be in prayer I want an atmosphere of prayer that when God comes by my way I can just know God that's you that's what I believe God did in this generation brother brenham's walking and he' been praying some situation happened he's like oh God said just go walking and he started walking there was this communion there was this Unity there was Oneness you know the scripture says the sons of God are led by the spirit of God Amen that's what I'm expecting tonight I'm expecting the spirit of God to move not just to you know to fulfill my expectation that he's going to do it but God that you're going to be here to reveal what your expectation for us is amen I don't want it to just be one-sided I want it to be the two parts coming together ah God I'm here to serve you and your purpose not my will amen oh praise the Lord you know this atmosphere of prayer with the love of God in our hearts amen that's what I want I want an atmosphere of prayer constantly with the love of God in my heart amen because you know when when when that is in a reality it's not just a teaching or workup but this is something that is it was just out of Thanksgiving God you paid the price can you imagine if I still felt the guilt of my sin and my shame and but but he's come and he's liberated the burden of sin now I know that it was oh God you know it was God coming to display his attribute of Savior how can I know God in the power of his resurrection as a savior if I wasn't lost how would anybody ever know unless they been been sicken you know there's a lot of sickness going around but praise God our God is able to do for us what we need amen God is an everpresent help in the time of need amen but I I want to display something real a real handmade amen that's what the world is dying for is the love of God in our hearts acting and doing and breathing and moving not reacting on the negativity but acting on the word of God the bubble the bubbling Fountain amen I'm just here to open my heart to you and just let God speak amen we might be here for just a few minutes but maybe not you know you know they say uh it's supposed to be a special day tomorrow but you know it's just like Mother's Day every day is like Mother's Day you know we don't just worship Christ on Christmas every day is Merry Christmas amen every day God can resurrect and come in and be born in our flesh amen that's the kind of attitude I want to have every day I'm looking for the love of God to move in my heart to see the power of the Resurrection on display to bring my flesh subject praise God we might be looking and say it's a lot easier for that fellow but for me I want to to say tonight God let me be thy handmade amen amen this was preached in 1956 I want to quote to you out of the message love in 1956 on July 26 7:26 he says you believe in being led by the spirit of God I turned and started walking back passed on by a hotel and kept walking I looked at my wife watch already already seven I missed my limousine on down on down till I came down in a little color district and the where the color people sun was way down or way up that way yeahall miss my plane but something just kept telling me to walk so I just kept walking he says that's the way don't question God do what he tells you to do amen so I just kept walking and after a while laying at AR across the gate there was a little typical Aunt Jima with her man's shirt tied around her head she was tears running down her cheeks and I passed by she said good morning Parson and I said good morning Auntie walked on by I said well how she said Parson and I turned back and says pardon me a minute Anthony he says you called me Parson she said yes sir I said how did you know I was a Parson said I know you was coming I said you knew I was coming said yes sir she said I've been standing here since 4:00 and I looked at her I said well bless your heart she was wet on her back she said yes sir I've been standing here said do you did you ever read in the story of the shemite woman I said yes ma'am she's like she said I was that kind of woman she said I had promised the Lord if he'd give me a baby I'd raise him for him and said he gave me a fine boy she said Parson I raised that boy and when he got to be a man said a young man he got with some of the wrong company and he gone wrong and said he got a bad disease a Venero disease and said and he is in there dying and said two days he's been unconscious and the doctor man says there's no hope we's good family here we've never thought of anything like that he's dying he's backslid she said Parson I just can't stand to know that my baby's dying without knowing the Lord Jesus Christ you know I just I can't help but think about it the power of a mother's love The Power of a Praying Mother a a woman a mother a handmade that knows the Promises of God that's powerful Parson I can't stand to know my baby dying without knowing the Lord Jesus I said what Mother Love she said I prayed for two days and said this morning around 3:00 I was dreaming I dreamed I was talking to the Lord the Lord where is your Elijah he said I seen a man coming in a gray suit with a little bitty semi-western hat that's the way I was dressed my just think about it the the power of prayer to bring God on the scene Amen in a time of need oh my think of that he was a great fine boy there he looked about to be 18 and the blanket was over his hand going it's dark it's dark here I said what's the matter with him can't talk no he's been unconscious two days I think he he thinks he's out in a big deep sea he's in a dark and lost and the tears running down her big old fat cheeks and she said that's it Parson I can't stand to he that my baby died and had that in my heart the rest of my days that's that my baby was lost think about this you think about the situations you're going through but this real handmade of God did not want the testimony of her son to be lost she said I can't live with this kind of testimony why because the word of God promised thy house amen huh I mean there is something about a real believer a real handmade to take God at his word and hold to the promise she was there praying two days that boy was unconscious and she identified with the word I'm like that shite woman I made the vow and promise that I would raise him and I did so but he got around the wrong crowd I mean there's a lot of folks that we know that the environment the atmosphere has pulled people into the wrong crowd but we can be like this shemite woman we can be in prayer and we can go to God and we can know that he promised it you ask anything in my name and I'll do it we just want to have the atmosphere of prayer with the love of God in our heart amen you get so caught up in your closet you start speaking things you don't even know nothing about get into that channel where intercessory starts activating amen get so turned loose of this world we're not worried about the bills we're not worried about health conditions on our of ourselves if we're about his business he'll take care of ours amen I can't I can't to stand to hear my baby die and have that on my heart the rest of my days that's my baby was lost I thought baby weighed 800 180 lbs now but that was a mother's love no matter what he done he still he was still baby he was still her loving child I looked at it and I couldn't hardly choked back to tears looking at her and he was very bad he is a dying he's a dying Parson the doctor man said don't call him no more he's gone I felt his feet they were real sticky and I felt like oh you you how a person gets real cold and sticky and the feet felt cold well I guess maybe he is then so then he just kept pulling this and will you let us pray then auntie and she got down there and looked over me and and got the foot on I got at the foot of the bed and held the boy by the foot by the feet I said Auntie will you lead us in prayer she said yes pawson oh brother you talk about a prayer I just cried like a baby to hear that Old Saint and it was just quiet and cool said Lord Jesus she said last night when I spoke to you when you spoke to me your poor handmade in a dream and you told me that this Parson was coming and I know that my baby was going to speak to me and say he's saved before he goes I'm talking about an atmosphere of prayer like like you can get a confirmation in prayer that's what we want amen this is you know the scriptures in the Bible and the message is for admonition this is something that we can say if God did it for her God can do it for me you put yourself in the story amen and she was talking like that and the tears running on both cheeks and she got through praying she reached down to her apron and wiped her tears she said now will you pray paron I said yes ma'am and I put my hands over on the boy and said God my plan's gone and I don't know why but you told me to walk this must be the case I pray God that you'll be merciful to this boy and somehow The Sovereign Love of this woman praying for her baby you brought me down here just then I heard him go M mama she saides honey said it's getting light around here now I'm near the shore in just a few minutes he was sitting up in the bed amen that's what the atmosphere of prayer that's that's the kind of atmosphere that we have the potential to create amen I want to point to the examples there's power in your prayer it's the greatest it's the atomic bomb as we're going through in life we don't want to forget prayer we don't want to slack up on anything but prayer amen you know I just wanted to speak to you a little bit and just kind of tell you how the enemy just comes and tries to corrupt our atmosphere you know like we want the love of God to be shed abroad in our heart and that we can be free when when trouble come when times of distress when sickness Financial duress political duress all of those things we want to have an anchor that holds us amen that God said so and I he told me in prayer just like this woman God you told me your where's your Elijah that's what I want to know is where's your Elijah that's what you can ask not like well where has he been in history but where is the god of Elijah in your life in my life amen you know there was another atmosphere that I believe that brought the power of God down and this was out of a message in 1957 in June 23rd called believe from the heart but this is what he said he said then brother wood and and his brother and I we ran off to a place to fish again for a night a day and a night and this is on paragraph 130 and that afternoon sitting back there brother wood began to speak about an old woman that used to belong to the Anderson Church of God up there when they were in their Bloom oh how good said how how she used to take them little Jehovah boys and love on them and brother wood said to his brother Lyle said ly would it not be great if if we would go find that old sister and let her know that we're saved I mean just just just talking about the Lord and fellowshipping and all of the sudden you know when the B the woods boys were little you know they had some A Mother's Love or just another Christian know you know she used to just love on them and treat them good and special and that's what we should do we should treat each other with love and be you know you're special but he said now that word found favor with God after talking about God for a long time but that word found favor and those two Jehovah Witness boys both them aged men wanting to find that old woman and tell them that they were saved two brothers when they said that the spirit of God and his sovereignty fell on me sitting there in the boat oh I wish I could had the voice some way that I could sink it into the people's heart I could not no more control myself than I could fly to the moon and just by that word I said boys there's something fixing to happen it's a little animal of some sort it'll be brought to life there's going to be life connected with it and you'll see right away and I thought now what have I said I I begin to think of something what made me say that no vision it was just something spoke what was it it wasn't my intellectuals I couldn't even think of such a thing I was down below that it was in the heart that God came into he was going he was doing the speaking I didn't even wasn't even thinking of such a thing it spoke I think there is where Jesus said if thou believest in thy heart shall say to this tree or to this mountain then don't doubt but believe what you have said will come to pass you will have what you say there's my point get to the spot where it's something is not yourself it's something beyond your reasoning that speaks it out amen just think about your words and how you create because that word just wanting to go you know you think about us we're so mindful and you know we we make preparations and different things like that but this was not selfish this was going insane you know what what what you did we want to honor the effort and the love that you bestowed upon us amen that word them wanting to go back and say it was your labor wasn't in vain but that word found favor that the Resurrection Life came and resurrected that little fishy he said little fishy I give your life back amen that's you know oh we could just we could just say so much but praise the Lord you know if if you want deity in your midst welcome and receive the word you know the word of God is here to bring Divinity on the scene you know not just while we're in church but tomorrow Friday Saturday every day amen we want to welcome and receive the word we want God to instruct us what we are to do amen you know and I was listening to the message the way to have Fellowship the one our pastors we read in in 1955 uh October 9th but he says this and I thought it was it was wonderful you know we want to recognize those who help us you know you know God when he gives a man a wife he gives them a real treasure amen I know tomorrow is is a national holiday or whatever it is but you know I want people to recognize you know you don't have to be married to really Cher cherish and embrace and have you know a really thank you Mom thank you Dad thank you friend thank you brother you're a real help to me you know I see Christ in you yeah I see the handmade of God the servant of God Amen because I believe it's the will of God that we be thankful that we bring recognition when somebody HS us we don't want to be like the the nine lepers we want to be like the one that came back and gave honor and praise to the one who made the difference who brought the help and how is God going to do it we're a body F join together we want to bring recognition hey you really help me you're special in my life I appreciate you God's working through you in my life when God does something I think it deserves recognition thank you brother Joseph I think it was Brother Joseph Bose but anyway he was saying this in I think it paragraph eight but I'm not sure brother Joseph was talking about my home my wife if there's any credit to be given to any brandom give it to my wife amen that's right she's the deserving one 36 years old completely Whitehead a girl she never knows what it is to lay down she had a hard time in our country that's my hometown pardon me brother brandom CS he says that's where I was raised raised at or born raised at she tried this week with any price that she could give anyone who can come and watch Joseph while she would come up here and spend those last couple of nights with us I offered women as much as $35 $40 a week and let the a week of expenses if they would come and do nothing but take care of the children and we find no one M can you imagine this I mean Allie wants to do is just have or you know get me to come and spend the last few days and there was no one there to help but she's there burying it my you know and I I think that if you were in a situation like that it might Ponder your heart or mind to say well did I do something wrong is there is there something like huh uh you know why isn't there anybody helping you know surely and brother brandom he makes this statement he said so it's seemingly that the holy spirit is moving me away from Jeffersonville I'm watching for a place where he wants me to go Chicago will be all right with me if he moves me this way and whatever I go wherever I would go so I'm just in prayer you pray for me that I make the right decision but I can't hardly stay any longer it looks like other things too there's nothing no one's against me that I know of there's nothing no one's got against me that I know of you know it would be it would be wonderful if you would know if something if someone's got something against you then you can go to that brother like brother brandom's saying here if it was so I would be at his doorstep the next morning finding out about it but you know you find out that brother brandom he's saying it was the Holy Spirit that he was getting ready to move it wasn't the people so much is that God was getting ready to relocate him my you know but I I thought this was an important thing because brother brandom is invoking you pray for me and I'll pray for you you know we want to maintain this atmosphere and not jump you know just to conclusions on certain things but you know God he knows what he's doing with us and he's in control amen says this in 34 what if he held my sin against me what what an awful person I was but he loved me so much that he forgave me of for them when I was undone I for he forgave me he loved me a pure love and when Adam separated himself from the pure love of keeping God's word in his heart my think about that you know he separated himself and when he did that then he began those other faculties came in Malice Envy Strife hatred and so forth then when God seen that his children had separated he come down for Fellowship there was no one there to welcome him you know when he comes we want to make him welcome amen 35 he says look when Israel was divided up in the lands there was I believe in Gad was one of them or perhaps half a tribe they didn't go up to the promised land they stayed on this side the borderline Jesus visited that same people and look at the results of staying out of the full benefits of God's love when Jesus visited them when he went into gadera there was there they that's where they dwelt that's where they made that's where they came from right there and their attitude was still the same way because they it cost them a bunch of hogs to have a meeting they asked Jesus to leave the land can you imagine how carnal like some people they just they look at natural things as a value but I'm telling you you can't put a value on Revelation in the natural you know it's Revelation that brings your healing it's Revel that brings you life amen but they they had this attitude that was oh you know what hey the last time he was here it cost us a bunch of you know so they just started driving him out that was the Pharisees atmosphere you know we don't want to have those kind of attitudes and atmospheres influencing us but we want to know that they're there so we can guard against them amen but ah they didn't want nothing to do with it their they wanted their own ways and their own churches but they didn't want nothing to do with Jesus so they asked him to leave the land but he went on anyhow because there was one Soul calling for him just think cross that stormy Lake over across and find one soul in need and that was his love for that one needy Soul Hallelujah thank God that he's faithful even to One Soul that's what this service could be you might say ah you know what the God can come for one needy Soul tonight you just let that be you I'll let it be me amen he will leave Glory tonight he came from Glory tonight to this Auditorium for one needy soul that will believe him and so then when sin came in and separated man from fellowship notice what God did to bring man back act to Fellowship he introduced the world a blood Redemption God killed an animal and put those skins showing a blood Redemption and their God after being separated from his creatures God laid out the welcome mat back home by the shed shedding of the blood and then and that was then and has been been and always will be God's provided preparation for fellowship with him is through the shed blood I love the Simplicity of the Gospel you know you can look back and see you know the worshipper used to just slay the lamb but their conscience constantly was going back going back but praise God whenever the blood of Jesus comes it rids you of the desire for sin amen God has resurrected in my heart I don't even want to smoke I don't want to drink I don't want to do the things that displease him how do you know he's raised from the dead well I tell you I'm a new creature amen how many can testify Hallelujah my praise the lord well I was going to read a few more things but if U you have your device I just wanted to take a minute and listen to about 30 uh 40 minutes of a message and we might make a comment afterwards but if the brothers can um get this message I wanted to listen to he carth do you care and in this message if you listen and just focus in on it I believe that there are certain things that pollute our atmosphere that God wants us to make us aware you know overcoming is recognizing the devil and every one of his tricks and I think it's very important to recognize how he's trying to affect us as individuals and as a congregation you know the world tries to creep into the church but listen how the prophet of God comes to deal with our hearts in the conditions that we're in today so if the brothers will uh play from paragraph 51 is become such a thing until it's absolutely struck the nation and whole not only in Nation but the world and home many things I can say here but to save time the healing service coming up I I could speak at large on this but I won't I'm sure you'll understand what I mean this uh uh it struck the political world the political life the social life the moral life of the nation other peoples around the world it's got to a place the man wants to be a politician just to have the name of being a politician got plenty of money and can pull votes and hire machines to do it and and so forth Just for the name and worth millions and millions of dollars see just for the name of being some great politician enough has said it that you know what I'm talking about in social life that people try to get together in this insane social life don't tell me the world's not insane doing the way doing it sure is it's an erotic world and by the grace of God was only way we'll Escape it notice in this social life the people has come to a place that they they socialize little Clans and they get into there and think we're better than the next group see and it's just gun that way and it's the morals it's hit the morals of people until honest friends I don't even believe that the world the word moral is recognized among 90% of the people of this nation they don't even know what the world word moral means it's it's escaped from him and it's done it's so trickery Satan is very subtle see and he does it so easy so so subtle just a little teeny bit ear and a little there let he's got plenty of time so he just runs a little bit in here and a little bit in here and the first thing you know people just gradually move into it what would have happened of a woman uh back when I was a boy of 16 years old and she walked down the street like she does today in this strip teas Farm while they'd have had her in jail well if it was wrong then it's wrong now see but you see Satan just begin to cut off the skirts and to lower them down and and it'll come to pass that there somebody will Design One a little beyond the mackini or what you call the thing to a fig Leaf you remember that's right it'll go right straight back and it's it's there practically now and now we find all those things is because people are trying to find Comfort they're trying to find something that they and remember your comfort is your religion and you make those things your religion see what a Pity in realizing that death lays right before you think until all this has happened until it seems like that there's not a a solid foundation left in the nation to build anything on just let me ask you something you can't believe nothing hardly but the Bible we still have Christ thanks to God you you can't believe anything you get on for instance when you turn your television on you that have such and when you turn your television on and see the the commercials well if a person tried to live by one hund of those commercials you die in a week see you couldn't do it and the very thing that some company will break down like a product and say this is the thing here and don't have have this one over here and the same company sells the same product then another commercial come on take this on this side and not that in the same company the American people fall for such stuff as that till the whole thing is become a rot until there's no hopes at all nobody knows what to believe but I'm going to tell you after a while what you believe if you want Comfort he if the Lord willing the people they lie cheat steal tell you almost have to have a bond of security to borrow $5 from somebody it's uh you know the Bible speaks that that there be no love in the last days but just among the elect people that's right the scripture speaks of that that uh husband to be against wife and wife against husband children against parents just among the elected of the Lord will there be any love left the churches has got into the same thing out of social life they brought it into the church their social life and their politics and their other things until they've got the church so confused that it doesn't know what to do they brought politics into the church they brought also social life their social life in the church social activities uh bingo or Bunko what they call it and uh these suppers and dances and so forth in the house of the Lord amen why it's it's a pity they say well now that isn't that's on the annex remember it was the annex also that Jesus beat the the merchants out with their merchandise and said it's written My Father's House made a house of prayer and you made it at d the thieves see it's wrong I don't care where it's at as long as the church the church is not so much the building it's a people in the building and if those people are anticipating in this why it's wrong and they brought that practice now we find out that the churches too are always promising something like television and so forth that they never get to the the thing they promise is I all said an old quotation man is always praising God for what he did praising God for what he will do looking forward to what he will do and that ignore what he's doing see they they they fail and that's the way they become history after a while of the polluted see because they fail to recognize now you can talk of the Comfort Christ give once and say that a comfort he will give in the ages to come but refuse the comfort that he's got here now far you see it's on the same basis we find that which become a great thing I find out that there they come that's even becoming Pentecost in the churches it's become into the Pentecostal reals that there always a promising something that they never get to it it's always that every fell has a different sensation and and make it whether scriptural or not they're promising something that they never do get to it until it seems like it's got to a place to where there doesn't seem to be any sincerity the the people don't get down to that real kernel of sincerity it's lost the the very English word of sincerity has lost its its value to the people or by the people's way of of living it's lost its sin sincity to them now they don't seem to understand even to our confessions now I want you people that are coming or here and hold or on the the tape I want you to listen close now for a moment to this quotation it if you if unless you are deeply sincere and you cannot be sincere until your positive understand if you're presuming or guessing or hoping so then there cannot be a depth of sincerity that God requires it faith is not a hope s or it could be right it's got to be absolutely amen it's your ultimate it it it's your it's you're absolute it's a thing that you're tied to see you have come to your altimate that it is the truth and there's it's nothing but the truth and it must be thus and then when you realize that in your mind then you've got to approach it with your whole life soul body all that's in you just completely sell out everything to it as Jesus so uh graciously taught us in the man buying pearls and he found the one of great price and he sold all his others to get to it all the truths and everything that he had though they were good pearls he this one meant all to him and when you find God's ultimate his word a promise Upon A Certain thing you must know first that it is God's word that the thing that you're seeing being done is God there there's no there's no maybe so it could be it looks like it might be it is God now when you get to that spot then it's the pearl of great price you must get away from anything that anybody else tells you contrary to it you must not look to what man has achieved you must look to what God has said and what he prom promised and see him to do it then that's your ultimate right there then everything that you are everything that you was everything that you hope to be must be placed upon this just as though it was death and life to you at that moment I think one of the thing that keeps our people from being healed is the lack of confession is the LA of sincere confession now for instance this might sound a little bad but I don't mean it in this way but looking at my wife sitting here if I would go out here today and throw my arms around some other woman and and make love to her and I'd uh know then after I did that that I was wrong so wrong of course my comforter would keep me from doing that see see but I mean if I if I did that and I it had that I did it or anything similar to it and then I know the first thing is to say to my wife before I can say to God forgive me because I sinned against her if you come to the Altar and remember you have ought go make that right first before you offer your gift so I've got to go to her I believe in confession is straightening up also it isn't True Confession unless it is amen what if I said now I'm going to confess it that I done wrong I say good Lord old friend of mine you know that I know you real well praise God hallelujah I I I I think you're a good old fell uh forgive me you know old friend I I didn't mean it that way see I you say that's sacrilegious it is to make a confession like that it is but what if I go say uh uh Lord uh I didn't mean to do it just that way and you help me now I won't do it again he'll refuse My Sacrifice until I first go and make that right with my wife then what if I come to her with the same irreverence and say say old girl old friend of mine oh mother of my children old sweetheart you know we've been old Chums for a long time say what if I put my arms around another woman what do you say about old kid would you forgive me I imagine how she' look she' think what's happened to my husband now the first thing she wouldn't know whether I was kidding or whether I wasn't and you don't go that way to make a confession to your fellow man are God you go with the dips of sincerity with Godly sorrow of your Sinise Lord first you must be sorry I must tell her sweetheart come here it may mean the rest of our married life the woman that I live with it's my sweetheart and how I've loved you all these years but now you may leave me from this on you may not stay with me you may not accept me and I'm knowing that but yet to make it right I got to get right I got to tell her with the depths of my heart then I've got to tell God the same way and tell both her and God with the sincerity that I'll never do it again by the grace of God don't just really now I might be able to put it over her and she see well see maybe my speech to her would would convince her but my speech won't convince God he looks in my heart and he knows and after all just a few more years with her if God permits and we'll be taken out of this world but with God it's eternity so I must be deeply sincere with God and then if I am sincere he'll hear me but if I'm not sincere there's no need of me wasting God's time listening to me that's where it's come to today amongst people there doesn't seem to be that depths of sincerity that that they ought to have and I believe that a man or woman coming to be prayed for should first confess everything that they have did and make everything right because you see you notice lots of times on the platform you notice watch how far away that thus sayith the Lord is see see the people the vision will materialize of course with their faith God promised that by a gift but the healing is something different see God recognizes it then see now we notice that as the people making their confession has got to come with deepness of sincerity I have here I ain't got time to read it but is it beaming toon New York uh I believe or I got that wrong is Beamon I believe it's right the place where the anot shoe company is there uh Binghamton I believe it's called Bing bingamon that's right uh New York we was there in the anacott Johnson uh shoe place the big Auditorium and was having a meeting there and one morning Billy Paul was next door to me real cold winds blowing and I found among the people a lack of sincerity seemed like and I I wondered why here was one man that was heal purpose or one man in in particular I'm speaking of the man had a great Affliction and he was healed this night standing there and before we left 5 days the Affliction was back to him again see because in the presence of the Holy Spirit he took that off of him just like it did this young woman a while ago out here in the yard the young man last night see but there must be a deep sincerity to know that the god that can take it away from you now with that same anointing only he can keep it away from you see Hallelujah and then the Holy Spirit spoke to me one morning about daylight and said get up on the platform or somewhere and bring these people up there and make them confess everything that they've did before you pray for them the deepness of sincerity unless the world repents it's got to perish and confession is what the world needs today is honest confession it's like medicine for a disease we all can read on the bottle what kind of a medicine it is and what disease it is to cure but uh you know the reading the directions I'm going to apply that back to the Bible our schools and seminaries can read all the word but you know just reading the directions and how to take it it it doesn't cure the disease see it it's got the medicine so has got to be taken so a man can say I am a a theologian now don't speak to me I I I about such and such I know the scriptures I I know that the Bible speaks thus and th that he that heareth my word St John 524 for instance he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life or King James puts it Everlasting which is eternal rightly has eternal life because he's believed many people say they believe now that is true the the the scripture is correct I I'm reading the the the prescription or I'm reading what the prescription is I'm the antidote for my sin but can I take it can I believe I might say I believe but do I believe that's the next thing just read it and know the direction doesn't cure the disease the trouble is that the in our case we won't take what the remedy says do we got the remedy but we won't take it Hallelujah we say we do because we can read it but to really take it we don't do it see the gospel is the same way of medicine in this case if the patient and the remedy has been proven to cure the patient and the uh patient reads all about the the uh discovery of this drug and they know every ounce of medicine that's in it they know all the the scientist name that found this certain drug like the salt vaccine and so forth if we if we know all the world about it but refuse to take it it won't help us see it it won't help us but and then how we say but we've tuck it and if you say you tuck it and the patience shows no results he didn't take it that's all how if that clock on the wall wasn't such a busy body see I'd like to say here and bring down real strong for our our people since the gospel has been proved these things and they claim they take it and they show that they don't take it how can a person read the scriptures upon the little thing that talk about about women with the bob hair and wearing shorts and so forth like that how can they call themselves Christians when the very medicine itself says that it's different hallu see how you said but I danced in the spirit I spoke in tongues that don't mean one thing your own life proves that you didn't take it Hallelujah Glory you said you you took it but you didn't for you still are showing all the symptoms that the medicine is supposed to cure that's right and the medicine in the gospel line is a guaranteed cure it's got to be now you see you got to show results you take a person says that there I am a a Believer I believe Let The Gospel Light Strike them brother they take it right now and they'll show results certainly you'll not see that man in any more pool room you not see him out he with a cigarette in his hand you won't see him drinking oh no you won't see him flirting with other women no no no I don't care how much they throw their female flesh before him he'll turn his head towards the skies and look towards Christ what is it shows that the remedy took effect and if it don't take effect you say well I know I took it well then where are you at today then you're dying you show I'm looking at you as diagnosing your case by the by the Bible that you're still in sin and the wages of sin is death don't think it has to be made any pler see your own actions prove your own actions prove that you didn't take it you thought you did that's right heyen you you might have been all sincere in doing it but you didn't do it for if you did God promised it would take effect on you and the old sin is still there the old Adam nature still lingers there the old unbelief yet you try to make yourself before your fellow man say well I'm a Believer Oh Glory to God yes I'm a Believer but you see it didn't help you any maybe the patient itself wasn't even predestinated to the medicine if it didn't it'll never take effect hlj seeu but look at that little imar woman when the light struck her there was something laying there to take care of her condition if we believe and sincerely confess this remedy of God's way or takes effect God has a provided way for these things now see man will go say well I join the church that settles it with me that isn't God's provided way God's provided way is repentance confession and showing a results bringing forth fruit meat par repentance showing sincerity if you people that just do that this morning is going to be prayed for are and you people will hear this tape all over the world and after this tape is played and the minister of the person is playing it in congregation groups out in the jungles wherever you are that's playing it well first make your confession clear and then come with nothing in your heart at all but faith and be prayed for it there's the medicine will take place Jesus said repent every one of you I mean Peter did on the day of Pentecost repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost when you thoroughly repent and believe on the Lord and are baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you make God a liar if you don't receive the Holy Ghost if Jesus said this the last commission to his church these signs shall follow them and believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover and you see those signs fallowing a Believer and you come up and that believer lays hands on you and something doesn't take place then there's something wrong with your belief see the believer God promised a provided way we try to find Comfort but saying I don't have to listen no that's true you don't have to listen to it but if you are predestinated to eternal life you will listen to it and you'll Rejoice to it it's your comfort it's a thing you've longed for all your life it's it's Pearl that you're you're ready to forsake everything hallah you want it because you know it's God's loving care for you it's something to settle the sin question to settle the unbelief to settle everything to you if you want it it's he that's really sick and knows he's sick this hunts a physician not he that's not sick doesn't need one Jesus said but it's those who are sick if you can realize your condition then you've got to do he said do then it's got to take place or God told something was wrong see so many people sometime healing Services you don't start from the bottom of it you've got to get our life cleaned up You' got to be in condition you've got to really say yes I believe it and that's got to be from your heart then you nobody have to Baby around say now oh brother dear sister dear you ought to do this you ought to do that you're a Believer there's nothing can take it away from you I don't care what anybody else would say what any consolis what any uh comforter what any doctor what any Hospital what any diagnosis and say you still don't believe it you just know it there's no need to say anything else about it you know it now that's the genuine thing we have so much impersonation in all things it has to be that way don't feel bad about it it's got to be there it's always has been and it will be but I'm telling you this morning what's truth and facts we're at the end time we got the lay this thing down at the truth and let it know what's the truth now um we find out that people won't take God's way about it they won't they God has a way provided for your comfort God has a way provided for all these things but people don't want it people go after other ways and every time they do it some other way besides God's way they bring the wrath of God up on them every time they do it all right and all these things that I have spoken of it brings us to this the world all of these going after other scientific achievements going after church achievements going after different things has brought us to the end of the world we're at the end there's not one hope left we are without a hope of survival we haven't even got one chance of survival now just let me break this down just for a few minutes and just prove it to you and each one of you you get if you don't you ought to get a medical journal you ought to take the reader digest and so forth where you read these achievements now to make a minister here is sing this message around the world to make a statement like that it we're without hope that we are Beyond Redemption that we have passed the line between uh uh Redemption and judgment now I must give the congregation some grounds to base this statement upon there must be some reason that a man if he's in his right mind as I think that I am uh would make a statement like that to tell his Nation to tell his congregation to tell the people where it'll go around the world and 30 40 different nations maybe around the world and peoples and languages that we're at the end time it behooves us to give a statement or or or explain a little of it till we get down to our main text for the morning look now let us look what science and education has brought us to and that's the very thing that man accepted instead of the word of God right a scientific approval and Sciences always have to take back what they said I was reading years sometime ago where a French scientist said about 200 years ago or 300 rolling a ball around the earth and said if this ball at this speed uh if the world ever invented some kind of a something that would make them the travel at least 30 miles an hour something like that around the world that he scientifically Pro it that it on its weight would be lifted by gravitation from the earth now you think will a science ever refer back to that guy certainly not that's an app pass to them now let's just think now we all want to say I want to scientifically prove it that's what a lot of denominations of religious people say they they want a scientific proof well I could turn right back around and say scientifically prove me God in your congregation prove me anything scientifically that's real prove what is real life I want you to get me a quarter's worth of it or or let me sell everything I got to get that part of life and is life real if it isn't what are we all here for life Faith love joy peace longsuffering gentleness meekness patience science can't touch it and that's the only real lasting thing that there is the whole Christian armor is looking at the Unseen but the senses don't declare those things but they're there that's the reason it takes Faith to believe it and it produces in you what faith has declared is out there it brings it to you Divine Healing and things they can't prove what heals divinely but they know there is a Divine Healing uh they can't prove what saves from sin but they know people are saved from sin so it cannot be proven scientifically but it is scientifically in God's way of looking at it now what has science brought to us now you may be shocked just for a moment science has brought to us sickness death and diseases now you're only being taught one side of the picture but there's two sides to it amen hallelujah you say science has invented this that and the other well we're going to grant you that privilege but let's look at the other side science has brought us sickness science has brought us diseases death look scien I ific high breeding has brought death to the generation of foods and things it's got the people so uh soft and so until the the man and women are made up out of a bunch of muck and there's no there's no there's no structure in it it's become a bunch of soft jellyfish amen hallelujah they can't live without an air conditioner they perish they can't play a baseball game when them gets tapped somewhere kills him in the boxing rings and what more and So Soft to man and women oh it's perverting them and they're injecting this H bre into cattle which has come back into mankind now according to science himself and is making perversions out of them because when a a cow is hybr or any food is hybrid that food makes blood cell and blood cell is your life see what it's done and then into meat they inject these your injections into the meat and now it's prove that these injections take effect upon the human race scientific they spray the fields with this DDT I seen the other day and now we got 800 sick people in this community from eating eggs do you remember years ago when I first when we had the little bitty structure here and I was prophesying and said it shall come to pass in the last days don't live in a valley and don't eat eggs I've got it on my book I thought there something about that and went and looked at it don't eat eggs that was way back in 193 3 Lord EGS has got something in them now and I see where science says that a man over 50 years old should never eat an egg because it's the hardest thing on a heart that can be eaten diseases milk it used to be our most balanced diet was milk the doctors will tell you stay away from it it's making scientists and everything else it's the same human being that used to drink it and live for years and never know science but the in breeding and so forth has broke down the structure of a human being till it's nothing but a bunch of mock b a ball of sickness what done it science look it's caused the genes between the the man and the woman to weaken the physical weakness of the human being through the genes and the increase of children is around 30% Mongolian is is on the great climb and these weakness of interbreeding of the foods that we are eating for life is weakening the body which causes cancer mental troubles and all kinds of diseases is setting upon the human body because its weakness scientific destroying themselves getting away from God's plan he said let every seed bring forth of his kind Hallelujah see where we're at I could go on and on are times getting away but notice what's it's doing it science has brought death sickness and destruction and I seen the other day I talking to my good friend Dr ve sitting here there were there's an article that people getting killed a penicillin it really isn't a p penicillin it's a filth that they let get into it when they're manufacturing the penicillin it's a moneymaking greed [Applause] scheme doctors giving it sometime who don't even know the farmer of an aspirin and the father sends them away to get a a specialist and something and other and don't know even how to cure a tummy ache for a kid but what have we got greed some pull a little something they don't have harly anymore the oldfashioned country doctor they used to get down and talk to you and console you and do everything they leave God right out of the picture am because it went after their own ways in order to get God out of the picture they explain him PL away there we are that's what we've done by in breeding you see the body what makes a healthy plant a germ can hardly get to it it's these hot bed plants these hbrd plants you have to keep sprayed all time and many of you read my message on hbrd religion keep it sprayed and baby and and so forth notice but the real genuine plant don't have to be sprayed he's an original what makes disease come to the H human body is the body is I'm told by a precious doctor friend of mine that I wouldn't want to call his name right now but he's a very fine Brother reading to me recently out of a medical journal a book in his office where he keeps All These Fine books of the latest stuff on medicine it is weakness you notice anybody that's real you say your body's run down you take a coal right quick what is it it's a weakness of your body it produces a mucus out of your gland and in that the cold germ beds itself and you got a cal but if that body was strong it would throw away that cold germ it couldn't touch it so you see when God uh constructed a man in the first place he was immune from any disease see but unbelief and science science and education was the first thing to took a man away from God and it's still taken him just look what cigarettes and drinking and these strip teases and so forth has done to the decline of this generation I guess you always wonder I'm going to make a statement here I wasn't going to do it but I believe it will amen see I they Wonder sometime they always telling me brother brandom what what makes you always picking on things like that you don't hear it say you go to a man's church I can take my women folks and they can't even in Comfort where you're speaking you're always balling them out well about your short hair about wearing clothes pertains to man and all these things like that say why do you do it now I I I'm this may be my last message till next summer you know but I want to tell you amen there it is it's a spirit of discernment for this last days that knows that that's a cursed thing before God I just wonder sometime a Minister's got any discernment of the last days the very God that tells on the platform here the conditions of you what you've done and and what is going to be and and what troubles you got that same Spirit within you looks out and conern the signs of time and it can't keep from crying out it's a spirit of discern because the Holy Spirit himself says that thing is sin and whoever partakes of it perish and then how can I be justified in the sight of God and seeing my sisters and brothers in that kind of condition if I don't call out against it even though they get angry with me I still must call out against it it's discernment sometimes they different in the word and so forth It's lack of discernment come face it down by the word see see we we know that's right well it's it's a no it's a truth it's a discernment of the last days now we see about science I I don't want to go any further on that my time just get so running away now let's take a second look at education see what it's done see now we have two churches at large now we realize that it was that it was reason common reasonings that started the ball of sin rolling at the first place it was reasoning what reasoning against the word of God when God told Adam and Eve the day you eat thereof that day you die that's settled that's all of it and he fortified them against the enemy behind his word but when Eve listened to Satan's reasonings see culture understanding education advancement that's right see she stepped out behind there and listened to Satan's reasonings and did the thing that God said don't do and if one reasoning listening to One reasoning against the word caused all this chaos one reasoning against the word again won't take you back to the same place because how foolish it be of God to bring man back upon the same basis you send him out from see see you've got to come to the shed blood of Christ your denomination won't work and your reasonings won't work it's the blood and birth and it produces in you a new creature Christ and after the fashion of Christ you live because the toxine that you take shows it kills the sin of unbelief against anything but the word of God Amen education give us that we got two churches at hand this morning one of them is the Church of Pentecost that was organized at Pentecost by the Holy Spirit the second is the Church of the Roman Catholic which is organized in N of Rome one of them is a spiritual uh birth the other is the intellectual membership from that church come all Protestants all denominations come that's the first denomination all denominations come from that one and are relation to that one Revelation 17 says so she was a and she was a mother of harlots right so there's no pot can't call K greasy see because it's it's right amen it's just one it's organized it's gone it's in Rome I don't care what it is it's gone the Bible we've just come through those Church ages to prove that one is based on spiritual discernment the other is based on education and intellectual conception now that puts us right back in the Garden of Eden again right back the same place the woman church was the one who listened not Adam the woman now want to be mother Church go on it's exactly right there's nothing out of time they make their own confession see see right back to the same thing to disbelieving the word of God at n Rome when the question come up about water baptism about other things like that about the baptism of the Holy Spirit the the Bishops all together organized what was called the Roman Catholic Church which was Royal Roman it was called just got through taking the history yesterday and listen looking over it again and it was only to be for Rome alone in Rome was a royal Church others are just little sister churches to it it's called Catholic our church is also the Catholic Universal Church which is a a universal belief of all believers one of them is borned of the spirit of God and has the holy spirit in it and it proves by its life Doctrine and action that the Holy Spirit ends in there because it's a comforter that PRI Christ promised working in his church doing the same thing he did at the beginning am amen that's how the toxine of Christ salvation worked in the beginning that's way it works today brings forth the same thing the other is a interal conception of a denomination made up by a group of man amen which has a form of godliness as the prophet told us and denied this truth of power that's just as plain as I know how to make it now there is the two church one of them was born at Nia and the other was born at Pentecost and and one has always been against the other we come through the church ages to prove it one's against the other one of them is a fine dignified intellectual church with fine Scholars and so forth the other is class is a bunch of Holy Rollers it was at the beginning drunk illiterate fisherman and it's the same thing today it's still classed in the same category one of them is scientific the other one is spiritual one is scientific Arrangement the other one is spiritual discernment of the word one is scientifically arranged what groups of man says intellectual Bishops the other is absolutely born of the spirit of God and lives by the spirit of God and it performs and makes come to pass the words that God promised shows what toxine you're taking have you got educational toxine have you got the Holy Spirit toxine am all right all that subtleness of Satan how he can paint that picture intellectually can make a man that's not born to the spirit of God just turn around and around and there's no way intellectually to down them with it there's not a way it is a discernment by faith a discernment we see what the word says we believe it then brother Brandon they say they have the discernment then let the Holy Spirit produce exactly what he promised to produce then we believe it there's the evidence of it how did the toxine act when it struck the person these signs shall follow them that believe he said if the toxine struck that then that's all right amen praise the Lord you can stand with me you know it's one of those things that I like to get the word unadulterated straight from the prophet you know and I think that it's an hour where there's so many ways to deceive and be de you know to deceive and be deceived but praise God where is your Elijah you know God has sent Elijah to come and to divide the darkness and the light and so we're so grateful and you know it's just important that we maintain an atmosphere of prayer and the love of God because when we do that I believe God gives us Revelation amen and those are the things that are going to come upon the land that are all now manifesting we see there's an intellectual church that was born at NAA Council and but there's also a born again church amen you know and I just love the example of that shemite woman even that woman Aunt uh Jima you know she she was there and and I believe it's it's those that are sighing and crying for the Abominations done in the city I believe that God is going out now and he's marking and sealing those who are there in their prayer Closet in intercessory prayer and you know sighing and crying so let's be about our father's business and let's pray one for another we just uh we're getting ready to
