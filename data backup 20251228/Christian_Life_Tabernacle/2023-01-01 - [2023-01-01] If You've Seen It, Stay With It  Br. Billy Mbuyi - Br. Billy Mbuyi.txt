knowing that he's there for us to lead us every step of the way to just have an unfold himself in our life and to recognize it as a privilege knowing what has done for us every day amen Happy New Year may the Lord bless you we're going to invite with it some Souther to come at this time and open in prayer and there's still a song reading [Music] [Music] morning good morning Happy New Year Mike there's quite a few less of us uh this morning than there was last night it was a blessing to be in the house of the Lord and that overflowing it might take communion together with the saints of God we're going to read a short Psalm this morning but we're sorry you get second string or third string once again I enjoy brother Mike's uh study and his teaching and uh you know it all comes from inspiration of the word and I've often said maybe uh wrongly said it's words to live by it's really not words it's word to live by and we just leave that word appreciate what Brother Andy said last night because she said we take it back to the message at the hour and make sure what we're telling people is the word not just Main bablings and encouragement even they can be fitly spoken but when it's the word it does something for us and uh I would say my intention as it is every year is to spend more time in the word there's benefits and blessings and whatever we have need of it you can open God's word and you apply that to your life it's beneficial and uh you know because you can see without or you can look without seeing you know seeing um kind of gives indication that you're perceiving something right you can you can talk without voicing what you really feel you can hear without listening but we want to be fervent in everything we do and when backed up by something that's alive it makes us more alive amen so I would uh certainly encourage those that are looking for a miracle by this little passage of scripture I want to refer to um you know there's times when you see someone come to the Altar and you think well I really prayed that they'll get their blessing they'll get their healing they'll get their miracle and you feel a little checked you think well if God does something for them he's not going to be able to do it for me we serve a great big God and there's no limit to what he can do and I was reading two different places is covered uh at least two jairus's daughter you know he was a ruler of the synagogue the Bible says and he came down and fell before the feet of the Lord and worshiped him and prayed that he might come and touch his daughter his only child about 12 years old the Bible says she was at the point of death and the Lord says I'll go and he starts making his way to the man's house and there was a great throng of people that surrounded him and he couldn't hardly make Passage and that's when the woman with the issue of blood that had also sought the Lord touched him stop the crowd he says oh somebody touched me and the disciples got and said Lord there's many that touch you but he had perceived that virtue had gone from him he knew someone had gotten their healing and it became evident she had to tell everybody I've searched for years I couldn't find an answer but I had faith and I touched him in the process of that time of all those people somebody came from jairus's house and says no need to trouble the master your daughter's dead you know don't go on over there Lord says only believe only believe and he proceeded to the house and says she's just sleeping said he was going to go in and wake her and they laughed him to scorn think of it but he took his friends his companions his children Peter James and John and the parents of the child and went in and he awoke her from sleep God's not short on time we're short on time we press we move we we scatter about we have a lot of idle time but we always wait to the last minute to get things done but God's always on time so I would encourage you to press in amen and realize that there's no shortage in God's goodness I Just Want To Praise Him and exalt him and be thankful that we do have a place to come set aside for worship of the Lord and if we overflow these walls and we're building a new one next door we'll try to overflow it as well but may this be the the Year of Jubilee for all of us it's going home time let's read together Psalm 100 just a very short psalm we can read in unison there's a couple things in there that uh really are a blessing but I believe the Lord enjoys hearing joyful praise in the midst of Trials troubles sing to the Lord sing the Lord with a loud joyful voice if it's like me it may not be on tune or on key but amen hopefully it'll be motivated by a lot of joy and Thanksgiving hey man let's read it together make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands serve the Lord with gladness come before his presence with singing know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his pasture enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise be thankful unto him and bless his name for the Lord is good his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations amen really amen God bless you I have your seats let's sing the song this morning I'm going to meet him in the air amen CFG please meeting in the air amen you have

we don't deserve it but it's your goodness that's brought us here Lord and father your scripture is being fulfilled this morning that we he who started the work will finish it your scripture is being fulfilled this morning that we are the workmens of your hands and created in Christ for a good work that you are working on Lord God we hear not because of our own Perfection but because of what you've done oh God and and father regardless of which way we look at it we always come back to the same thing that he who started the work will finish it and because we realize that their sufficiency is not of ours but it's your sufficiency it's your word it's your doing it's you always coming on the same Lord and father that's the celebration of Believers it's never about what they can do it's always about the Fulfillment of what God wanted to do since the beginning we invite you this morning to just come in our mids Lord and I pray father that if there be any sick among us at home wherever they may be Lord that this may be a new day for them or God and Father if we come here and we have trials no doubt Temptations and trials and problems and all kinds of things Lord may you make this a new day Lord where we lay our burdens down and we take your burden that is light and we move forward and say I go forward in the name of the Lord Lord just come and speak to us this morning Lord we're not here to entertain oh God we're here for your word we're here for the reality of the Lord Jesus we hear from the reality of the word that you promise in this end time therefore we commit ourselves we remember that you just continue to bless our past to continue to strengthen him oh God and make him well we love you and commit everything to your hands in the name of Jesus we pray amen amen amen are you happy to be in the house of God amen I feel like we were here just a moment ago hey man let's open our Bibles we want to wish you all happy New Year amen will read some quotes and some things and I will try not to be too long this morning amen welcome all our visitors God bless you this morning let's open in Isaiah chapter 60 verse 1 to 3. a very very familiar scripture reading I mean it would say arise and shine for thy light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for Behold The Darkness shall shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness to people but the Lord shall arise upon thee his glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and the king and Kings to the through the brightness of the rising let's just bow our heads to our father we ask that you bless your word once again to us in the name of the Lord Jesus we pray amen amen you may be seated man before we get to our subject I just had some uh courts and some things that I I just had in my heart about the new year and I'll just we'd go through them quickly so we can get to our little subject this morning and move forward but random will say he says here tonight uh it says here tonight to hear those testimonies and it says that the different expressions of Thanksgiving to God and I was thinking about us in light of what just happened last night and you know people will give testimonies and we'll say about the things that that went through the year and the things that God had done for them it says and expression of Thanksgiving to God for what's been what has been uh uh what has been to uh it what has been to them through the past year and I want to join my testimony with them I was thinking the sister back there says testify of of the bread upon the water and then it says and then the brothers and brother Slaughter and brother Graham it says talking about uh when the wheels of mortal life also all stand still it says maybe misunderstood here but uh There Before the Throne God knows all about these things it says so we're just here tonight uh it says kindly I don't believe in turning a new page or something like that it says just turn it yeah just turn it back to the next day but it says but if we'll if we'll just come and give ourselves to God to worship Him and thank him for all what is what has been to us and ask him to continue to be with us is just about the best amen so he's now just telling us it's not necessarily about turning in new leaves but it's just about the recognition of what God has been doing you know when you really think about our approach of a Believer when we talk about what God has been doing it's not what he's been doing since your birth or since you you you you receive God and then you begin to walk oh my it's so it goes so far beyond that it goes so far beyond what we can even comprehend what we see what we don't see to understand that everything is being orchestrated until this moment yeah that's what brings us in such an awe of the god that we serve when you come to an understanding that he knew all about those things and yet he's Gathering us together and then he would speak in the message context it says now it says the beginning of the new year I want I want to say not happy New Year to you but I want to say this to you God bless you and then it says if if he does that he says that will be that will have all that we have need of for this coming year and I trusty will I I believe we need to know that we are blessed people we're not left alone and and God comes around and and and lets us walk and then figuring out if we're going to make it on our own and then comes drop a little blessing here here no the the fact that we know God is a blessing the fact that we walk with him is a blessing the fact that every day we we we recognize who's the source of our breath and who's the source of our strength and and that we walk by him we talk by him it's a blessing to come in that knowledge and he doesn't even have to do all much but just the fact that you understand that everything that you have comes from him is a blessing in itself and then he says I'm by his grace it says we are trained this next year he says if he shall spare me spirit means spare you by his grace I hope it says I hope I'm a better Pastor next year than I was the year before I hope I'm a better servant of Christ it says I'll try I'll I'll try to live closer it says more truer to bring the message as he gives it to me it says I will bring it to you at the best that I can without not it says withholding nothing that he could that he would want to give it he says I'll do all that I know how and it says I know you feel the same way so when we come and and it's the end of the year and it's those things one of the things it's just you it's the expression of the desire the bruised within the hearts of a Believer when he you come to the realization and yet we are and then yes another year that God has added and we are here for a reason because if it was God was finished with us he was not going to add us another year but if he gives us another year is because we still have work to do if he gives us another year is because we still have battles to overcome we still have challenges to overcome we still have to walk into this Perfection that is laid before us so as Believers every time we are given a chance even the scripture says why you still have breath in your lungs you one to come before God with sincerity you want to come before God with this resolve that I'm here to believe your word and to do all that you have laid before me to do and and it says here the the Earth is cool enough and and we know that the spirit is speaking and the church is cool enough and the Revival is over he says you don't know what come next but we trust that God we trust the God for that whatever it is we know that God has an answer for it whatever it is that's before us whatever it is that we need to do we know that our trust is in the Lord that he will guide us step by step he says another place he says as we submit ourselves to thee this morning the beginning of a new year and ask that you will fill us with the Holy Spirit and I'll say this as a Believer you you just never get to a place where you say well I have enough Holy Spirit I don't need no more my every day you just want every fiber of your being to be filled every morning when you wake up you feel you need more than you needed the day before every day you want to be the kind of believer that says that you'll be so much hand over to the hand of God that the devil doesn't know what to do with you and that's what we're walking towards and I'll say this some of these things the prophet is saying him this is even after the opening of the seals you would think uh the peak of his ministry the greatest thing that ever what God promised he opened the seals which was the cap of all the things but yet the prophet is coming and saying that I'm looking forward for more I'm looking forward for what God is going to do next I'm looking forward for what he has in store for us so as a Believer we have to be people that are motivated to want to see God move to want to see God use us to want to see God perfects our life we can't just settle and say well you know I'll just walk with what I know God I want more of you than I needed the way the day before it's the desperation that brings it to come to pass it's when you come to a place where you realize there's more to conquer the promised land I'll say we haven't even touched the things of it of what's in store we want to explore every corner of it and that we can possess every bit of it that God has given us he would say it says not turning a new page it's it's it's it's turned to the word he says see what the word promise for today see what the light of the day is possessed is supposed to be it says we ought to do this what we ought to do this year is not to go back to Creeds and things go back to our denomination not to go back to the old denomination and I want to say this oftentimes when we hear this our minds goes to denomination well go back to Catholic no it's going back and being settled in what you know it's being oh I've heard this before I understand what the right messenger is talking no it doesn't want you to be settled he wants you every time you open the word you're looking for fresh manner you want you every time you read the word every time you listen to the word you are very attentive to what God is wanting to speak to you at that moment not to come with a mentality well like I've listened to that before I've heard it before I know what he says I know I understand what the message is all about you're missing it if you come with that attitude but what an attitude to know that I'm here attentively listening I know I have a situation that's that's today I have a need for today and God is going to give manner for today I want to say this the prophet is gone but the message is here to answer to the need of 2023. you say he was preached in 1960s and all of those things but yet there is a part of that message that we can use and he will answer to the need of today through all the nomination by turn back to the word and see what kind of what kind of light is supposed to shine today and then he says oh Church turn to the word get back to the word he says flip the right switch quick uh it says quick punching around on electric light and and see artificial main man turn to the word and see the promise of today and then see what the promise is and watch for it identification for watch for its identification when it's Vindicated then you will know whatever you are whether you are in the light or not see what it what the promise is you know that's why the prophet will come to say God is not interested in building boats today because it's not the identification of today today even as we sit here all the message has been wide open to us and so marvelous that we've come in such a focus and we know every day we work our best Believers of this message we know exactly what God has promised for us to be in this generation we know that we we are waiting for our body change we know that we are waiting for that Rapture to take place anytime we know we are waiting for the manifestations of the sun we know we are waiting for that bride to come unto action and to begin to do the Greater Works that she was promised we know we're waiting for that to come so we are not distracted by anything else we are not distracted by a message of of popularity or message of of riches and to to build better kingdoms here on Earth and we're not interested or in the gospel of how to make more money or how to live better and how to better your life and be healthy and all those things we are interested in something that can produce a body change something that can produce a manifestation of a true son and a daughter and and it's what it brought us in such a focus that we can look at those things he says to me I want to see what the promise for today what's promised for today I want to know what the light of this hour is so it's bringing it even from a a day to an hour saying what the promise for this hour is so I can know what to walk in it says I want to know where where I'm living what age I'm living in and how far up the road am I oh my how far are we how close are we the scripture says if he doesn't come today you'll come tomorrow they were living under the expectation that any time that promise will come to pass yeah we're living under the expectation that any day the bodies will be changed they were living under the expectation from the first stage they thought they were the last age and God will send another message in another but now we know according to the revealing of the word that God has bundled everything up and we've come and we know that there's not another Messenger to come that there's not another light to come that God is coming as you open up the whole book and and we are living in a time where he promised that what we have heard will change our bodies try hey man it says soul for the new year be determined to stay with his word and what is promised it's not a determination to go and Conquer everything no I I'm just determined to stay with the word if the word says it that's all I want to stay with if the word promises that's all I want to stay with it and to do that you have to know what the word says and it says like the the like the other elect did in other age in other days it says or he says if you feel like you've you've seen the light that's broke through upon you of the Lord Jesus Christ his manifestation of his grace and and the Holy Ghost in This last days it says remember remember stay with it remember remember stay with it if you have seen it stay with it and this is you're going to go into what I'm about to just preach this morning if you have seen it stay with it and then he says it says what he did it says you and and the other elect and and what he the elect of other days like in the like like like Abraham and when they saw it it says when when when it was all against when it was all against scientific proof Noah saw it when it was all against scientific proof Moses saw it when it was all against uh scientific proof these smart ages don't gone by but the elect saw it and stood firm uh so it's not what science can prove it we're not here walking by oh science said this then we're believable or something that the messenger said and you wait years after years and oh you see the car someone driving a car without the driver then you're like oh no I believe it because I see it no if you have that kind of attitude you'll miss it every time the Believers that are saving every age are those that always believe it before it comes into manifestation they believe it and they hang on to God's word and they are saved those that wait for it to hit their eyes are the ones I always miss it those are the ones that are always waiting and waiting and wait you wait for too long but oh if you have seen it with your eye if God has revealed it to you walk in it don't let it go stay with it believe it until it comes to pass because The God Who reveals it to you is the god who's going to come to bring you the power and I think that's why we failed most of the time because we think it's our intellect that makes us believe it is not your inner life it's something that God placed within your heart from the foundation of the word that believes the word without any scientific group God believes the word without any explanation that believes the word when everybody else is running from it that's what brings it to pass because the same God who made you believe the same God is going to come and vindicate your faith to show you that you believe the true thing he says with determination not knowing what the New Years hold but we are holding to him the word it says the word that knows the whole he says the word that knows the whole Symphony from the beginning to the end he knows every movement in every Junction we don't he knows we don't and then he says God stands on his promise on the promised word for each year or for each new year he stands on it this year to fulfill what has gone what God has what is God promised for this year whatever it is I want to be right in the center of his will I don't want to be caught outside I don't want to be caught at 10 believer well I'll believe more when I say no whatever it is I want to be in the center of God's will I want the world to come find me believing everything I want to believe everything that he said right from the center of it I don't want to come in by the permissive will I want to come in by the perfect will I want to be in the perfect will every moment I know he can work out the permissive will but I want to be in his perfect will Hallelujah if we can approach if our approach for the New Years will be that it says for the New Years is is in for the New Years so for the New Years is determined by God's word just determined to stay in his word and he he says in in the message Shalom he says Shalom God speaks be upon you and when God's word is Vindicated in the age completely and you see it and you believe it Shalom to you I love that that's as simple as I could ever put it if God's word is Vindicated in their age it Vindicated completely it Vindicated and you believe it and you see it Shalom to you meaning peace be upon you you it's done you don't have to worry about it anymore you don't have to worry about how this is going to happen how is that gonna happen if God's word is been made visible to you if you believe it with all your heart Shalom to you be peaceful why because The God Who fulfills because remember God is in the business of bringing the manifestation of people may try to work out the manifestation at every Junction they can they see something in the word and they work it out they work it out and they work it out I'll tell you when men do that they always come to a failure but you believe the word and God God's manifestation come upon you when God's manifestation come to nothing can change it nothing can deny it it comes right after the Faith from believing comes to you it says oh God lead us by thy Everlasting hand until Victory is finally won he's going to give us the victory we don't have to go look for victory he's our Victory he's everything whatever challenge you have he's your Victory he wants you to know I have victory it says and Jesus returns through the Earth seek it says sin and sick and sorrow will be ended and will will leave will leave this glorious we'll leave this glorious Millennium to these and we are we are longing for the for the for the great day come Lord Jesus that I were today getting that we get get into and and and circumcise lips and speak and hearts and hears it says may the seed Fall Into the Heart where the Holy Ghost will sow it and bring forth a hundredfold we are asking in Jesus name and that's our prayer that we may come to a place where the seed falls into the ground and I want to say this it's important that that seed falls on the right ground the problem is never with the seed but if there is unbelief found in your ground you know I I this just came to me as I was studying and and it just hit me so hard and you know oftentimes we wonder well you know they were in the message how come they believed they just believed it and then how come they walked out the ground was not all Faith together there was always some unbelieved sword somewhere it was always something but oh the desires of a true Christian is God remove my unmalee take my unbelief away that when the seed of the word comes I don't want to be found with any unbelief I want my ground to be clean and it's our job to take care of our ground and when we come and we meet something that we don't understand we take it to him and say God give me the answer take my unbelief away I know your word has power to do it so the seed there's nothing wrong the seed will do what the seed was promised to bring but oh God if you can take my hand leave away and I want to say this is this perhaps where my inspiration came from and but when I'm speaking in the same message Shalom it says now what about the new years we are facing it says we could have more to say on this between the the the darkness and the light and to introduce the light coming between uh the the light coming between but we know we want to get right straight to the new year he says the new year the New Year what about it is this bringing New Hope he says we are it says we are one year closer we are one day closer and then he says we are one day closer than we were yesterday we are one hour closer than when we started it says 15 minutes to 11 it says 15 till 11. it says we are one one hour closer we don't look back we look forward our pastor even mentioned we don't look back we look forward he said and I want to say this uh this came and I'm not sure perhaps I've read this before I was thinking about it this quote that I I heard it came from uh the this lady the color uh Harriet Tubman and this from the Underground Railroad where they were rescuing slaves and they were helping them to run and and and things like that and she she made the statement that I taught it's just been on my heart for a while and and she said and this is uh when they were helping this slaves escape and all those things and she made the statement and said to those that were running it says uh if if if you hear the dogs it says keep going and I want you to think about your life and and the enemy and the trials and everything around you if you hear the dogs barking you say oh I made a decision for God oh wait and hear how many dogs are gonna bark at you it says if you hear the dogs keep going if you see the Torches in the woods keep going oh I see I I believe but now I don't understand confusion comes which direction do I go if you if they are shouting after you keep going don't ever stop keep going and if you want to taste if you want a taste of Freedom keep going if you want a taste of Freedom keep going and I would just want to speak children of of light children of Light walk in the light so I want to walk in the light keep growing if oh I don't understand keep going or I ask God but it doesn't happen I waited and now you keep going I don't see it clearly keep walking if all you can see is one step before keep walking if all you can see is uh just all nothing and just a little bit you keep going if you can't see keep walking if you think there's a wall keep walking if there's a wall leap over it and keep walking now as you read a rise and shine and it says for the light is coming and and the prophet will use this and to preach the message Shalom and and he will use this to rise and shine and and as we read it for the for the light has come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee so here he is he's saying arise and shine and and he's saying oh you that come now I want you to understand the description under which this come because in the next verse he's talking about how there's Darkness upon the face of the Earth and and he says and gross Darkness upon the people and he says yes the condition under which you are in but he's saying to you arise and shine arise and shine so in other words whatever condition you are in in the condition of Darkness God word is here this morning saying arise and shine you say preacher you don't know what I'm going through and you don't know the challenges before me and you don't understand how much I've tried he's saying arise and shine he's saying stand up and go stand up and shine don't don't sit down keep walking keep standing up keep walking keep making one step at a time whatever it is it says keep walking you said well I have unbelief in my heart I say this morning stand up from your unbelief and keep walking I I have a a condition I that causes me to find myself in the same place and it seems like I'm running into circles all the time I said stand up and keep walking arise and shine and and I want to say this the word goes and I want to say this when he says arise and shine for thy light has come I was thinking about this even as the uh the prophet will talk to us in the message uh uh uh the God's power of transformation it will say that oh God will come upon the face of the Earth and it was all the spirit of God moving and the Earth was without form and void and he says it's the same word it's basically the same manifestation when he says let her be arise and shine and him saying letter B is basically the same thing so when he says letter be the prophet comes back and he says the sun came out the sun dried up the water the sun the sun warmed up the ground and the sun called the sea to come to manifestation and the seed believes the gospel that the son was preaching and the seed came out of the ground and manifested one whatever was already in it now when he says arise and shine this is not an empty call this is not a call for you to wonder how am I going to rise out of all of this in other words God is calling because there's some ability for you to respond to the word in other words if you hear this morning arise and shine if you hear this morning that the word of God has gone forth arise and shines so God provide his word to us this morning and he's telling us that we are free we are to stand up and walk we are to to be free this morning and to stand up and walk from whatever condition we are in so when we speak about this word arise this is what the translation in Hebrews and all fourth means he means to arise or to rise it means to uh uh to stand it means to stand up excuse me it means to stand up it means to be established be confirmed be fulfilled so when God comes upon Dark Cloud he's here it comes to a time where there is gross Darkness upon the people and darkness upon the earth when he says arise is basically telling you it's time for you to come to fulfillment it means to be set it means to be fixed and I like this one Eli it means become powerful become powerful and it means come on the scene and God says arise is calling you on the scene he's saying that now I have recognized the time that you are living in I've recognized the darkness that's upon the Earth I've recognized the condition that the world is in now I'm here with a message called Shalom and I'm saying arise and shine and I'm saying this is the time that the Lord has chosen for you to come on the scene and he says it to come on the scene it also means it to come into manifestation to come into the calling or the manifestation of what was promised to be and like I said it's very important we realize that God cannot make this call unless there was an ability for us to come to it and God's words that's calling you that's what is giving you the ability for you to rise and shine so I say this morning get out of whatever you are in let's get out of whatever we are in let's not judge ourselves powerless let's judge ourselves powerful why because that's what the word of God has called us my brother my sister it doesn't do you know good every time the word is preached you run it through your mind you run into your intellect and dig and and take it and work it out and divide it and and see how much portion of it applies to you no what we need this morning is the hearts of believing faith and mind that will say if the word of God says it I believe it and I'm going to walk in it thank you arise and shine now it says in Ephesians 4 and 5 and 14 it says wherefore he said I wake it thou I sleepeth and arise from the dead and Christ shall be with shall be shall give Delight it says therefore he says awake thou that slippers this this bride has been sleeping this this way the scripture who says we were uh dead in sin and trespassing we were once the children of disobedient but oh the word of God has come to arise you to move you out of that condition into the light and the word of God is here to bring you out of whatever you are in so he could bring you into the light of God and the prophet will go and it says for the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee in other words his glory is honor his abundance his Splendor God has chosen you to be here in order for you to manifest his arising when you go and you begin to look and when the prophet preached this message uh perhaps we won't have time to just expand it or go a little further in it when he talks about the world's condition and what we see how how what's happening it says there's Darkness upon the face of the Earth and and gross Darkness upon the people oh the prophet will summarize it and I says this is the most deceitful age that there ever was this it says gross Darkness upon the people it says we we live in a time he expresses it one place and he says we have people that even know what they are doing is wrong but they can't help it I want you to think about that for a moment you know that what you're doing is wrong but there's nothing you can do to help yourself out of it and the reason is because they rejected the light I came to get them out and this morning we have to be careful when the word of God calls us that we don't get stuck because remember the call is not forever when he calls you have to respond you and when you cause you have to quickly grab it you don't have to hesitate take it whether you feel worthy and worthy whatever condition you are take the word of God if there's something that needs to be done for him to clean you let him him do the cleaning don't clean yourself just take the word oh I I don't care what condition I mean I'm taking your word for what he said if you call me to arise I'm arising this morning now it would say darkness and it says time where men are trying to be like women and women are acting like men and and oh my we can go where there's no definition of what it means to be a woman it's being debated people oh they don't want to be uh uh oh I don't want to be man or woman I don't want you to call me he or she I'll choose that to whatever day I wake up and how I feel that day I mean this is the basic biology that can never contradict itself this is not some science where you need to sit down and teach someone and do some calculation this is the basic decency the the human basic understanding is being lost in people he talks about rumors of wars and wars and all those things this is the day that we are living in he says blind miserable rights and naked don't even know it he talked about men thinking evil continually oh my we won't even have time to go through all of it he will talk about how this is Satan's Eden that we are living in there's nothing good to be expected it's not it's not we can't come here and say well you know perhaps the economy will get better no they they whether it gets better whatever happens with it we know it's going down the drain they say they're all quiet for peace and safety it says when they do their days damnation that's about to come right after that now now God is using that age he's using a time like that to come back to his people but you he says to you Shalom to you that have received the word of God in other words it's in time like this it's in the condition like this that the word is coming to you and saying Shalom and peace be upon you it's in time like this that the word is coming and said arise and shine and let me say this if I can just for a moment my brother my sister it's important that you don't live by but you don't live but the economy of the word of the world is sorry because if you do you go down with it it's important that when the word of God says this that we separate ourselves from all the things of the world because anything we associate with that's of the world will go down with it because the word of God is here telling you that you don't have to do what you're doing you don't have to continue in that direction you don't have to be one that's bound and feel like oh I gotta do this and I gotta do this to survive when the word of God says arise and shine in that arising and The Shining that's provision for everything amen I want to say this and the only way we can get to this arising in my shining is to let the word Direction is to take the word at every opportunity we are given is for us to let ourselves be led by the spirit of God and I know we have to work we have to feed our families we have all those things to do but oh if we can understand this morning that there is something that's greater than you feeding your family that's something that's greater than you keeping your job and keeping the lights on that he who says arise and shine he has all that you have need of when he says arise and shine he didn't say arise and shine go get to do this go do that go do that and then come to me and then I'll tell you what you're going to do next no when he says arise and shine it's the giving of ourselves into his hands that he may direct everything that we are going through because I feel like oftentimes we let the things of the world stop us even the prophet will say we're not our jobs we let those things we let God but God is saying I understand you have to work I understand all of this but I'm calling you to my word in my world there's provision for you oh if we can take him at his word this morning amen oh I say this in the world that's in complete chaos and complete total chaos and total darkness I say this it's the word that gives us eyesight it's this message that helps us to see without it we won't be able to see anything let me say this this call of arising and Shining went forth but how many believed it how many received it they they they they the word went forth it was just music through the ear it was nice to their ears they continue in the economy they're continuing the things that they were doing they continue whatever but you are here this morning because you heard this call of horizon shine fry oh to the Believers I want to say the world's condition is given for you to you to know that's a sign it's a sign it's important that we understand that's a sign the scripture will say as I say this as I was going to say we are the children of light and not the children of Darkness children of Light walk in the light now we it's it's him I've always felt like as a Believer there has to be certain things that cannot be uh confusing to you or certain things that you have driven us take down that you can never come back to change anything about it there has to be some markers some testimonies some things that whatever however far you go that if you come back to those things you know for a certain that this was what God had done for you now when the scripture says ye are the children of light I don't want us this morning some looking at this and says well I don't know maybe I'm a child of the darkness you can't do that you said how do you know I'm a Child of Light because you're sitting in his house this morning how do you know because you heard the Elisa call you heard the message of the hour and let me say this if you heard it and you are here this morning if this message means anything to you you are a child of a light let's not confuse it let's not take what we are and mix it with the challenges that we go through let's not take what God has called us to be and mix it with everything that happens every day if you are able under the sound of my voice do not recognize that God sends us a messenger in this end time you are a child of light now you may have not come to the reasoning or to the full light that you're supposed to you have not come to the realization of the the full benefit of being a child of a life but you are warned because God has given you an ear for you to hear it God has given you an ability for you to listen to it God has given you ourself for you to see it not everybody sees it but if you can see it because you are a child of light [Applause] and and that's where you begin you say God I I know I don't understand everything that's in this message but I know for a certain that this messenger came from you I know that what he preached is your word I do I know that what he said you will come to pass I've seen some of it come to pass I don't understand others but I see some what of what he said come to pass you are a child of a light and I want to see when you see that continue to move forward you continue to make steps forward yes oh my the scripture will speak and it says in Matthew Chapter 5 and 14 it says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill and cannot be hit neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel of a bushel but on the camp but on the candlestick and he giveth he giveth light unto all that are in the house it said let your light so shine before man that he may that you may see your good works and glorify your father in Heaven and I think the challenge around it it says oh my good works in everything well you start by believing you start by walking in it and then your good works will will glorify the Father the good works doesn't come in Day One the good works is heed good works the good works is his the more you empty of yourself the more you feel it with him the more his good works will come to the front the more you let him take hold of you your more you let him work on you then his good works will come to the front and then he will say in first Thessalonians 4 and 5 it says but ye Brethren are not in darkness and and you have to say this within your heart I am not in darkness I mean the light it says that ye should should overtake you with uh with uh a thief it says ye are the children of light and children of today we are not of the night no nor of Darkness this is very clear this is very specific this is not confusing this is the word of God telling you you are the children of light and and you say Oh I wanna I want but when I'm says if you have an inclination if you have a bit of a self or part of you that wants to serve God or part of you that wants to please God if you have even any little bit it says then you work from there and you let God make it bigger you know I was thinking as I was meditating on this and oftentimes people will come on the prayer line and they will come and the prophet will stand there and he will lurk them in and it will some of them will come and there's no faith at all but yet this is the messenger I don't want to say this it was just not a messenger but we understand that this is the ministry of the son of man which means the Lord Jesus Christ himself was making himself known unto his people so they will stand there and he will begin to try to raise their faith and by doing so he'll tell them where they came from he said you live in such and such a place and this is your house and this is this and you will tell them of the condition that they were in you are here you are you have such and such condition and everything now what is he doing he's Shining Light before them he's giving them an opportunity to see the light and the moment they see the light the moment they see the light they says you believe that you believe that he said he says now if you believe God keep on walk King keep worshiping keep praising God keep doing this I believe that's the same thing the message that's to a Believer we come and he calls us to say a sinner and all of those things but when we stand before him he began to look at you and says now I'll tell you something you were not just here but you were with him in the beginning you were with him I seen you over there you were with him even before the foundation of the world and you begin to see something he began to form something he says do you see that then continue to walk into it but it gets bigger as we walk in it but if we are sidestepping today we are in it tomorrow we go out it's it's going to remain at that size we want it to grow so we can become a bigger reality and the only way to do is to continue walking in it walk in the light as he is in the light it says the blood of Jesus Christ will wash us of all unrighteousness he's the one who's taking our righteousness away where do you know we come to church and we are dressed right and we do and oftentimes many of us look like holy you know they are dressed and all those things that's not what interests to us that that has no zero bearing to anything what we are interested in is something inside of your heart recognizing the word of God and walking inside of it foreign will say he says now it must have been about that time that Satan looks over at the top of the hill and after it after it goes dark he says sitting scare of the light he's scared of light any devil is afraid of light that's right any creeping evil thing is afraid of the light it says you take a wild animal in the jungle of Africa or out hunting out there he says you flush the light they are gone they are scared of the light you get an old Nazi nasty roach and throw an apple core down out of somewhere when it's dark it will come out around the nibbling just turn the light on and watch him take the car for cover certainly spiders and everything else will take off it says they are afraid of the light that's the reason people are afraid of this old-time Holy Ghost meeting we don't see it because we are not given the ability to see in those dimensions but it's not you you the light we are being attracted says he's the manifestations of Crisis manifestation has attracted your attention but others they look at it and say oh I don't want anything to do with that they looked at it they they they they didn't want anything to do with it but to you it's attracted you he says they are afraid of the light that's the reason people are afraid of this old time Holy Ghost meeting Children Of Darkness work in darkness children of Light walk in light he says ye are the light of the world a city set up on the hill he says don't put a bushel over it now and and I believe that's my inspiration if I could say it this morning don't put a a bushel over it don't come in this morning and and always looking down on yourself and your inability to do things and always looking down on yourself and always being negative at every corner oh it's my fault and it's this and it's this and it's this no don't don't keep doing that what the prophet is encouraging us as children of light to do is when light has been shown out to us it's for us to claim it I I say this I oh I can't wait until the day us as Believers will walk in the house of God and when he's speaking of his promises or when he's speaking of those things we are not looking down at ourselves but we are letting the word from the image of what we are walking into we come not for condemnation but in the realization that I've been saved I've been born again and what the word is saying right now is just my inheritance I'm here to you about my inheritance everything that's for me I'm here to know about all that I need to conquer in order for me to come into the full maturity that's the attitude we need to have we don't need to come and feel like well they're going to call out my day so they're going to call out for this well if you do all those things it's you wasting the opportunity for you to walk into the light let me say this Facebook is not going to bring you into the image of God our games playing games and all of that the news is never going to get you into Rapture condition tell me somebody who's been gotten ready Enoch was not ready by listening to the Daily News oh Russia is at War today and not the world economy is going down those things were never given to get you ready for the Rapture those things were given as a sign to you that there was a word that was being sent to Abraham and his family that was saying to Abraham that Abraham will receive that word and that word was sent for a body change the body changed us in coming the economy of the world the body change come in the revealing of the word foreign let's stay in it let's talk about it let's make it our daily meal let's make it every opportunity to eat it why because that's the thing that's going to change the molecule of your body you know how it will start it will change your heart to begin with it will put the love of God within your heart it will make you love your neighbor he'll make you love your enemy it will make you do good to everybody we don't need more mental understanding what we need is the world to come and create the love of God in our heart yeah that's the manifestation I'm looking for I'm not interested in adding up more quotes and quotes and quotes I want what I've already heard and what is revealing to me to come into the reality ye are the light of the word of the world now I want to say this the scripture says in John that the life was the light life was the light so before there's a light but before there's a light the light comes from the life so you get the life you are the light now he says Jesus is the light of the world and he says you are the light of the world so in other words the same life transfer that was in Christ that life has been transferred to you and that causes you to be light and and let me say this light is for the illumination light is to expose the air when the world is going in such a condition where there's air every day your life speaks about a light or a kind of life that has to be the right kind of Life your light is there to guide people in darkness says you stumble all the time but in light you are able to see where you're going so when the world is in chaos God is Raising you up light is the source of life amen do we really have that understanding and the heaviness of that is when we woke up every morning to say people live because of me if you are the life if you're the light that that becomes your responsibility may I say the prophet say that if the elect are taken up the what's left is the chaos I believe I hope I'm not saying anything new a kind word a help going the extra mile Discerning the needs that's what in front of you the ability to project the love of God the ability to have that sensitivity to know what is it that he wants done with the word are we walking with the awareness you know one of the things that we always run into and I believe this is the trick of the enemy is to always keep us busy with our own problems oh I got so much I have no time for nobody else you know I got so much in my list is so full I go back to bed and I haven't finished what I was supposed to do the next before the day before while my list is piling up but is that really what we're living for is that really what we we hear God are here it's a sacrifice to come to church but when I'm calls it a reasonable service it's a reasonable why it's one who's coming to an understanding that my presence here means something my presence in this building means something to somebody I may not know it but to just be able to see faces oh a fellowshiping last night we'll see people that I haven't seen in times and everything to just just to look upon them something raised from the heart that Joy came in the heart to understand that each and every one of us your life means something your life is not in vain God placed you here to pay to play a role God placed me into this church to play a role I'm just not here as a a checklist or or a person on the list that we can count well we had 300 people it was included no that I'm here for a purpose I'm here to be manifesting light I'm here that my life May mean something to somebody and I'm not just meaning for the church body but the world we have to come into the realization that I am the light of the world and if I am the light I'm the source of life for many people but when I most speaking he says he was I was reading this about about Enoch the scripture says in Hebrew 11 and 5 it says for by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God has trans had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God but without faith it's impossible to please God for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him diligently not just any seeking a diligent seeking an Earnest seeking a desperation one that understand the importance of that seeking and I think that's what allows us to move forward to grow and to mature is when that diligence comes into place where as a body we begin to function as a member altogether the understanding that I'm here not just as a member in particular but I'm part of a body and I'm playing a role I'm here to be a light to somebody else you may not say much it may not you don't need to come and expand the Bible and then you become like no your very presence your very essence your very just nature your very everything it brings something each one each one we don't have a testimony equal to another each each one of us has a specific manifestation and characteristics of Christ that no one else can project each one has a testimony of things that Christ has done that no one else can match to them and so each part of the building will talk about how God is building this building with Lively Stone and it says that each Stone will come and fit perfectly into the building will say in the walking the light in a message that Tata Church it says Lord Jesus we thank thee for these messages it stirs us it says looking that we are not ashamed but we have kept the faith and I pray it says God that this spirit will continue to stay in the church Keep Us close to one another father keep us with you it says Walk Among Us Lord in the last Candlestick age that we are living in because be our light shine forth upon us it says this great time of Darkness Lord we re for we realize that candlesticks uh the candlesticks and stars speaks of darkness and Lord we are glad we are the children of light walking in the light of God we are not Earthbound with these things of the Earth but we are children how we thank thee for these things it's something to Rejoice about when you realize you are children of light there's a responsibility that comes with it it's something I Rejoice I know I'm in the position to do something I'm in the position where God has blessed me in order to affect something he continues on and says we thank you we thank you for sending these messages as confirmation of your word may you always be honored Among Us father may you keep us okay may you keep us from all bitterness of the earth keep us Sanctified to our lives well till our lives will pour and will be pure and clean and holy before you he says let the blood of Jesus Christ do this for every one of us Lord it says it says uh we says take take from us if there is anything that's not of you right that's not right it says take us from Lord take it from us it says Lord this is the hour of searching time these meetings these meetings meant for that purpose to search our heart you set them flames of fire your eyes search how to know the reins of the heart certainly do father and then it says speak back to us and tell us telling us what how it makes make yourself ready that your hour is arriving but when I'm talks about a story of perhaps if the musician could come and I'll close around here he talks about a man who who didn't believe in Divine Healing I'll read it quickly and the man comes to him and says one time I was down in Kentucky and I was having a meeting and an old fellow came out and said oh I don't believe in healing I said well it's your right you are an American he said I don't believe anything unless I see it he said well it's right it says it's all right it says now I ain't got nothing against you but I don't believe what you are saying but when I'm responded it says it's your own American privilege you don't have to now I never accepted nothing unless I can plainly lest I can see it plainly it says well that's good for that's good you must you must be from Missouri it says I'm I'm a Kentuckian who it says it says don't sound very good as I don't sound very good contagion but I said anyhow I said that's the way you think and then that's the way you think go ahead it says how how are you going home he said I'm going across the hill I live over it says we'll go we'll go over me it says nice man it says go home go home with me and stay all night said he says I wish I could brother but but I said I'm going up uh with my with my uncle and he said you want to ride over I said no I got to go up across the hill up there and this way and down the holler and up and and and down over there and he said how are you going to get there he said I'm going up the path listen to this why I said you can't even see you can't even see your hand before you I said how are you going to get out there he said I got a lantern he said I said and I said what do you do he says light that Lantern and then walk with it he said yes sir I said when you light that Lantern can you hold it up a higher like this I would like to see your home he said you can't see it so from where he was standing to where his home was even if he would hold the lantern in front of him he would still not be able to see the home now I'm one that don't believe that these are just stories this is a message in a nutshell this is but random will preach well preach well preach and then we'll give you one example that summarizes everything that he's been trying to say I said he said I can't see it I said then how are you going to get there oh he said I'll just light the Lantern and walk and I walk I walk as the light it says I walk as the light I'll just walk it says I'll walk just just I walk just as the light does he says I just do that just walk in the light so in other words he's saying I'll just put the light in front of me and as the light is shining I'm seeing the steps that I'm making and it will lead me home and I listen to whatever it says now it says just keep walking I know he says don't stand still you never you never you never get nowhere you'll you it says if you if you've been saved walk to sanctification you say how do I get there just keep walking now and I think this is this is this has to be very critical because don't ever get this courage and stop the stopping is what the devil wants you to do and I don't care at what level you are the moment you stop moving that's what the devil is looking for the moment you stop you're gonna regress there's never been anybody who's stopped and never went anywhere this is this is moving this is a movement that goes forward the moment you stop he calls you back the moment you stop things that were behind you start creeping back in things that you taught you had overcome they start showing up why because you stop it's from sanctification to justification from justification to sanctification he says in the baptism of the Holy Ghost after sanctification how do you get that just keep walking in the light the light is provided as a path for you to go you keep walking in the light the light will take care of what you need the light will provide the path for you to walk in oh I want to say this morning is the start of a new year I don't want to ever stop I want to continue on from wherever you stopped with the Lord you can you take another step you continue to walk you continue to walk why because he's the one who's taking you to the Finish Line if he provides the light he's going to continue to provide a life and you keep walking in the light that is provided speaks about the children of Israel yeah they are and they have questions hard questions how are they going to overcome the Promised Land how are they gonna they are untrained men and not soldiers nothing and they're going into battles with Kings and and all kinds of armies and great armies and histories that were known and all of that how are they going to get out of Egypt it's not for you to know how you're going to get there you just believe what God had said God is responsible to get you there all right now you you think about not scientifically proven the the very first fact that God came to Moses a light at a bush a burning bush and fire that it was a contradiction in itself it didn't start with any understanding of a man how can a bush that's not a waiter that's not that's not dried or anything God takes it and lights it up and fire and it's not consumed hey explain that to me scientifically there was no way now because Moses believed in the god of the impossible because Moses did they believed the god of the impossible math and impossible understanding he was able to stand there and he kept walking yeah they all stuck between the the army of pharaoh and the right sea and God looks at them and says I didn't tell you to stop I told you to keep walking was that in which direction and said oh keep walking towards the sea now there were they had better odds if they were to fight the army of Egypt then they were with the Red Sea my brother my sister let's not take the things of God and try to understand it with our mental ability Let's Take God as in his word let take him for the promise that is given it's up to him to bring the promise if you promise it he's going to bring it to pass I say this morning let's keep walking I don't know what you're going through you keep walking you keep adding one stone you keep adding this you keep adding you keep letting the light shine he will guide you home he will take you home let y'all stand this morning [Applause] the trouble of it is the devil tells you oh you you how can you go so far blindly you have to try to see it somehow let him show you let him reveal it to you no the Revelation that I receive is he's going to take me home the Revelation I receive is I just need to walk in the light that's given me that's why we don't walk by somebody else's revelation we walk by the revelation of the revealing themselves to you which is even the very Holy Ghost Jesus Christ revealing himself to you that's what he wants you to walk in you say father I I see what I see because you you help me see you showed me to and that's what I'm gonna walk in and if he wants you to walk in more he will reveal more don't ever think that for God to show you more you got to go to somebody else so God can show you more no God will show you more when your time to know more is and it will reveal to you in the season that he wants to reveal it to you if you don't understand it put it on the Shelf let the old wise God come to bring in the past let's just bar ahead our gracious father we are so thankful today Lord Lord God if we will say it our desire for the
