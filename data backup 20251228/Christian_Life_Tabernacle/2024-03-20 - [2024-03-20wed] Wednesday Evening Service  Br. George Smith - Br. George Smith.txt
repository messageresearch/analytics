enjoy the goodness of your word help us now bless brother David bless each one we ask in Jesus name amen you may be seated it's good to be back in Texas again today try to get here every 6 months but it's not possible sometimes and um I uh I tried to get away from this but the Lord kept directing me back to the book of Acts amen and I know that everybody hasn't read it the way we instructed 6 months ago but you get another chance and I'm so happy that God is a god of variety that'll be all the music thank you I can't sing like the brother um God is a god of variety I can't preach like Matthew and believe it or not Matthew can't preach like me he can't stand still but we're happy to be here and know that uh things are progressing I've seen the church it's beautiful you all have done a wonderful job and uh God has blessed you so maybe the next time I come we'll be over there but uh tonight we want to look into Acts chapter 13 there's got to be something in here that we are going to unpack you know there's 28 chapters and U I can't be here 28 services in a row but um we're going to unpack a chapter or two and see what God has for someone here tonight if you've come under expectation God will speak to you his word is still correct it's always right and this is our prophet's absolute can't go wrong and in the first 12 chapters we've studied uh the growth of the uh early church some of the difficulties the church at its beginning when it was getting started and now we've been restored back to the original by a prophet and we're going to be restored all the way back to Eden not just to Pentecost all the way back you know so like I told you before God's map is all on one page I'm sure everybody understands that but of course all you young people with the cell phones you're looking at little piece but God's map is all one page and so he sees the entire picture he knows your entire life you don't have to remind him he knows you now Paul being God's voice of the first age then we have God's voice today through our Prophet the same quality of uh inspired word the same Bible doctrines and that's one thing that attracts our attention to this message is that it's scripture you see Paul saw that there was going to be problems he was a prophet he could see a ways down the road and he um he had been preaching in this one area called galatia and so then he came by a few months later after you know he preached there and baptized and he comes back and these people are kind of wandering off the path you know some other people come along hey you see this and that and start figuring things he said people you've been attracted to a zero you've been attracting to nothing this is the gospel here he said if I come back or Silas or Dave McGary or George Smith or William brandham anybody and doesn't preach what I preached it's going down so we have the word of God we have it in our language everybody doesn't have this there's 7,100 languages on the planet today some are many some are few but there's distinct languages the Bible is only in 700 languages so everybody doesn't have the privilege you have so we're we're going to see these people soon these people we talking about here they're waiting for us we hold the key you know and so we're um we're happy to be here now our brothers and sisters back here they came through some very difficult times you think you have problems because you know the baby's not ready and husband didn't get home from work and how are we going to pay the rent all these little things what if you had to live like these people it'd be a little different story but they came through some serious times persecutions encounters with the law some went to jail some died for it but um you know Jerusalem is where it all started I'm telling you things that you already know because when you teach you have to repeat right just like School repeat because he wasn't paying attention the first time apparently but you see Jerusalem is where it all started and there are still till this day annual pill pilgrimages people going to the upper room people going to Calvary they come from all over the world and some of you have been there and we had plans to be there in March and May and so forth but hey they're at War we're not going maybe December but um it was at Antioch which is a city that is now in Turkey uh that became the center of early Christianity and by the time of Acts 13 it could have been a city of over half a million people okay and it was divided into ethnic groups now the Great American way is to let's put them all together and stir it up and see if it works it hasn't worked all that great but back then they had separation and they had walls the Greeks lived over here syrians Africans Jews but the gospel goes beyond the barriers and uh brings people together in Jesus Christ and that's why we have this multi-racial church here the gospel of Christ is for everybody you see and so that brings us to Ephesians 4 where it says there's one body there's only one Heaven see there's not a Methodist heaven and a Baptist heaven and a Thundurus heaven and a black Heaven oh there's one heaven and we're going there if we live by the word so the scripture says one body one Spirit even as you're called in one hope of your calling one Lord One Faith one baptism so why all the division one God and Father of all who is above all and through all and in you all but un every one of us is given the grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ okay back to the book of Acts chapter 13:1 now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers as Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius of sirene and Manan which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch and Saul so they had multi- uh ethnic leadership there was Barnabas he was a hel helenistic or Greek from Cyprus from the island he came from a Priestly family he was the leader of the new group then there was Simeon an African there was Lucius of sirene that's Libya another African and Manan childhood friend maybe even a relative of Herod that was the Herod that killed John the Baptist and he was probably a a privileged member of society and then there was Saul he was a Greek from Tarsus with religious training and Roman citizenship these were the teachers and the prophets in the church and so when you read through the book of Acts you'll see that this was the model Church in Antioch and they were blessed of the spirit verse two as they ministered to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where to I have called them so God always knows what he's doing and see you see this finish church over here that didn't just go up overnight there was a lot of you know massaging and trial and error you know God is eternal his maps on one page page he's not guessing how it's going to be done you know he doesn't say well let's let's think this over let's see if this works let's try this see if it works oh that's not the way God works he knows exactly what works and he doesn't ask you know what do you all think about it either so he knew all all along God knew all along who Saul was that was not a mystery he saw I make make all these mistakes you know God knows what he's doing you see and he knew how how he would use him and he knows each of you now he's going to use you all you got to do is be be uh uh available yes Lord whatever you say no thinking no you know if this will please grandma if this no whatever God wants you see and God knew who you were and how he would use you way back when God was the last thing on your mind you see you can run some of you tried it but you can't hide he will get he will find you Saul was running now he had he had a uh it seem like he had a a real good reason he was uh with the traditions of the fathers and Moses said Moses said but see God doesn't stand still God's word moves just like the sun moves and so uh God called him so let's you know focus on this interesting figure uh our Prophet thought he was very important and so he was born in Tarsus but he was raised in Jerusalem this is Saul his father was a Pharisee that's the elite of Judaism they're at the top the pile the Pharisees and he was a Roman citizen and so um that came in handy but by trade he was a Tent Maker yeah they made tents like today we could say they would be uh just cheap RVs you know something similar and um he was trained by Rabbi gel one of the best and the training of to be a rabbi to be you know U what do you call it a u Pharisee usually began about 14 and went all the way to 40 years old Long training you know and so he became the Jewish council's chief agent of anti-christian activity and they still have that office over there today called anti-missionary activity even our friends from Salt Lake City are there because everybody wants a corner of Jerusalem everybody wants I got an address over here and over here everybody wants to you know they they've said to me many times why don't you buy that building then you can have William brandham Center no thank you we're not interested in bricks you know here and so the uh even the Mormons had to sign papers we will not go house to house okay but they have a nice address over there and um so he was very zealous in keeping the traditions of the fathers you know Moses said and every Sabbath which is satury right here in Dallas right all around the world in the synagogues of the Jews they still read the book of Moses their Prophet the light hasn't come on for him yet but it's coming okay so he was called by his Jewish name Saul probably in memory of Israel's first king and he was a member of The Tribe of Benjamin but after his conversion he started to be called Paul that's right here we'll read that a few verses here that could have been his Roman name you know and even though he was a troublemaker in the beginning God placed him in a position to be a Apostle to the Gentiles that's us he was the Apostle to bring the word this way and um now Luke he's the actual writer of the book but he's only a disciple see you're many of you are disciples you're followers of the word but Luke he was a he was a disciple he wasn't an apostle uh disciple is a follower while Jesus was on Earth he had 12 disciples we all know that and Jesus knew who Judas was from the before he ever called him he had to be part of the picture now I'm sure there's some of you like to put puzzles together I don't have that kind of patience but you know there's only one piece that'll fit right there I might not like that color but that's the only thing that's going to fit there so Judas had to be part of the picture in brother Brandon's Ministry there were people that I wish would have got lost but they were there they were there making his life miserable and he said I'm glad they showed up because if they hadn't showed up I might be in the wrong calling here might be something wrong with me so it was just part of it so Judas had to be there okay so an apostle is one that's sent out a missionary that's in Acts 1:8 so these 11 disciples they became Apostles Thomas was the first Apostle immediately after he saw the the the nail Prince he took off to India he was the first one that took off and he established the gospel of there he died over there and so uh Paul was a missionary an apostle and he was the first church age messenger we're going to get into the rest of it here just pay attention and so Paul you know this person had to have a special anointing to be the bridge to the Gentiles because Jesus told the disciples you're going to be my disciples my Witnesses only to the house of Israel the gospel the whole thing came to Israel and then eventually when to the Gentiles you see but somebody had to be the special person that being Jewish yet could deal with the Gentiles so as this Apostle and being such a stickler for the truth he became much more of a problem for the unbelieving Jews than he ever was for the Christian Believers not in violence but in ideology just in in the thought in the way of of saying things and he was always under threat of his life from his former colleagues the people he was you know fighting with people he was with before that they wanted to kill him so in a nutshell Paul became Christianity's leading evangelist and theologian now we're going to explain that just a minute don't don't tune me out when our Prophet says Theologian because those guys are projecting their Doctrine from their denomination a good Theologian is one who can very capably defend his faith by the scriptures amen not because somebody said so and we've got people today that are brandom theologians mhm I know them brother brand said yeah but you're not living it what about all these other things he said just saying so as his status in the church was Rising his perspective of himself diminished at first Paul considered himself an important Christian leader then later in 1 Corinthians 15 I am the least of the Apostles and not worthy to be called an apostle because I persecuted the Church of God all those people he you know murdered sent to prison whatever he had to live with that the rest of his life God didn't take that out of his mind he had to live with that stuff you know and um so he willingly told about his mistakes and his failures he didn't gloss it over um he didn't pretend uh he didn't always have a happy face he was very Stern sometimes and so he was very human but he was totally God inspired and directed and anointed by God just like William brandham brother brandom says over here in faith 1956 we don't care to be a big number of people I never want to be big I want to be honest I never want to be great I just want to be sincere I want to love the Lord I want to serve the Lord I want to help the people so finishing this verse up here in 1 Corinthians but by the grace of God I am what I am now your pastor can only be David McGary he cannot be anybody else I can't be anybody else you got to be you so we we know what he's talking about so without God's Amazing Grace we would be totally lost without hope you know out of here so that's how Paul started out you I'm yeah God's done something for me I'm out here preaching later he said he was capable of nothing good see he keeps going down down that's in Romans 7 then in Ephesians 3 less than the least of all the saints oh he's getting down low and finally in first Timothy chief of Sinners he didn't keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger no he kept getting smaller so the Fearsome Pharisee of the Pharisees became the Fearless Apostle to the Gentiles his motto was to live as Christ to die as gain that should be our our uh word also so brother Rand says make yourself yourself little and God will bring you up he that exalts him exalts himself shall be a based but he that humbles himself shall be exalted I like that he says always keep humble be little be small in your own sight no matter what God does for you just see how much more humbler you can be all the time the more God blesses you just keep getting more humble all the time and he can continue to bless now that might sound like a paradox but that's what we care the level you got to keep things balanced you can't eat chicken every day oh you got to stay balanced and we have to balance oursel with the five Ministries in the scripture now you know what's going to happen if I see you going to sleep okay so when you consider Paul's testimony in Galatians one this transformation didn't take place overnight okay it took about 10 years for him to get it all straightened out yeah and so the lesson is let's be patient with those that are coming along we've got new people here we got people that never heard of Paul never heard of William Brown never heard of Malachi all these things that we take for granted be patient with them be patient with the kids they're coming along slowly you know and U so we know that God loves us we know that he's with us and we want to be patient he he knows what he's accomplishing and how to accomplish his will you see that remember it's by his grace that we Are Witnesses see if there's a wreck out there and police come we didn't see anything we heard it but we're not Witnesses if you're standing out there you can be a witness so Witnesses being um having a uh a personal transformation you know what you're talking about so we're not lawyers to argue the case Jesus Christ is our Advocate we're not judges because nobody qualifies no matter what your name is so in verse three they fasted and prayed says here and prayed and laid their hands on them and sent them away okay we're making progress um Paul was a missionary for 30 years and in that time he traveled about 10,000 miles he didn't have what we got outside but he walked maybe a rote a horse who knows but um so away goes Barnabas and Saul and their young help John Mark they sailed from the port of salua which is you know there in Turkey over to the island of Cyprus and after preaching all the way across the island they came to the other side to the city called Pathos and they encountered a challenge now this is the westernmost City on the island of of Cyprus and there was a an intelligent there man there kind of like a governor his name was sergis paulus and he was hungry for the gospel so when the gospel came by he made time I want you guys to come over we're going to talk about this so he ARR arranged to hear the preachers but there was also a magician a man that worked with magic worked with Crystal and he was from the Dark Side okay he was a sorcerer he was a false prophet and he was trying to ruin God's program remember every move of God has twins this beautiful church has twins God lets the twin sit here and prosper looks like he's one of us but he's here for a reason right for the perfecting of the pastor he's not leaving you know and so we these twins they were always there look at verse six for example here let's say and when they had gone through the island of papos they found a certain sorcerer okay they ran into this guy false prophet a Jew whose name was bar Jesus which was with the deputy of the country serg just paulus the deputy u a prudent man who called for Barnabas and Saul and desired to hear the word of God but elas the sorcerer that was his name by interpretation uh withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith now you don't want to hear this these people are crazy but you're okay then Paul whose name was called Paul Saul whose name is called Paul filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes on him uh if a prophet sets his eyes on you're in trouble you see and he said oh full of subtility and all Mischief thou child of the devil thou enemy of righteousness will thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord and now behold the hand of the Lord is upon thee and you're going to be blind not going to be able to see the Sun for a season and immediately there Came Upon him a Mist a darkness and he tried to find somebody to lead him then the deputy when he saw that what was done he believed being astounded at the doctrine of the lord well yeah things got serious really quick you know and it was all in God's plan we don't have to worry just walk softly before the Lord he will provide the answers you see and so all this happened right in front of the Roman ruler he believed so brother Bram says it's a cursed thing to the Church of God for man to put his hand upon the moving of the spirit yeah you go trying to well I think it should be this way you better zip it cuz things could happen to you you know and um so at this point you know um one of the things it's hard to understand you know all the supernatural that was done in the ministry of William brandham right here in Dallas don't worry about the rest of the world this right here all those people all the time he spent here from 58 or so on where are they you know but you see in the 20 and 21st century we're dealing with very intelligent three kinds of believers yeah so over in verse 13 they sailed up to perga at that point John Mark left the party went home we don't know all the reasons not important but he went home later with the encouragement from Barnabas he became a key leader in the early church now look at chapter 13:14 and when they departed from perga they came to Antioch in pidia and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down they didn't go out there and beat the drums hey we're here now we can start but they came in quietly on the day of service at the right time sat down quietly okay now this Antioch is talking about here uh don't get too excited that's another one of 16 cities of that same name but it tells you which one of peria so let's see where we're at here verse 15 uh after the reading of the law and the prophets so see every Sabbath they read the law and the prophets uh the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them saying yeah you men and Brethren see they've never seen these guys before but they recognize little something different about them if you have any word of exhortation for the people say on okay they arrived at the right place the right time they showed humility they showed respect and they were asked to speak so 16- 41 is a great message all inclusive quoting the prophets Discerning warning let's see what it it says in verse 16 for example Paul stood up and beckoning with his hand said men of Israel and you that fear God give audience okay so he proceeds with a brief history and they couldn't deny the history it's all true what what he saying yeah that's exactly right yeah it's all right okay fast forward to verse 23 so talking about David and of this man's seed God according to his promise uh raised unto Israel a savior yeah Jesus when John had first uh preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel and as John fulfilled his course he said whom think ye that I am I'm not he but behold there cometh one after me whose shoes of his feet I'm not worthy to lose I can't tie his Sho strings men and Brethren Children of the sock of Abraham and who serve among you fearth God to you is the word of this salvation sent God did all this for you for Israel see they didn't all just fall in line because there's predestinated numbers now the empty bench doesn't scare me at all I'm only concerned about you that did come take something home you know but we don't need all of Dallas here or Bedford anywhere else we just need God's people you see and so verse 29 and when they had fulfilled all that was written of him so he's he's basically telling them this day all these scriptures are fulfilled you all memorized all this back here it's come to pass and they did that according to what it was fulfilled what was written says here they took him down from the tree from the cross put him in s Seiler but God raised him from the dead and that was the that was the critical point okay so they knew they'd been here and knew a bunch of people got fed and got a bunch of people got healed and they killed him now you guys say he rose again where is he if God is with us where's the Miracles well look around I can see a lot of Miracles David's a miracle Les's a miracle you know I'm a miracle and so um uh the resurrection is the Cornerstone of our entire message brother BR says it's the Cardinal resting place of the Gospel no matter what he did if he did not raise again from the dead then all of it was in vain it proves to me that he was God so I don't have a lot of patience with some friends of mine that are the first thing out of the mouth Jesus wasn't God then what are we doing we might as well go get a big TV and sit home no it doesn't work that way you see he says and I think it's the great coronation of the Full Gospel is the resurrection and its Divine promises so to my opinion the resurrection is the greatest of all the promises of the things of the scripture and Paul says here in 1 Corinthians if in this life only we have hope in Christ we are of all men most miserable we're we're just going around circles you know but there is a resurrection for those who have surrendered their entire life if you've come here because your mother said you got to come well you might want to pay attention but you got to come because it's real to you you see so those who been have uh surrendered their entire life and can say Amen to all the word of God you see anybody can read and repeat they're doing it in all the churches in Dallas today tonight they're reading and repeating but it's got to be something real it's got to have a life to it you see and so um but there's only a few that can take it serious and live it all others will continue to play Church the day after the resurrection that's the only time that we can retire is after the resurrection see and so after the resurrection there'll be people coming in here pretending because there's three kinds of Believers I wish I could say we're all going to heaven it'd be nice I don't know who all who all is going I'm going so let's go together so he continues the same theme verse 31 and he was seen of many days of them which came up with him From Galilee to Jerusalem who are his Witnesses unto this day and we declare unto you glad tidings we got good news for you how that the promise which was made unto the fathers God ha fulfilled the same unto us uh their children in that he hath raised up Jesus again as it is also written second Psalm Thou Art my son this day I have begotten thee so he preaches a very good gospel to them and he could have said enclosing you know like some preachers do um of course what is the point of you saying all this here in Antioch well look at verse 38 it says here be it known unto you therefore men and Brethren that through this man is preached unto you the Forgiveness of sins and that's still the message today that's why this cross is up here that's why we sing these songs right the blood has never lost its power it's by faith we have such a simple message only believe you don't have to figure it you don't have to memorize it only believe so forgiveness of sins to Israel 39 and by him all that believe are Justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses beware therefore lest that come upon you which is spoken of the prophets behold you despisers and wonders and perish for I work a work in your days a work which you shall in no wise believe though a man declared unto you so somebody has to there's people to fulfill each part of this message each part of that puzzle has a place so there's people that are going to deny it there's going to people walk away but there's people going to believe because there is a bride okay verse 42 where we at and when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue so he's he's said all this they they just came in to sit down to to visit you know hey speak to us so when the Jews gone out of the synagogue the Gentiles outside hey we want you to preach those things to us next Saturday okay now when the congregation was broken up many of the Jews and religious prelit followed Paul and Barnabas who speaking to them persuaded them to continue in the grace of God so the the fellowship continued and um and 44 and the next Sabbath came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God but when the Jews okay this is the people that was blessed last Saturday when the Jews saw the multitude they were filled with envy and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul contradicting and blaspheming they were humans they had heard it in their mind sounds good yeah it's good but it wasn't in their heart see and so these fanatical Jews you know they they had a different opinion all of a sudden and there's a saying among the Jewish people if you have two Jews arguing there's at least three opinions yeah so what happened here in verse 46 says here then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold and said it was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you but seeing that you have put it from you and judge yourselves Unworthy of everlasting life we are turning to the Gentiles in other words he he push delete I'm out of here I tried I give you the best we're out of here so um in 47 for so hath the Lord commanded us saying I have set thee to be a light to the Gentiles that thou should us be for salvation unto the ends of the Earth that's us we're at the ends of the Earth over here you know so very carefully very boldly he just spoke the truth and then 48 and when the Gentiles heard this they were glad and glor glorified the word of the Lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believe so if that was the only verse that says that there is a predestination in place there are people that are ordained to believe and a bunch not you see it's right there in your Bible and the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region okay so they all heard about it and um things were happening but you see verse 50 uh but the Jews stirred up The Devout and honorable women who's that we're going to get to that man and the chief men of the city and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas and expelled them out of their Coast out of here but they shook the dust off their feet against them and came to the next city Iconium and the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Ghost so um they they raised these false Witnesses you know and it was dangerous and we got the man that was smoked blind up in the other part but right here it says you know the honorable women so during the first century uh women were in public office just like today okay they ran their own business gaining wealth gaining influence the tragedy was that once they uh gained that political and Social Power they employed that leverage to reject the gospel to protect their interests sounds like America today doesn't it the same Spirit has come all the way through yeah clear back there so with this rejection and persecution what did Paul do did you know 911 please help no he called Jerusalem hey send us reinforcements did he have a pity party did you give up and go home no mov on to the next city Shake the Dust off and go I've done that many times when you just can't have Fellowship people just are against it seem like fine I got other places to go there's only 52 Sundays brother brother David reminded me of that a long time ago he says it doesn't matter what you preach I've got 51 Sundays to straighten it out got to love him okay we got time let's go into ver chapter 14 says here and it came to pass at ionium the next C that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews and spake that a great multitude both of Jews and also the Greeks believed okay so they spoke got Believers and they spoke freely there were converts but the twin is never never too far away verse two but the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and made their minds evil affected against the Brethren so here's the lesson when you come across confusion whatever size it comes in whatever color turn and go the other way you're not going to change people's minds because they're not looking for a solution they're looking for converts to their confusion and God is not the author of confusion you see so just leave it alone you see so they stayed a long time says right here in verse three uh they AB Bo there speaking boldly uh the testimony and so forth and there was wonders done by their hands h now John 14:12 was in effect Jesus said back there okay you're looking at me kind of strange it's back a few P pages to the left here uh John 1412 say says very simply uh verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go to the father and brother brandom you know straightened that out he says wasn't greater but it's just more of them so these these things were happening these weren they weren't just sitting there and if you'll notice throughout the Book of uh acts they weren't out there just repeating what Jesus said it was actually they were actually living it you know and across the page and 15:7 it says here if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done for you be done unto you so it was happening they didn't have a new testament to quote from they were living it it was being written right then so they only had testimonies they had witnesses that was their gospel because they were convinced that this was the son of God he did raise from the dead in accordance to all the scriptures back here in the Old Testament so it was God in real time living out the promise in the first church and the only hands that God has are your hands the only feet he has are your feet yes so yield what you have you see he will use you in ways you can't even imagine but the confusion continued because the troublemakers were anointed from the Dark Side determined to bring division you know the unbelieving Jews also helped the unbelieving Gentiles and they abused the missionaries they stoned them with big rocks and they were totally under control of satanic forces and those forces are now maturing in 20124 very visible I know some of them okay so Paul and Barnabas left town they move over to lisra and Derby preaching the Good News and In This Crowd where they arrived there was a crippled man now I don't know if you've ever seen one of these people but like one brother said it's like spaghetti the guy has no muscle they're just you know limp got to pick them up you know and so here's this crippled man he's never walked he was born with the defect no muscle in his legs or arms but when he heard the word spoken clearly in his language it's right there vers chapter 14 he believed so while preaching Paul discerned that he had Faith to be healed from the gospel he was hearing in his language and he said in a loud voice 14:10 a loud voice stand upright on their feet and and he leaped and walked instant Miracle now if you've ever spent a week in the hospital you got to go through Physical Therapy get the muscles going again you know right well he's never walked never in all these years and all of a sudden he's got muscle he can leap and walk and jump and so he's happy and um you know uh the reaction of the people in verse 11 let's say here and when the people saw what Paul had done he's in a foreign country foreign language interpreter no doubt they lifted up their voices saying in the speech of the lyonia the gods are come down to us in the likeness of men and they called Barnabas Jupiter and Paul mercurious because he was the chief speaker then the priest of Jupiter which was before their City you know he was important person brought oxen and garlands under the gates and would have done sacrifice to the people they were serious they saw this Supernatural never seen nothing like it obviously something Big's happening here let's have a party let's have you know roast this oxen and so forth so they were totally impressed to begin to worship and they gave Pagan names to God's servants and uh it seemed like it was right to them they didn't know nothing about the Bible the pre priest is arranging for you know the oxen and so forth they were very serious you see if a man doesn't have the Holy Ghost on his soul and in tune with the god of the Bible that person will almost feel comfortable with this type of worship you see now you people that come from other countries you know what it's like over there in the Catholic Church it is serious they'll give anything because that's what grandma did and Grandma did you know and so it's simple idolatry and God hates it okay but your Revelation must be in balance with with the word not with brother David's ideas or my ideas or even William bram's ideas got to be in tune with the word over 200 times brother Ram says back to the word let's pay attention Okay so it's got to be in tune with and in balance with God's written word not fanatical paganism so brother R says the real church is a real San gospel San gospel is balanced it's not over here it's not over there it's balanced you see the real church is a real s gospel right in the middle of the road it's not cold and starchy neither is it fanaticism it's real good old warm gospel heartfelt love of God going right down the middle of the road calling from both sides and how you going to get that church right out of the word the year Thum the Bible now Paul wanted wanted to get church right in the middle of the road so he went and studied three years in the scriptures that he knew therefore Paul wrote the bigger part of the New Testament God had him do that because of the coming Gentile age Matthew Mark Luke and John the four gospels they were Jews but Paul wrote most of the letters okay so the reaction of the two missionaries in verse 14 of chapter 14 uh and when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of all this they ripped their clothes and ran out amongst the people saying s why do you do these things we also are man like passion like you and preach unto you that you should turn from these vanities un the Living God which made Heaven and Earth and the Sea and all the things in them who in times past suffered the Nations to walk in their own ways in other words he kind of ignored it but now that's over with you know and so he's he's uh he's upset and with all that he hollered and explained they almost didn't succeed the people were just about to burn The Oxen just about to have the big sacrifice and worship them but you see no true servant of God will accept any kind of worship it's nice to send Brother David birthday card we don't worship the pastor like they do in some countries you all know that to be true right um neither will he allow worship to anyone but the Lord Jesus Christ brother brandom would not even go in privately where only a few people would have seen him and kiss the pope of Rome his ring he had the opportunity believe it or not yeah he says right over here in um 1954 he's talking it's called the India trip report I had an audience with the Pope that was scheduled and could have gone up and talked to him but when I found out you had to kiss his ring and his toe no I'll give any man his due regards as Reverend Dr whatever and take off my hat yeah but when it comes to worship there's only one that's the Lord Jesus Christ and so I will not do that he had the opportunity and for those of you might be wondering that was Pope Paul I mean Pope Pas I 12th who was in from March 39 to October 58 so once again over here in chapter 14 the persecution double-minded Fanatics they have always been a fa part of the fabric of the Gospel we've got the put up with them they're they're just part of the puzzle you know um if they if they did not show up we would have reason to wonder are we in the right way Jesus said Beware when all men speak well of you well we don't have to worry about that do we no back in 1950 brother Bram said Behold the Lamb of God get ready wake up get your conscience back out here in other words quit daydreaming pay attention get your soul out here with God get away from that sense bound existence you can go look that up too on on your magic phone sense bound existence we're we're we're trapped by the senses get away from that sense bound existence lift up your heads redemptions drawing nigh get ready signs and wonders appearing critics infidels waxing worse and worse yeah 1950 not 2000 no 1950 we've got to put up with them but we're not looking to them we're looking to God so the twin must appear okay and we have we must have real opposition um but you must know that you know that you know you got to be solid secure and that's why the repetition that's why we sing the same songs that's why we go to the Lord in prayer to keep solid okay um your experience and your Revelation must be backed up by God's word not by popular opinions doesn't matter what everybody's saying stick with the scripture okay back to our study 14 and 19 and there came certain Jews from Antioch okay they're following them okay who persuaded the people and having stoned Paul so not only this is just few words but there's a whole package here they stoned Paul didn't he have bodyguards where was Barnabas what's going on no they got him out they stoned him and they took him took him out of the city supposing him to be dead got rid of him how be it as the disciples stood around about him he rose up yeah they've been praying for him came into the City and the next day departed unto Derby okay so these troublemakers came from the previous City got the people into a frenzy they stoned Paul and they thought he was dead but there was a great miracle he rose up so they preached the Derby and they returned by the same route confirming the faith of the Believers verse 22 says here um confirming the souls of the disciples and exhorting them to continue in the faith and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God this is not a picnic now just because you're moving into a new church doesn't mean you can just ah relax you know maybe take a little nap no it's still the same God still the same spirit and still the same preaching so uh it's it's going to be through tribulation that we entered into the kingdom okay and um we got here 23 and when they ordained them Elders in every church and had prayed with fasting they commanded them commended them to the Lord on whom they believed and after they had passed through uh pidia they came to pamilia and when they preached the word at perga they went down to atalia and so forth 27 and when they came they had gathered the church together and they rehearsed all that God had done and they uh and there they Abode long time with the disciples so God was with these people he's doing things he's attracting the predestinated seed not everybody believed just a few here and there you know and U do we have time for one more chapter all I want good we got about 20 more here okay 15 we we real quick here verse one of chapter 15 and certain men which came down from Judea taught the Brethren and said except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses you cannot be saved so here comes these people putting burdens on them they can't bear and unless you conform to conform to all the Jewish Customs there's no salvation they want them to come through the Jewish ways and then eventually get to Salvation and so the 20 24 uh translation would be unless you do things exactly our way our understanding in our revelation of God's word you're out of the picture you're going into the hot place there's people preaching that tonight you have to do it my narrow way no but you see Galatians 1:8 like I said before if you're not preaching what Paul preached you're not part of the parade anyway okay brother Brown always directed us to scripture always brought directedness to the open book so circumcision was the argument they had that was a covenant that God made with Abraham back in Genesis 17 so Paul and Barnabas agreed to go up to Jerusalem to meet with the apostles and settle this question okay they stopped at the churches along the way they testified and um brought great joy to the Believers they met with the apostles and told about their Journey but again the Pharisees got involved and demanded here in verse 5 of chapter 15 but there were there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed Saying that it was needful to circumcise them and to command them to keep the law of Moses and the apostles and the elders came together for to consider this matter okay so they had a church meeting and um uh Peter you know told his side of the story verse 7 and when there had been much disputing disputing Peter rose up and said men and Brethren um you know how that a good while ago God made a choice Among Us that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the Lord word of the gospel and believe and God which knoweth the hearts bear the witness giving them the Holy Ghost as he did unto unto us he's talking about the house of Cornus in chapter 10 he says putting no difference between us you know and in verse 12 it says here and then all the multitude kept silence and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring the Miracles uh and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them so they're hearing from Peter they're hearing from Paul and Barnabas and um this is just a private meeting you know with two missionaries told all the things that had happened so the situation we see here is about 48 ad okay and upon hearing the good news about the Gentile Believers over here these Jewish believers they were getting a bit crusty and arrogant well to actually be saved the Gentiles have to come through Jews first in every sense of the word and they must reject uh all their uh ethnic ways and background and accept all the Hebrew religion so there's several angles to this debate and and you can read it carefully for yourself but there's Peter there's the missionaries the third there was James a timely reminder that all these events correlated with the words of prophets so here's the leader of the church okay you guys had the experience but I'm going to tell you what the word says and he's quoting from Amos 9 so in verse 15 it says here and to disagree the words of the prophets as it is written after this I will return and will build again the Tabernacle of David which has fallen down and I will build again the ruins thereof and I will set it up and um continuing 17 that the residue of men might seek after the Lord and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called sayith the Lord who doeth all these things known unto God are all the works from the beginning of the world God can see the whole picture he sees every intent every thought he knows when the first service will be next door we don't know that yet it it'll be soon I saw a part of the family ask him today well you know sin so God knows all these things see and um so he he tells these people you know he concludes in verse 19 wherefore my sentence and my opinion here is that the trouble we trouble these people not which among the Gentiles are turned to God leave them alone they come to god let's do it let's have them but we write unto them that they obstain from pollution from Idols from fornication things strangled and from blood for Moses of old hath um of old time hath in every city them which preach him being read in synagogue every Sabbath there it is 15:21 every Sabbath they read the words of their Prophet just like we do in our church but they feel to see that the Sun moved on you see okay so he concluded that and so this pleased them they wrote a letter to the new converts and um what we have are Paul's letters written to the congregations today we have tape recordings okay so the Brethren took the letter or the epistle that they wrote read it to the Saints in Antioch the people rejoiced you know the word and the spirit and the will of God always agree you can't have the spirit and the word and the will going in different directions they will go parallel they don't cross either they they go parallel all the time okay they work in harmony so you can have a leading you can have a Doctrine and I know there's people watching on the internet thank you Lord for the miracle of the internet uh it has some good good things but you can have a leading you can have a Doctrine even a promise right out of the pages of the Bible but if it's not in the proper season flowing in the economy and the plan of God for the hour you'll be fighting the will of God okay and um you will be fleeing from the presence of the Lord and thinking you're right I mean you know people like that we are right they won't listen to anything and it's not even you know not even in the Bible but um but if you turn your back on the word maybe not openly just by indifference by a bad attitude you ever read about uh uh Zachariah over there in the New Testament John the Baptist father he was a priest he had a Priestly Duty he was doing something there at the altar and the angel appeared and he was already an old man let's say he was 60 whatever been PR praying for years for a baby angel appear and answer to his prayer he was scared just a little bit of fear and because of that couldn't speak for nine months so you don't have to just be ugly you can just be by indifference a bad attitude you'll be fleeing from the presence of God following an antichrist spirit and an antichrist Doctrine and soon you'll be an Anointed with arrogance selfishness self-righteousness respective persons none of which come from God be careful okay so if we deviate one degree off a true Center that's that's why this is important if this if this thing wasn't level I'll come back and check it over there too but see if it's if it's off just just a little bit like that it won't hit the target just just a little bit the marbles are going to roll the other way you so you can be one degree off a true Center and you won't hit the target but you can take a promise right out of context oh it says right here well let's see if it's in context let's see if it's for the time you know and take it right out of this Bible you can believe it seriously give your life for it ready to give your life but if it's not in God's timing and in perfect sequence you'll be out of the will of God you'll be fleeing from the presence of God and thinking you are right thank God for sending us a prophet fulfilling scripture but if you don't know the Bible how you going to know you have to know your word you see verse 36 of 15 we're almost done here um and some days later Paul said un barnas let's go again and visit the brethren in every city where we preach the word of the Lord and see how they're doing and Barnabas determined to take with him John who name was Mark John Mark but Paul thought it not good to take him with them because he departed over there in pamilia and went you know didn't continue with him and the contention was so sharp between these two missionaries that they departed one from another Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus Paul chose Silas and departed being recommended by the Brethren under the grace of God and he went through Syria and cicia confirming the churches so we'll take a look later you know a closer look at this disagreement but um John Mark is a case study in second chances he was apparently spurned by Paul because he'd gone home from to Jerusalem instead of continuing over in Chapter 13 but it was fortunate that Mark's cousin was Barnabas okay he was a mentoring model and he was known as a son of encouragement and uh just as he had done with Paul see the disciples didn't want they didn't want to even look at Paul but Barnabas he brought him in hey he's okay so he's a son of encouragement anyway so thanks to Barnabas John Mark turned out to be a special gift to the church he became a valued associate of Peter and later in life Paul recognized the value of John Mark and he wrote to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:11 take Mark and bring him with thee he is profitable to me in the ministry so men filled with the Holy Ghost and we some of us have Liv long see this men filled with the Holy Ghost sometimes have disagreements yeah it can happen we're individuals we have opinions and sometimes we find it difficult to bend very stiff you know brother R says if you can't disagree with a man and then shake his hand and still have the same feelings towards him then there's something wrong with you if I can't disagree with a man bitterly from one side to the other that means all the way across bitterly disagree um and still think of him as much as Christ would then there's something wrong with my spirit so that's the stature that we're to grow into each one of us be able to disagree and still think of him as much as brother as Christ does so in verse 27 we met the um the some of these Brethren from the early church Judas Silas they accompanied Paul and Barnabas back to Antioch and um then they returned to Jerusalem but anyway it's all part of the big Fabric and I encourage you to read your Bible amen nobody wants to stay away from God you want to get closer to God well when you when you pray you're speaking to God and then you be quiet he speaks to you when you read your Bible anywhere in this Bible that you pick up and read God is speaking to you God bless [Applause] you amen not only did you get a lesson from the Bible you got a lesson in how to read your Bible you know if the Bible raises questions you study to show your self approved you know let it Let Let it speak to you and and let it let it talk to you and I you know as he was reading that uh you know a a a scripture really stood out to me and it was in the 13th chapter as we're reading in the 27th verse and and so this struck out to me because as brother George was going through the scripture there were people that heard the scriptures every day and it never meant anything to them and this is what it says and he's he's talking about and he's talking about he was talking about how now that the elders had rejected the gospel and rejected Jesus and listen to what he says here he says for they that dwelleth at Jerusalem and their uh and their rulers because they knew him not now listen nor yet the voice of the prophets which which are read every Sabbath day look they read them every Sabbath day and they never knew them they never studied they never looked at his life they never took him back to the word of God and took it back to the scriptures you know and and we're we are given in instruction when you see something study it by the word give it the word test how many did here our prophecy give it the word test give it the word test see if he's fulfilling the scriptures see if he was fulfilling the things that were spoken and and then I I just that just struck me he said which were read every day and they have fulfilled them in condemning him exactly what the word of God said they would do so I just think it's uh marvelous I I like going through the Bible like this and and studying it and uh I picked up on a lot of little things that um you know we always heard that scripture that Paul turned to the Gentiles well it was the Gentiles that were right there asking him to come preach to them he said okay I'm done I'm going to go to somebody that wants to receive it so let's come in so I we don't know uh how we're ever going to get through the book of Acts if George only comes twice a year so we might have to have them uh come a little more often and so we can get done with this book and uh go on so um you know so I mean that my goodness when we get over here we're going to it's going to be the Rapture might come before tonight amen so do you love the Lord amen keep us in prayer uh I there's just a lot of good things there I really enjoyed it I think it was placed to us good enough that we could each hear for ourselves and apply the word to ourselves so let's pray uh keep in mind that we've asked our inspector to return uh this Friday to uh give our building one more look over and I I think brother Rogers made it bug proof he's went around and filled every little hole and every little uh uh crack and everything so we hope he's happy and we've done everything that he's asked us to do so uh maybe just the spirit of the Lord would come on them H and uh he'd be gracious and merciful to us but you notice here how all these guys eyes kept falling around causing trouble causing trouble you know brother Bram said when he was they were trying to re model the Tabernacle he'd go down to the city and give him something else and go down to the city something else so that's been our lot but I think that we're ready to overcome amen how many believe we can overcome amen so just pray and if if we can get through this red tape then we have our handicap inspection coming so if we can get through that and everything worked good we were going to try to have our first service Easter but so many people were going to Camp that if possible by the grace of God we'll try to have our first service the first Sunday after Easter if everything goes well if it doesn't go well we'll just keep moving it up and until we do it uh and then we we're going to want to have service for um a few Sundays in a row to get all the U things that we don't know yet they will all rise to the surface uh there's probably problems everywhere just sitting there to come to the surface and um so uh we'll uh do that in and then after we have a few services and we feel everything's good the deacons feel they have you uh under control uh doing what they ask you to do then we will go ahead and uh set a date for our dedication service and we'll have a dedication so is everybody on board with that amen so are youall going to go home and study the book of Acts and and uh and go into it's a great book it really is it this tells you how that they lived by faith and didn't the thing that Malachi for did was to restore back the faith of these men so if you're going to see the faith of the men read the book that describes their faith and how they endured and how they pursued and how they kept going forward and how when they got knocked down they got back up how they loved their enemy how how they spread this word to anybody that would hear it and bringing the good news of the Gospel all of us should be doing that if we have their same Faith you believe that amen God bless you tonight let's stand together oh okay uh what George Don't We Tell so yesterday we went over to see Enrique he's the brother-in-law translator right yes okay adri yeah this boy was in a bad accident Sunday night he apparently was going too fast and he wrapped his car around a telephone pole you can barely see what kind of car it was the whole left side whole right side is matched up his eyes so that was hurt anyway we went to see him and as soon as we came in he started crying oh somebody actually loves me and we were able to pray with him and so he's he's got his wakeup call we expect him in here anytime soon to give his heart to the Lord so remember Enrique amen amen yeah he really was he just uh when me uh brother George and I uh came up to his bedside he just reached out his hand he said I'm so glad to see you he just started balling and everything and and then he said I'm so grateful in my heart that God let me stay here with my family he knows he was this far away and you talk about attitude you know when something when you come this close to the death your attitude towards life changes so you know it's and you know let me tell you one thing that I've the scriptures have done for me as I read them it's always been an attitude changer for me it's always been to redirect the path that I'm on and that's what the word of God's given for it's given for correction it's not given to condemn or punish it's given to alter your way and your direction so it's it's always been great so uh you know we also in seeing him in the hospital um at Baylor we went down to the they call it the truet building probably one of the first buildings that they had there and they built building after building around it but they have hands of all the great Physicians and uh cast to their hands great actors scientist all the Astros Nots all of them are a great big row then you come down the rad and then they get to Billy Graham and they have his hands in his own compartment almost like it was a reverence and a sacredness they know did you know they had one of the hands of the three Messengers that came to this age and they have his hands in a little special place there amen I just thought you know it's funny men testify to God whether they want to or not just like we read that scripture he said they read the scriptures every day and they fulfilled them by condemning him amen I don't want to be on that side of fulfilling the scriptures do you amen I want to be on the right side not the dark side but the right side so if you have somebody on your heart as we bow our heads that you'd like the Lord to do something for or maybe you'd like to have the courage to share this gospel with somebody [Music] and and maybe you have a complex or some doubt and you just like to be free for from it then you could be a greater light and have an experience because as we read that scripture they knew him not they didn't know him but don't you want to know him deeper and and greater in a way that that you know that you've got something to share without any doubt that you've got something to share God did something for you and if there's nothing else you can share share what God's done for you Share how your candle got lit share with a great God that you know that he is people are hungering for something genuine they're hungering for something that's real somebody that knows what they're talking about and maybe you in your heart you'd like just to have that closer relation with relationship with him that when you tell somebody you know in your heart you know what you're talking about believe me they will know you know what you're talking about and the Lord will bless us so if you have a desire in your heart if you'd bring it before the Lord right now and we'll ask the Lord to bless it our graciously Heavenly Father our hearts are open before you father our hands are raised for the needs that we have and our desire is to come close closer to you for you are this word father this is the record of you and and your spirit
