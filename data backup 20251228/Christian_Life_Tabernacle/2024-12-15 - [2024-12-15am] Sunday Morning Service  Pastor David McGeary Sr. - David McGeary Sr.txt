good to have him back in his family I know they traveled to Nigeria uh for the funeral so it's certainly glad that they're back amen God bless you Church um please uh if you can spare me just five minutes to give this testimony uh like you were saying I I went for my father-in-law's funeral um it's been a long time since I've been back there almost 13 years um and um when that happened you know this year has been a good year I don't want to say any other thing than that I have to be optimistic about it um and so when it happened and we had to go for the funeral uh a whole lot of things started happening you know people will talk dreams prophecies um I think my African Brothers will will brothers and sisters will know how it is back home it's no different in America but you know there's some other things that you have to be careful about and so a whole lot of things started coming in friends would say please do this please don't do that please don't do this and so it started creating fear in my mind and I'm going with every body I mean my mom my my my my kids my wife um so that put a lot of stress and burden on me um daily I we hear people even people back home would call me and say I had this dream and that that that I was like okay there's a problem uh and and so in my mind I just sat down and said okay what do I need to do I just went to God and talk to God about it and there's only one thing I asked him I said oh Lord I want to go with every single one of my family and I want to come back with every single one of my family the same way that I took them there I want to bring them back the same way and that's the thing that I asked them yeah I slept I had a dream I'll grant you your wish I was like okay it looks so when everybody keep kept on talking after that I just didn't listen my goal was I was going to take them there and bring them back well the day arrived that I was supposed to go two almost 2 three hours I got to the airport before my flight well they looked at my flight itinerary and whatnot and said oh you came in late you cannot travel I was like this is weird they had to delay me for two days they sent me back home with a whole lot of loads and whatnot they was like go back home I went back home I stayed home for two days when I got back home they called me I have uh I call them my sons they're my brother-in-law but here they're my they're my sons um and when I got home they called me American Airline called me and said well I'm sorry one of your son is not going to be able to travel I was like why and they said his passport expired uh but what I understood was even if his passport expired it could still travel because Nigeria will accept an expired passport but the thing is when you get back home you have to renew it before you leave the country I try to explain my way through it but they wouldn't accept me um my wife was like okay he's not going to go he's he's going to be the only one that will stay at home out of eight of us so one person I was like now could that couldn't sit well with me I went back to what I asked God I said I said I was going to go with everybody and I was going to come back with everybody and that same day I just kept on calling I wouldn't sleep I just kept on calling every single Airline every one of them kept on telling me the same thing no he cannot travel and at some point in time I just sat down prayed again called the same airline that I've called previously and I said well he's got to travel he's a Nigerian he just got to go and they were like yes I was like no you kidding me I just called you not too long ago you said no you cannot go now you're telling me now yes he can go I like yes he can go he just has to go this way this way that way I was like okay I'll take that I was able to book that and he was able to get to Nigeria with me and coming back as well there's a whole lot of stress but it all happened um and here I just want to give thanks that even back in Nigeria my kids were fine everything was fine no one got sick uh and I'm here to just not for anything but just to give thanks to God to say if we ask him um I know the devil tried to put a whole lot of things to me and say Hey you you're not perfect you're not this uh and then something remind me of in my line of walk there's there's a I'm I'm into more process and continuous Improvement and in that continuous and process Improvement you have to acknowledge the current state that you're in you have to know that this is how much I've grown and this is where I need to be and so I was able to recognize that and ask God lord I want to take every single one of them down there and I want to bring them back and I'm so glad that I was able to do that not by my own power but because God granted me that opportunity um and so this morning I'm sving singing marvelous Grace okay all right marvelous grace of our Ling Lord Grace that exceeds our seen and a guilt y unish m outp

Lord has [Music] done for us oh give thanks amen sister Martha has a special amen if she could come at this time God bless you um I was GNA I had originally planned to come up here and share a little testimony before I sang um and then I got a little bit discouraged but then when brother Mark David came up here and he gave his testimony it gave me some encouragement so I'm going to share um earlier at work this week um I had a client I I'm a caregiver so um I went to a client's home and um when I arrived I found him in bed his wife had told me he hadn't eaten all day um he was very weak his vitals were out of whack when I took them and um quite frankly I thought he was going to die that day um he also thought he was going to die and so you know I'm sitting in there with him I'm taking my vitals writing notes down and he starts telling me um the hospice group that he belongs to which family members to call and stuff um in the event that he does pass away and uh um I looked at him and I was like um Mr Fernandez you're not going to die today and he just kind of looked at me um in confusion a little bit he was real out of breath his oxygen levels were really low so he and he lost a lot of color he looked like um a dying man and I thought to myself I could pray for him and um God could heal him um but then the devil starts talking and he's like um you haven't lived the best life and you know just discouraging and stuff but then um I remembered I was listening to the church and its condition and um I'm going to read the first few paragraphs paragraph 11 12 and 13 um and brother random says and remember the word is God God is no more than his word and we're no more than our word and if we make course now you and I in a different stance since we both can we can say oh I'll do a certain thing we mean that in our heart but circumstances can arise that we can't we can't do that what we said we would do but God can't do do that because he's infinite and he knows everything and everything that ever was will be or so he can't make a statement L he knows he can back it up and Abraham when he was 100 years old he called those things which are not as though they were now I'm saying this as encouragement to those that's going to be prayed for the sick Abraham called the things that were not as though they were counting that he who made the promise was was able to perform or keep that which he had promised now when God told Abraham when he was 675 and Sarah was 65 that they were going to have a baby why it was altogether impossible and he believed that and looked for the baby and counted the baby as good as being there for 25 years before the baby ever came and Abraham was 100 when the baby was born and Sarah was 90 because he believed him and he called the things which are not as though they were now that to the sick and Afflicted to be prayed for no matter what your troubles are whether you're what kind of disease you got how bad off you are when you accept Christ his word then you call the things which are as though they were not if they're contrary to God's word now God said prayer of faith shall save the sick well if God said that that settles it it then let's put our mind's hopes and act as though it's already done that's just already finished when we accept it so I remembered that quote and um I prayed for him and um a couple hours later he was up and he was moving and he was eating and I didn't see him a couple of days after but um when I went back on Friday I found him in good condition walking around joking around with his family and so I wanted to thank God for [Applause] [Music] that sometimes I Fall to my knees and [Music] pray come come Jesus [Music] come let today be the day sometimes I feel like I'm going to break but I'm holding on to a hope that won't fade come Jesus come we waiting so long for the day you return to heal every hurt and ride every wrong we need you right now [Music] come and turn this around deep down I know this world isn't home come Jesus come there'll be no war and there'll be no chain [Music] when Jesus comes let today be the day he'll come for the we and the strong just the

inside the Revelation oh and strength anding to keep me in his grave oh something keeps holding me every day I see and helping me Faithfully to overcome my trial oh guiding me [Music] constantly me Glory [Music] reality let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father we certainly trust this morning that something is holding us that we're in the palm of your hand and nothing can pluck us from it father that you promis that if you started the work in us that you would finish it though we get discouraged and we look at our lives and and we feel that we might be a failure and that it doesn't seem like we're going anywhere but yet father you have it all planned out for and you said you wouldn't lose a one and you have a time and a purpose for everything and father we just ask this morning that we can trust in that that our hearts would be lifted up that we could find ourselves in your word and find your word in us we ask you to bless each need this morning each person each problem father there's nothing impossible for our God we ask you to bless us now this morning in jesus' precious and wonderful name we pray pray amen amen as you're turning in your Bibles to the Romans the 8th chapter uh I'd just like to make a just a couple of announcements uh uh so we're we're trying to uh keep the a fore U as free as possible uh uh for of Safety and Security reasons so after service if you'd like to visit and fellow Fellowship uh just go down the hall out of the forer into the fellowship hall and you can visit in there and uh so just feel free to move your fellowship into the fellowship hall I think that's why we call it the fellowship hall it's not the fellowship for year it's the fellowship hall so please go there and and fellowship there and also we we would uh ask you that you don't sit in the four here during service so uh I know that children nowadays are restless and uh and that's because of the technology today kids are have grown up looking at a tablet or a phone or uh you know you see parents take their kids out to eat and their kids are and they don't they have electronic babysitters but uh we don't uh we don't uh believe in electronic babysitters we believe that uh spare the rod and lose the child so you got to train your children to sit in church and uh so uh don't sit in the for year and so if your you have to take your child out uh give it what it wants and then give it what it needs and then bring them back into church okay so we want to do that and also uh we have Construction in the uh back here in the back we're still working I you can see the forers coming together back there and the uh uh uh Pavilion so uh just be careful there's construction material and all that so uh we just try to be careful there so let's turn in Romans and uh just have a little bible uh time this morning in the scriptures and uh we're going to read several scriptures in the Book of Romans so uh we're just going to uh read one and then sit down and just have a little bible uh fellowship and go through the scripture and then share our thought with you this morning amen uh let's read Romans 8 And1 I'm sure we all all love that it's good to have the fry hose with us this morning uh congratulating Lucy now she can look after me and take care of me check my blood pressure and make sure I'm doing good he says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body ye shall live for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry ABA father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then join heirs Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him we shall also be glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which we shall be revealed in us our heavenly father we ask you to bless the scriptures to us this morning in Jesus precious name we pray amen God bless you may be seated I I love these uh scriptures in Romans and we'll just uh uh take a moment and just read down uh together again uh some more scripture as we were reading and so it it says here he says for the earnest expectation of creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God now that just think of that great thing that that you know sometimes we think we're all alone or we're not part of something but whole creation is is has its place and Paul will go on to explain how even creation itself is in bondage and and it's waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and every time it talks about sons of God sisters don't think that just means the brothers and you can get away with murder you know it it means all of us that we're all the Sons and Daughters of God we're all God's Offspring and so uh uh it and being that creation knows that and it's waiting for this manifestation of the sons of God for for them to be made known and and it there's a difference between being made known and being manifested and we're just going to try to share a small thought with you this morning uh I don't know if this is too close I I I'm getting a lot of ring and it says uh it says for the creatures was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who have subjected the same in Hope because the creature it itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious Liberty of the children of God now you notice the these these things are tying together how it's he's talking about the children of God that we might know uh that we're the children of God would just think of the peace that that brings and what it is that God's Desiring uh for us and and we we we find out that we're born in sin shap in iniquity we come into the world speaking lies the flesh Wars against the spirit the spirit against the flesh you you you have full knowledge of all the things that you've done wrong all the things you think all the things you say and and so when you do an analysis of yourself you come up with one conclusion sinner you know what I mean and uh but yet he he stands back and he says well well you were yet a sinner I died for you I purchased you so your righteousness wasn't part of the picture so we want to kind of redraw uh redraw our approach this morning of how that we want to go forward how we want to go forward in our lives how we want to live our lives of what it is in our hearts that we want to accomplish and the fellowship that God wants to bring us into with him because one of the reasons that we were created in the first place that God might have Fellowship he wanted to share himself he wanted to have Fellowship he wanted to have preeminence he wanted to reveal himself and he wanted to take take us back to where we were in the beginning so you know he he didn't just uh uh uh excuse me he didn't just uh put us down here like little mice in a maze and say figure it out and uh if you get through the Maze and everything good for you and if you don't uh you'll perish that was never his intention in the first place but his intention was to have fellowship with you and and because of of when when Adam and Eve fell the whole world came subject to their sin they went through the cycle of life and death they they when winter came they went through the cycle they died their fruit was taken and so they're they're into a bondage and and I can't sit here and say that whether I know that uh whether plants have feelings or or or this and I know people talk to plants and they grow you know what I mean and and and other people they do everything and the plant dies you know I'm not trying to say I got know anything about a psychic connection or anything like that but the scripture says that when we came fell and came into the bondage they did also you you know what I mean so they left they left the condition that they were in the same as we did so you know with God it's all tied together because it's all within the framework of the father he is he's the Creator and maker of all things and everything fith and jointhe it and it's it's it's all perfect you know what I'm saying and and uh I'm sure that uh the father is longing for the day that he can restore everything back to the way that it is that he will cleanse all the sin off of this Earth and and tear down all the scars that man has put on it and bring it back to its uh natural beauty again so there's a great anticipation not only in uh our hearts and our lives but in creation itself and and I wish I could explain that I wish I could tap into that more you you know and I know there's religions that try to tap into the energy of the world and and they have these little pyramids you go sit in and and and if you cross your legs just right and put your hands up just right you get get some kind of uh energy you know what I mean I'm glad I don't have to rely on that I'm glad I have the spirit of God to give us energy you know what I mean so that they they know that there's something out there that holds it all together they they they understand there's uh Body Energy there's whole uh religions and medical Sciences where they take needles and they stick them all over your body you know what I mean and I always thought they stuck those needles cuz if you get stuck by enough needles what hurt you before doesn't hurt you anymore you know it it shrinks in your memory but they they they they have a word for it I'm not sure I have the word right I think it's called Kai or something like that they believe that that gets your body's energy flowing and through you and and there's people that believe that if you put your body in a certain forms you know and they they contort and they they call it yoga or or or or some they do some dances you know what I mean and and and and you know and they think wow you know now they're in Harmony and in peace and so what I'm just trying to point out there couldn't be such an effort towards something if there wasn't something in there that they they're trying to unlock but just think by the grace of God those who walk after the spirit and not after the flesh the they found the secret do you understand to really what that they're looking for they're searching what they're searching through is through a carnal mind they're searching for the baptism of the Holy Spirit where God's spirit connects again with man and that's what it says if the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ that was the spirit of God come down veiled in flesh connecting with man and showing man that there's a God that has power over all Heaven and Earth and no wonder Jesus said if you had the faith you could say to this mountain and be moved or this tree be plucked up and planted and so here's all kinds of faiths and all kinds of religions and all kinds of Sciences looking for really what is the basis of all Christianity which is the union of God's spirit and man's Spirit through the blood of Jesus Christ coming together and man coming together again the price of sin being paid for by the blood of the lamb and now God through that blood by his own justification can allow his Spirit to make contact with your spirit and you don't have to do anything amen but believe amen and accept it so so uh we we we there's a reality in the fact that the the scripture goes on if we read that let us just read on it says uh for the earnest expectation of creation waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption un the Glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know the whole creation granth and travaileth in pain together until now you know when you start seeing your part in everything you're not as insignificant as Satan would make make you out to be you are a part of a a a a beautiful plan of God and nobody can take your place nobody can take to take your spot you've got a a spot to play in it you've got a a role that that that is your place that you must participate in to make it all work our our messenger talks about the fine watch and how sometimes it's the smallest spring or the smallest gear or the smallest wheel that that whole clock is depending on and without that part of it it won't keep perfect time and without your part it it it won't keep perfect time and and what the gospel is trying to do is trying to encourage to you to uh if I could use this expression forgive me if it's wrong but to get into the game you know to get into the program to find your position and your place that that the significant part that you play will be played and the scripture encourage us is don't compare yourself with somebody else only fools compare themselves eles one to another so you've got to find that place in your life that you're participating in the Eternal plan of God and that's where we want to move to because uh we we don't want to be an educated church we don't want to be a church that's built on the knowledge uh of things only and just that our doctrines are right and our baptisms are right and and all and these things all right but we want to move on to a [Music] Perfection and so uh if there if the world's groaning and travailing for the manifestation of the sons of God then I think we can place ourselves and understand that that the the scripture even speaking of it wants to manifest the Sons and Daughters of God he wants the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus to be in us and not in the form of religion religion's a covering religion's a veil so what we what we end up doing is we end up taking Church and religion and our teachings and we wrap ourselves in it and and it becomes like a suit and we say well you've got a very fine suit on you got a nice suit a nice tie you know your shirt started you you you really look good and the outside looks good you know what I mean but we we don't want the inside to be rotten and God doesn't work from the outside in he works from the inside out so he he's trying to deal with our hearts he's trying to deal with what's in our spirit uh and he he wants to have fellowship with that and so it's not a covering that we're after we're after that Wellspring of Living Water that spring up within us that that we know that we are the children of God as Paul he as he he he said here for the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God so what does he give you his spirit for he gives us his spirit that it'll bear witness with our spirit what happened the first time you heard the gospel the first time you heard the gospel there was something in you that we call a seed or a part of God that God put in you uh that something in you that you didn't have in your mind but you had in your spirit that when you heard the gospel it it quickened in you it identified in you it it brought you under conviction it it opened your eyes you felt some form of contact from something super natural to your nature but it wasn't your carnal nature or your sinful nature it was contacting it was contacting the part of life that God had in you and all of a sudden you felt oh that convicts me or that's true or you went home and you pondered it out and you studied it and and and it it it made an effect on you and that's because God wants to have that Fellowship to he he's wanting us to come to the place that we have confidence that we're the sons and and Daughters of God and I thought that's why the enemy tried to fear Martha away from giving that testimony because she she prayed and that prayer produced a result and we'll move into that thought look he says that he says and not only they but ourselves not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the Redemption of our body for we are saved by hope but hope that is seen is not hope for what man seeth why does he yet hope for it now isn't really if we just take a moment what are we all waiting for the Rapture right we're all hoping right for the Rapture we're hoping it comes tomorrow we're hoping it comes the next day okay slowly but surely all of us are realizing this world doesn't have anything for us you know and and and you know all the people that all of a sudden they think they're they're they're so excited that oh we got a new president and the world's going to be better no it's not it might go down the tubes a little slower but it's going down the tubes it just it it just changes its mask I I mean it it's it and remember the love of money is the root of all evil and and money is able to buy things money's able to do things and and the corruption behind it is is unspeakable how people change their morals for a dollar they change friendships over money people are jealous over money money's it's it it the love of of money produces more things when you hear someone stand up and say let's make America wealthy again and you say oh boy more money oh boy more sin more root of evil in my life you know less sacrifice less giving you know it it'd be real good if we all ran out of food for about a week and we could learn to fast and pray huh wouldn't it be tell me how much you'd be on your knees if you didn't have a next meal so and what happens is are we going to put our hope in a president are we going to put our hope in our country can you so you maybe you got one political thing and you think a everything's better well there's people of another persuasion that thinks everything's worse I'll tell you I'm I'm glad I'm counting on one thing and that's the prophecy of God's word my hope is built in nothing less than Jesus Christ and his righteousness that's what we're built in that that that's what that's what we're seeking after that's what we want in our lives that's what we want our contact to be that if the that that we our total hope and our our total rest is for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God that that's what our hope is our hope is in the leadership of the spirit of God in our lives don't let life just push you down the road don't don't let circumstances uh unfold and just because they unfold in a certain way uh just because something happens or there's a change in your life that doesn't mean that God's done with you or he won't lead you or he don't have something else for you sometimes we have to go beyond the camp sometime we just can't set up our our get our lives in such a place where we're in such a routine and everything is just is so uh uh uh ordered for us that we we only wait for the uh leadership of the Spirit when we come into some form of desperation and so now we're we're looking for answers and not leadership we're looking for solution and not leadership we're looking for Relief and not leadership but the real children of God the real sons and daughters of God are led by the spirit of God so he give you his spirit I will not leave you comfortless but I'll come again and I'll send you the comforter and he shall lead you and guide you into all truth and righteousness so what we are this morning is we're a body of Believers led by the spirit of God and Our Gospel is if you haven't received the baptism of the Holy Spirit then check and see for the formula have you repented of your sins have you been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of those sins you say well what's the remission of sins the water's not going to wash the sins off you but along with it comes the Revelation that those sins are forgiven by the blood of the Lamb you know you've done the formula you know your sins are forgiven given and you don't have to keep confessing your sins over and over again that's how the Catholic Church makes a fortune go confess your sin confess your sin go in there and confess your sin again and again and again and again oh Father I've sinned these are my sins and you think he says well you know something if you go be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and receive the Holy Ghost there be no desire in you for sin you wouldn't be beating yourself trying to do penants for the the the flesh the scripture just told us if you you bring your flesh under subjection you know your flesh Wars against your spirit you know your natural tendencies and and that's where sin starts it starts in youres FH and every man's drawn away by by the spirit of Lust by it it draws him away and it starts in your mind but you don't want it to go to where it's conceived and then Pro produces the fruit of sin but if you do sin and you confess your sin he's faithful and just to forgive you but you don't want to remain in that cycle you can come above that cycle and you come above that cycle is when you start placing your life into the leadership of the Holy Spirit and you sit down and you pray for that leadership you set yourself aside for that leadership you get into the place where you're looking for that leadership you're looking that your spirit's right you're looking that your attitude right you cleanse Yourself by the washing of the water of the word of God huah and you participate in Christianity Christianity is a way of life if I could say it like this and I I just say this not to be funny or a joke but to to to let it understand when a person files of follows a DI diet that diet becomes the way of life for them I man a man he's on the carnivore diet all he does is eat meat it's all he does meat meat meat meat would you have for breakfast steak what do you have lunch steak what do you have for dinner Mar steak well it's a way of life and there's vegetarian diets and there's there's this type of diet and that type of diet and what is a diet it's something that controls what you're eating because of what you're eating has the effect on on your body well the natural typees the spiritual how about get into a spiritual diet amen a a spiritual lifestyle a spiritual uh a a a spiritual uh pattern as the scripture says lay for yourself a pattern of good work show yourself to be approved study that you might show yourself to be approved so it it's a participation of the believer it's not sitting back and saying we believe that Malachi 45 came that God sent a pillar of fire and and and that's the Fulfillment of these scriptures what that Ministry came for was to restore us back to the life pattern of our fathers to the diet of our fathers to to the revelations of our fathers that's why we pray for Revelation more than anything else pray for Revelation if I to ask the question this morning not being a critic but as your pastor wanting the best things for your life and I said how many of you last week prayed for Revelation well how does God lead he leads by Revelation he leads by revealing himself if we have a man-made pattern of righteousness that's religion and if you get a certain amount of people following a certain pattern with a certain mindset that's a denomination you say well how could he say that this won't denominate because the individual elect Ed bride prays for Revelation they seek for leadership Lord what would you have me to do I better move because I want to get to my sermon and so and let's just read down it says he says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmity look at the Spirit now this is all about the spirit does this the spirit does that the spirit's our answer the spirit's our reason the spirit is what lets us know we're the children of God I hope we can understand how important it is to come in contact with the spirit of God and anybody can come into contact with the spirit of God Jesus said suffer the little children little children when you know something's wrong to do and you feel it that's the spirit of God making contact with you it Pricks your conscience likewise the spirit also help with our infires for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be and he that searches and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God we can't leave Christianity out of the message the the message is Christianity with all the false Doctrine all the humanism taken out of it all the understandings of God that are man-made it's a a purging the pruning of the tree getting rid of the Trinity ideas getting rid of the man-made evidences of the Holy Spirit getting rid of the the the the false doctrines of of eternal hell and and all these things that eventually as you try to grow they Cloud the mind and so the the the best thing to win the battle in the mind is the word of God and the word of God was presented in this day the Mysteries and the seals open totally exposing the son of predition which came in and mixed all kinds of man-made religious ideas into the framework of the scriptures and yet our messenger cried out to the say back to the word back to the scripture back to what it says and we find out that it's important for the church to be led of the spirit of God not a movement not an anointing that falls on a a body of Believers in the form of emotion those things are fine but this individual leadership comes down to you your very personal relationship with him and your search for that leadership your search in your heart for that leadership whether it be by fasting fasting is not a bad thing to do but you do it privately you do it as an individual you don't you don't uh tear your clothes and I'm fasting you know no you you wash your face you you you stay you you know it's a private thing going on because you're thirsting and you're hungering for the things of God you want God to lead you you need an answer from the Lord you want to let him know that you're sincere about the answer it's a relationship it's a fellowship it's a life could I say it this way it's a spiritual diet as part of your diet it's part of what you do you know okay and and so we've never believed in taking fasting out of a believer's life amen we've never believed in taking prayer out of the believer's life getting alone in the closet we've never wanted to substitute study for pray pray or intellect for revelation we understand that God wants to deal with us and so I just want to move real quick now and come to my scripture and we know he says and he that search the hearts knoweth that in the mind of the spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for a good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose now when you read that scripture that's one of the scriptures that's taken out of context almost more than any other scripture all things work together for a good well that's true but tie it in with seeking the will of the Lord being led by the spirit of God the groaning in your heart your position in your place now you understand how all things work together for a good they all work together for a good when you get the leadership of the Lord in your life they're not going to work for a good if they don't G they don't do anything on your have to lead you you got to be led I mean it there's no condemnation here this morning we're studying the scripture we're just going through the scripture we and you know the I could read a lot of quotes and but I don't think that I need to back everything I'm saying up this morning with a a quote we we understand that this is the things our messenger taught now this is what I've been trying to reach for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate amen Now isn't that the thing that always makes us happy when you talk about your name being written on the Lamb's Book of Life okay we like that I like being predestinated that takes a lot of pressure off me if I wasn't predestinated and I was trying to get in I'm My Own righteousness and then I find out my righteousness is as filthy rags I'm in trouble but he gave me his spirit that if I would be led by that spirit that I'd be called the sons of God and that Spirit would lead me to the place where I knew I was a child of God so I I want to settle that in my heart I'm not fighting to be a child of God I am a child of God I am predestinated I was forn how many know you are forn amen you're not a surprise to God your failures aren't a surprise to God for when you were yet a sinner he died for you so that's not a surprise he's he's trying to accomplish something else God doesn't do anything without a purpose so he's trying to accomplish something in you and he can't do that you're flesh will not do that your flesh will not accomplish what God intends for you to accomplish so he gave you his spirit and that by that Spirit you would be able to accomplish what it is that God had for you to accomplish that's why the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh that's why the carnal mind is an enity with God but the spiritual mind is life and we already said that each of us has a purpose and this is what he says this just go on for for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren and then of course we also know he says moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called then he also Justified and whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us amen now with all that as a Foundation just give me a few minutes to share with you what's on my heart he wants to bring us into the image of his son amen so we know in the beginning this is what we understand that that God uh God had within him attributes and characteristics what that he was and he wanted a way to express those attributes and what that he was and to share himself and have Fellowship uh and we're not going to go into the threefold purpose of God but you know those things many of you have read that and so we we see here in the scriptures that the reason that he predestinated man was that he could take that man and conform him into the image of his son is that right that's what he's looking to do yeah then when Jesus was here he he he was letting the church know that he was going to go pay a price in Calvary for them because he was only going to meet a man under the shed blood in other words God only meets a man who has been to the blood and confessed his sins and accepted the pardon for those sins amen cuz God cannot unite himself with doubt and fear we just read that we are not built in fear we're not established that that fear might again reain in our hearts but that we know that we're the children of God so we we've got to we we want to have that place so he wanted to bring us into the image of his son he knew we were Sinners he died for that he paid the price and now he's going to give his Spirit to lead that man as we just talked about by his Spirit the spirit maketh intercession the spirit does this for us the spirit does that for us by the Spirit by the spirit then he comes down he says all that he forew he predestinated to be conformed into the image of his son so God had characteristics he had attributes he had things that he wanted to uh put on display and share and so he began to prophesy he began to sh shadows and types in the Old Testament Moses began to do works that he did Elijah began to do works but finally that perfect Son of God was come and manifested In the Flesh and he paid the price of unbelief he paid it now his sons and his daughters no longer had to pay that price as Matthew preached which we have in prayer because he's in India now with brother Daren and and so we we understood that there came a time when that price was paid and Through the Ages then uh this Jubilee year that whoever was in bondage could go free and that's why we could teach the Sabbath how he's the lord of the Sabbath and and how that we went through we're in the seventh age so the seventh age the church was the final age that could go free from the powers of sin and death and actually come back to the place where they could become the Sons and Daughters of God now God has a purpose so in him he was a Creator and we we saw him manifest creation we saw all the things that God did for the creation the power he gave Adam and Eve to rule over the Earth and and we we understand those things we don't want to go back through serpent seed or any of those things but God also had attributes that man in his Garden of Eden condition couldn't reflect Adam never could get sick Adam never needed Deliverance Adam never needed salvation Adam never needed Grace Adam never needed Mercy he didn't need any of those things so all those attributes of God were unknown he still had them but he had no way to express them now by predestination in the Lamb's Book of Life you sitting here this morning are the direct descendants of Adam you're the children of Abraham amen not the natural children of Abraham but you're the spiritual Seed of Abraham you're the seed of Faith you're the seed of Revelation you're what God had in his mind in the beginning you're the names that were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world wouldn't it be wonderful if you could start looking at our elves this way I like what our messenger said they said well we're all Americans he said no I'm not an American I'm a Christian Living in America I might have come through my father and mother but my place wasn't with the vehicle by which God brought me here my place was with what he had in his mind of me in the beginning so just think this morning don't look at yourself as being from this Walk of Life from That Walk of Life you just came from those walks of life you came from those walks of life to come to the place that you recognize that you're the children of God you're the Royal seed of Abraham you're the descendants of Adam and Eve the children of God you were made that the first Adam was a gave a natural but the second Adam was a quickening spirit so he quickened you to what that you were in the beginning now that's what we are but I want to express to you this morning something about attributes you are the attributes of God how many have ever heard that you're the attributes of God you're the attributes of God why and he wants you to be the image of his son to be conformed into that image The Works that I do you shall do also and I want to remove man's carnal I I can't do it but I trust the spirit will help us the carnal idea of what that means and how that it works it's not a Reimers or a duplication of the works that he did it was the spirit that was in him the attribute that was in him that produced that result so you can't have the result without having the attribute it's a copy it's an impersonation but you have the attribute because you are the attributes now now here's what I want to say about an attribute an attribute is not manifested until there is a recipient I'm a Healer no I'm not a Healer but I just don't take that out of context God's A Healer but until there's somebody that's a recipient of that attribute that attribute is not manifested so I was sick God came and healed me now I was once sick but now I'm well I now am the manifestation of that attribute therefore I am that attribute made flesh because it's not manifested until there's a recipient of it and when the recipient of it now he becomes the possessor of that attribute I was saved God was a savior God was a savior when he was dwelt alone as the great Fountain of Light am but that attribute never could be manifested until there was a recipient of that salvation and you say well how do you know God's a savior I am that attribute manifested I am that attribute manifested we know what the fruits of the spirit are they're in Galatians we know what Peter says the statue of a perfect man all those things lay dormant if we if we would just look at them let's go ahead just take a moment we'll just take a quick moment and we'll just read it really really quick Galatians 5:22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law let's turn over to Peter and this is another Peter says besides this give all Dyan stad your faith virtue do your virtue knowledge to your knowledge Temperance to your Temperance patience to your patience godliness to Godliness brotherly kindness to brotherly kind kindness charity and if these things be in you and ye abound they make you that you should neither be baren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now so we understand now that an attribute all these all the fruits of the spirit love patience meekness Temperance all the statue things of the Statue of a perfect man all the things that they they sit void until there's a recipient you can love but until you have somebody to love or that love is projected to somebody then it it it remains unknown you understand it's not manifested it hasn't formed an image it just sits there healing just sits there until there's somebody that needs healing Deliverance just sits there until there's somebody that needs deliverance and so these attributes they're never they're not manifested or displayed until there's a recipient of that attribute forgiveness you can't forgive until there's something to forgive now here we are the sons and daughters of God is that right the children children of God that's who we are the direct descendants of Abraham whether you've come to the realization of it or not doesn't mean that that's not who you are you're just still in the struggle you're still in the mental battle you still got to read your Bibles and hear and grow until you can come to the place that that question is answered and God is not going to forsake you he'll deal with you he'll work with you he'll he'll speak to you he'll train you he'll do whatever he's got to do to bring you to the place that you conform to the image of his stun and as many as he loves he chastises but what he's bringing us to he's bringing us to the place where there are the image of his son where we we have the fruits of the spirit we have the gift of the spirit we have his spirit and his nature but that spirit in that nature is not manifested until there's a recipient amen until I show Mercy Mercy is not manifested till I show forgiveness forgiveness isn't man ested until I show Grace he never gave us the gifts of the Spirit the fruits of the spirit the attributes of the spirit so we could possess them he gave them to us that we could manifest them because we can't be in the image of his son until the attributes that we have and we possess as his sons and as his daughters have a recipient amen we've got to come to the place where we forget the idea that our Doctrine is saving us what saved us was that all he fornew he predestinated and he predestinated to conform into the image of his son that he that they could say the works that I do you shall do also because you're my sons you possess the same attributes and those attributes will only be manifested when you have a recipient for him in other words you've got to show somebody love you've got to show somebody Mercy you've got to show somebody forgiveness you have got to pray for somebody you have got to to uh show Grace to somebody show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my Works don't just tell me you have the attributes of God Who is the recipient of the attributes that you possess each one of you God has placed in your own world nobody can take your place and you're surrounded by all types of circumstances and people and all kinds of conditions and all kinds of things that are totally irrevelant to your salvation totally irrevelant to the fact that you've already got your place secured in heaven and your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life and nothing can put it on and nothing can take it off that's not the issue the issue is the attributes that you have finding a recipient so you can be the manifested little Messiahs that we are the church the Christ that we are that's what he's looking for he's looking to see what you are finding a recipient and now we're fulfilling the works that I I did shall you do also not a duplication of the miracle the miracle was the result of a displayed attribute did that make you understand the attribute had a recipient the recipient received that attribute and that attribute produces Deliverance It produced Grace It produced Mercy It produced that's says this is what he said listen what he says he and it's so beautiful see if I find it he said to be conformed in the image of his son that he might be the first porn first born among many Brethren among many Brethren it's from Faith to Faith Revelation to Revelation it's from attribute to attribute how does Christ live you say he lives in me if he lives in you and you have the same Spirit he has in you that Spirit quickens your mortal body not just to the Rapture but it quickens it to the attribute that you possess that that attribute that you possess finds a recipient amen amen The Works that I do the love that I showed you if Our Father which art in Heaven forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those that trespass against us everything we've talked about the attributes we've talked about who we are we've talked about our predestination we've talked about it we've we've set it in stone all right you're the little Messiahs you're the bride of Christ you're the Royal Seed of Abraham you're the children of God you're led by the spirit of God now the question is who is the recipient of your attributes no man lith a candle and put it under a Bushell basket a tree that is Barren and unfruitful is hewed down Peter said you do these things you manifest these attributes you have recipient of your kindness you have recipients of your goodness you have recipients of your godliness and if you have recipients you will neither be Barren nor unfruitful we don't want to be an educated intellectual holding the truth of God in unrighteousness we want to have recipients of the attributes that we possess because those attributes were passed down to us from our Father which is in heaven by the spirit of life and the spirit of Truth be not hearers of the word but be doers of the word also don't look for miracles the Miracles follow them that believe but believe who you are act like who you are let the attributes of Love Mercy patience goodness longsuffering Temperance all of those virtues there's a recipient of every single one of them we are the recipients of the virtues of God and the attributes of God we are where God chose to manifest his attributes now he's calling you to manifest the attributes of God to the Dying World don't get mad at the world be Christlike unbelief doesn't stop God you be a Christian whever you are be led of the spirit that the attribute in your life might shine forth not fake but genuine from your heart do unto others as you would have them to do to you love God with your whole mind your whole heart your whole soul and do unto others the greatest Commandments the greatest things let the virtue that was extended to you freely I've given freely give freely I gave you Mercy Grace love freely give church this is what God's looking for he doesn't need you to have any more knowledge of Malachi 4:5 is that God sent a prophet that's settled isn't it settled you wouldn't be here unless you were invited and we hope you can come to a further revelation of that you know the seals are open you know all these doctrines and we will do these things but let us move on to Perfection let us move on to be a living fountain that the same spirit that was in Christ Jesus shines in us and that they'll know you are as disciples because of the manifested attributes because there's a recipient out there for everything that you are without manifestation without a recipient there is no man manifestation the attributes of God are not manifested until there's a recipient look for pray for ask God to leave you to recipients of the goodness that's in your heart cuz I believe it's there you are the bride of Jesus Christ you are the Royal Seed of Abraham you are The Offspring and Joint hirs of Jesus Christ you are heir to every attribute that he had every promise in the book is yours by these exceedingly great and precious promises we're partakers of divine nature let's don't be hearers of the word let's be doers of the word ask God for isap that you might see don't walk away I was in the story the other day and some boys came in and they asked the lady if they had could buy a basketball for $ Five Doll I knew they had no basketball for $5 but there's a basketball for $35 and you know I wanted to buy them that basketball but they escaped before I could buy it for them I thought well buying a basketball I don't care you know how many yeah types of basketballs that have been bought for me in
