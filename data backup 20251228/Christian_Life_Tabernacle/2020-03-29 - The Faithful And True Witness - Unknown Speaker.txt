assembled not only here but in our homes maybe other places streaming by phone the Lord we're so happy you're the creator of heaven and earth and that you dwell all in all you're with your people we just asked father that you would bless us this morning and our endeavor to serve you and to fellowship with the people this morning we ask you to bless us today in this wonderful day that you have given us we ask for your help in your presence this morning in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen god bless you this morning I'd like to read a little statement found in the message called the way of a true prophet before we read our our scriptures and so thank you musicians this morning and and you may be seated if you liked it for a little bit this morning and we can stand you know it's I guess we as we speak last week you know it's it certainly a challenging time and obviously a time that things are different than they were just a few weeks ago or even a month or so ago and there's been a great change on us and I thought of this little statement that I was as I was reading in this message called the way of a true prophet and he says this great man Jeroboam which was a great mental power and he had the nation in prosperity yet in the sin I wonder if we could take couldn't just kind of type that a little bit tonight to our own country and our own nation in sin the way it is yet prosperity we're going to get a tax cut right away I heard of course anybody can read between the lines there election coming up but so forth and all these things that's going on Israel preachers priests and government had left the Word of God behind and a compromise and that's the way the country was in that condition that it was though they had just as many priests let's read that that's why that country was in the condition that they were in because they had left the Word of God they had left the word of promise in and he said he said though they had just as many priests and just as many preachers as they ever had but they had left off the Word of God got away from it and it's always at that time that God sends somebody from somewhere to blast it back into the path again some fearless person that will rise up with the word of the Lord and shake the people back to the Word of God again and we know that's what God's always trying to do but I thought that was amazing that it's always they had as many preachers as they did they had as many things they had a great intellectual power for a leader all those things were in place but yet the country was in the condition they were in because of sin and it just goes to show that no matter what effort man puts forth no matter all the things that he thinks that can make it there's only one thing that keeps God and God's people and that's his word and so we just want to talk about the ways that God tries to blast us back to the Word of God I really don't you think that this should have been a blast to people to get them back to the Word of God just think of it here's the very thing that strikes everybody that ought to make them come back to God how to fill up the church houses how to put people into the house and prayer and they close them if you know what I mean so Dennis it's going to show one thing for sure that a person is going to have to go beyond the group they're going to have to go beyond the church they're going to be have to be anchored in their heart and in the individual with God's Word it's got to just be that way and so we're going to read a couple of scriptures this morning I want to read the main scripture we're going to read and then we'll read several other scriptures once again like to greet everybody that's streaming we we're trying to interpret this morning into Spanish I hope that that's going well so much technology that is available to us if we can just get it all in place to do the right thing so we're really so let's stand this morning and I want to read a scripture and then just fellowship with you a little bit we're going to have some baptisms right after service and so you can stay streaming for the baptisms if you like and but let's turn in our our scripture reading to the revelations the third chapter and the 14th verse and all of us I know for sure I know what revelations 3 and 14 is but I'd like to start with the 13th verse and tie this together normally we stop and restart but I'd like to read these two together it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and to the Angel of the Church of Lady osya write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God father we ask you to ask your blessings on the word in your precious name we pray amen may be seated we certainly understand this morning that we are definitely in the age of Lady ousia all the conditions around us have always pointed towards that we understood it very plainly that this has become an age that is blind miserable poor wretched and hated and doesn't know it you know you this look how that we thought that we were so prepared for everything and and we didn't have need of nothing then this little teeny microbe comes floating in the sky something that nobody can see nobody knows how to handle that everybody becomes totally locked down in fear and then we find out that we didn't think we had need of anything and now we find that we're in need of toilet paper we're in need of paper towels we're in need of masks we're in need of wipes to wipe our hands and hand sanitizer I mean you talk about a rebuke you talk about a just something that since they're in testifies right into the the face of of man in fact it becomes a witness that that's what it does it could just it's a God's always witnessing his word that's what he does and and so he witnessed that that we were in this age because of where where the situation is and then we get another witness that says what we weren't prepared here comes something we're not prepared worldwide pandemic you know it shows that no matter what missiles you have you know why didn't they just take one of those missiles and blast it up in the air and kill this number 19 you know what I mean because we don't fight principalities and powers we don't find things that we can touch his hands there's more behind it you know there ought to be more in our discernment there ought to be more in our understanding there ought to be more that what we're looking at you know so a kind of one of the questions that I have is what are we witnessing what are we witnessing what it is that we're standing back and witnessing really what is the thing we talked last week that we we saw there was a contrast and God uses contrast he uses contrast to show the good he uses the contrast to really show us here's empower nations a billion dollars in the defense that can here we're fighting something that's defenseless look at what our final defense is don't get around nobody sit car we six feet brothers you know don't shake nobody's hand don't go out to eat in restaurants don't you know no social gather social distancing and everything this is what the greatest country in the world this is what this great world civilization that we have is down to defenseless you don't even know what they're fighting and now they're looking for such small things to help them in their survival we got some guy up there in the spaceship I'm sure somewhere floating around the earth you know he probably don't want to come home you know so you just clean when you start to look at the picture can see I believe every believer is called in this lady OC Dan age I counsel thee to buy of me eyesalve that thou may a city amen so I believe their God there's something that God wants us to see he wants us something that he wants us to be witnessing he wants us to spread for us to find something that were aware of that there's got to be some significant to all these he danced it surely points out the weakness of man and so that's what brought me through this great scripture here that says into the angel of the church of Lady ousia write these things saith the a man another word of a man means so be it the one that says the Amen you ever hear the expression that's the a man of the matter that's the one who puts the period on it that's the one who says this is the way it is that's the one when he says Amen there's nothing to be added you can't take it away this is how it is it's the amen amen who's saying this today if they say that the amen so that's it and what is he he's the faithful and true witness the faithful and the true witness now how could he be a faithful and true witness because this is his identification if I could see his expertise you know when you have a witness you call me an expert witness so what is this witnesses this faithful and true witness what is his expertise what gives him the right to be the witness that saith the witness what gives him the right to say that you're blind miserable poor wretched and naked and say you have needed nothing what gives him the right to say I counsel thee to buy of me gold and try to have what right what gives him the right what makes him the witness that can testify to this age and and it says you know what get what is this great thing because he's the beginning of the creation of God before Abraham was I am on the beginning of the creation of God I'm the one who started it I'm the one who spoke it I'm the one that's speaking the faithful and the true witness is the one that speaking so we just want to talk about that faithful and true witness because that's what he is he's a faithful and true witness so let's take our Bibles can read of the promise of this faithful and true witness because if there's ever an age that needs this faithful and true witness it's this time I mean this it just shows us how how feeble man really is and if and I know there's a lot of different people have got different theories on where this came from I had someone that was a doctor that was very connected told me that it was a man-made chemical virus many people believe that but it doesn't matter there's even statements that our prophet has made that would cause us to believe that could be very much true but it still shows us the weakness that man has and it also shows a God that a perv I'd said he's still Jehovah Jireh he's still one that provides so and as we look I just wanted to see that that this faithful and true witness he was promised us it was promised to us and I'm not just speaking today I'm going I'm speaking beyond the promise of Malachi 4:5 beyond the promise of Luke 17 30 beyond the promise of of the scriptures but I want to see that that are we know our messenger was promised we know that the angel was promised but if I did say this this morning that there was something that came along with that promise for every believer and so let us just turn in our Bibles to st. John the fourteenth chapter in the Gospel of st. John and the 14th chapter and I think this is something that we should realize the very importance of this witness this faithful and true witness something that that God has offered us something that God has per by for us he said I'm going to provide for you a faithful and true witness and as we read what this faithful and true witness will do what does faithful and true witness is for how that in the condition that we're in right now how how that we need this faithful and true witness so we read here he says let's start in st. John the 14th 14th chapter in the 12th verse or 11th verse believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake so he said you know believe me by revelation but if you can't believe me by revelation you should believe me by your very eyes and then he says verily verily I sand you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and what soever ye shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son now these are beautiful words to us we're talking about these are words of promise these are words of life these are words that he's given to us in times like these I believe there's that song it was done in times like these we need a Savior in times like these we need our Lord amen it says it if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the Father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you for ever I like this this is not a temporary promise this isn't a one thing this is until you run out go keep promising the church something that will be with him forever amen and that is such a beautiful thing so we can take this promise and we can realize that this promise is good for this time this promise is good for this time and we don't have to go find a new promise because the world found a new book they've been finding bugs all down through the time as brother Micah Park shared with us that fabulous a statement from Martin Luther King in the time of a plague that nearly wiped out the world but let me tell you some this world is not going to be wiped out till this bride is taken out so we can sure and so as we read this he says if you love me keep my Commandments I pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth so what is he he's a faithful and true witness even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive can you imagine the world has what they need but they can't receive it they can't receive it but they can't receive it because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you oh I want just that let that stay with you as we read this and we talked about this this morning you have it he dwelleth in you if you're a believer if you don't have it the very promise to you is that it is that and he shall be in you so he's with you and he shall be in you he said I will not leave you nor forsake you I'll be with you even in you tell the end so we have what we need and if he says and I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you [Music] that's that's eternal word see he's not gonna leave us comfortless in this I know some of you are facing jobs i fellowship with brother last night wonderful time of dinner together and and he said I haven't worked in two weeks I said why didn't you call me knowing anybody said it all aren't plenty of work to do we can mow the yard around here we can stack lumber we can build little things we can do someone don't don't do nothing and he said but you know I was just in the store and I saw a lady in the store and I felt the Holy Spirit move on me and I said ok and he said so I went over and I began to talk with her and we got to talking and she asked me do you need a job he said yeah and he says well he said I'll call my boss and she called the boss and immediately while he was still in the store the boss called him back and got on the phone and they got the interview got everything and he starts this little job Monday I will not leave you comfortless I I will not lead you comfortless comfortless he said I will come to you now that's a promise every time that you're in a situation every time that you're in a problem he said to you if you believe on me and believe in the father and the father dwells within you then know this be a believer be a believer you've got to be a believer our victory is in vain faith is where our power is faith in the word faith in knowing that God keeps his word he says I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you it'd be good to recognize him how he shows up how that ease therapy says I will come to you yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live oh you know we we have so many times we take the scriptures and we look at when they were spoken in history but do be under we remember what his witness is his witness is the beginning of the creation of God that's his witness so these words were not words that were spoken in in 33 AD these were words that were spoken before the foundation of the world they were in the creation of what God created when he had you in his mind these promises were in you to be manifested by you for God was going to use you to manifest these promises and prove his word and so he goes to say here he says because I live I can make this promise because I live I can come unto you because I live I can give you comfort because I live and you shall also live also because I live you shall live also because I'm real you shall have comfort because I'm I'm risen you shall not be comfort less even you can ask what you will and you can have it at that day ye shall know that I am in my father and ye and me and I in you so what a beautiful promise we have and the promise is I will send you a comforter even the Spirit of Truth the faithful and true witness let's just turn to another a beautiful scripture and this read in st. John just the next page over as Jesus is lame this great foundation down to his disciples about the comforter about what he is going to give the church he paid the price he's gone to prepare a place for him but he's going to leave something with the church he said I am NOT gonna leave you comfortless but I'll come again unto you so let us read again found in st. John 15 and 20 remember the word that I said unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord if you have if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if you have kept my sayings they will keep yours also when that beautiful talk about the union of his word that if a person's keeping God's word then they'll keep the words of God also in other words the word that's preached the people will keep that also because there's unity because there's one baptism one spirit one word amen and he said but all these things they will do unto you for my namesake because they know not him that sent me if I had not come and spoke unto them they had they had not had sin but they have no cloak for their sin and I let's listen to that that's a beautiful thing if I had not come and spoke unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloak for their sin if he wouldn't have preached to this country if he wouldn't have given this country the Word of God if he wouldn't have performed signs and wonders and and made the call for them to come back to the gospel he came to this generation and he tried to blast them back so now they have no cloak for their sin you know and I know what it's like I like to see music and it's a beautiful thing and I like to hear worship and I listen to the song and then when you go look at the the people the this the words of the song are wonderful but the people are not lined up to the Word of God yeah and remember we're talking about a faithful and true witness [Music] the words aren't hurt witness beautiful words great singers I remember someone played me a song one time I said whatever you do if you like that song do not go listen or look at the guy who wrote it and sings it well what do you think the first thing they did couldn't take a curiosity yes ate them up so they go there and they get this guy he's got great big old long hair and the ear ring you know what I mean and you know tattoo and everything on them that you know subji zhis and and he's that one of those modern hippy contemporary Christians you know who who just feel that that they've come along and that Christ has come to them in their condition let me tell you something the Lord Jesus comes to people in their condition but he doesn't leave them there amen the gospel is a gospel of transformation it's a gospel that conforms you into the image of Christ and and so we just read this and it becomes beautiful as we begin there but they're without excuse and that's what brought this world in the condition that it's in because of compromise that's the best easiest part for man always wants to take the good things and leave out the rest that's why John said you can't take from or add to the Word of God your name will be taken out of the book of life and the plagues of this book would be visited upon you and so you see that that our nature is that we want to make excuse or we want to provide another way we want to provide we want to do as the love in our heart we want to give every man the benefit of the doubt we want every man to make it into the kingdom we want to start to say well that's not important their hearts right with God they really love the Word of God but remember Jesus will not judge them that heart will not judge them he said I will not judge you but my word will judge you he died for you that's how much love he had that's how much forgiveness he had he laid down his life for that sinner but now that he has preached the word to him they have no cloak for their unbelief he that hateth me hateth my father also if I had not done among them the works which none other man did they would had not had sin if I had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin but now have they both seen and hated both me and my father but this cometh to pass that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their law they hate me without a cause but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the Spirit of Truth which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of me and he also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning so what is this is the spirit and he is going to proceed from the father and he shall testify he's gonna be a faithful and true witness let's just turn to st. John the 16th and the 12th orders as Jesus pens these three and four chapters just speaking about what is coming to take the church what is coming to take the leadership of the church what it is that he's providing for the church to be their comfort what it is that he's giving to the church he's not gonna leave this her church comfortless he is going to come in he's going to lead them and guide them into all truth and righteousness so he is not going to leave us without a witness st. John 16 and 12 I have many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth is come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall glorify me for he shall receive of mine and shall show it unto you all things that the father hath are mine therefore say I that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you a little while and ye shall not see me and again a little while and these shall see me because I go to the Father III think that we can certainly see the Wonder and the beauty of what it means to have the Spirit of Truth to have a faithful and true witness somebody that's not going to testify but is going to testify of the things that he is spoke of his word so just as I finish up here I want us to understand from the standpoint that we are in a very strange time things are changing let me tell you remember when that one guy I guess they tried to get a bomb or something in a shoe or someone hijacked the plane remember that just tried to hijack a plane you realize that that event changed the way that man travelled forever everybody had to take their belts off everybody had to take their coats off everybody had to take these earth travelers had to take their shoes off you had to wait and get one down and go through machines and and then the machines were invading people's privacy so they had to redo the machines and people were complaining because they had to get to the airport two and a half hours early to get on the plane it was absolutely a total wreck because of one event so remember don't forget this event is going to change this world good old Vegas everything's coming back to normal there has been something that has changed but there's one thing that hasn't changed any man there's one thing that hasn't changed is the comforter the faithful and true witness that God has given us so that that's what that what we can we can rest in so I just like to read this he says and one of the great problems for God down through the years as a history of the church goes is to find somebody that he can completely get in his control he only needs one man he always uses one man at a time we studied that a few nights one man not a group he just wants one that that's all he needs because two men would have two different ideas he just takes one man represents himself through that one person never did he do it otherwise than that see now he's got one person today and I know a lot of us automatically are thinking about brother branham as the man okay but it wasn't brother branham the man that brought this message it was a yielded vessel to the Holy Spirit that brought the message the message was the Word of God the message wasn't the messenger the messenger was the source and the voice that the message was delivered so you can't separate the messenger from the message because that's the source of the message it would be like taking zipping my mouth shut and clipping my tongue and then wanting me to speak I know I could learn maybe sign language for those that don't speak or or don't hear but you understand what the point here is the point is understanding who is the Spirit of Truth and he's got that one person today and that person is the one we just read after the Holy Spirit he is the person that God has sent forth the spirit of Jesus Christ into the earth the Spirit of God to manifest and declare Christ through his church see just to continue the life of Christ through the church even so jesus promised this he said I'm gonna send you a comforter I'm gonna send you the spirit of the truth I will not leave you I will come again I will be with you even in you so this person that's going to lead us and guide us this faithful and true witness has been promised to us and it's our comfort that way it's so important that we understand that we know of his existence we have an understanding of that he was a gift of God that God promised his spirit to us that in times like these we need this spirit we need this leadership we need this comforter we need this person in our lives connected with our lives and we should do all that we can to cultivate that relationship to make ways for it to move in our life to set aside time in our life to make contact with it sin alone be still and know that I'm God just don't always do the talking sit back and do some listening he's provided something to us that we need to make contact with without the spirit the letter killeth many people have quotes and they use quotes and they're out of context they're out of spirit they're out of place they're not even spoken in the way that they're spoken and then they try to use brother branham's ministry to vindicate their using of the quotes and the only thing that bears witness is the spirit so if you don't have the spirit then you're gonna have trouble with the record that we just read in Finnish here oh it's such a marvelous thing and yet it's so simple if we would just stop and think we press we quiver we fear we get in frustration and doubts just thinking well must I press in it isn't that it's just yielding see realizing that you're nothing and just let him completely take you over take over your thinking take over so that he's provided something he's provided the spirit of comfort he's provided the spirit of truth he's provided this faithful and true witness but what good is it to us if we don't yield to it if we don't realize it's there if we don't understand this is what I've got to make contact with I'll tell you and I hope I don't sound rude and in anything look I think it'd behoove us many times before we start reading our Bible just to spend a few moments to get into the spirit before we take up a message to spend a few moments to get into the spirit because that spirit is what's going to lead you and guide you into all truth that's the spirit that's going to show you I have many things that you cannot bear but I'm going to send you the spirit I'm going to send you the comforter and he will show you these things he will reveal these things to you it's so important as we're going forward from this hour in these times to make sure that we get our lives in the spirit it's important to be in the spirit he said now I don't mean to walk up to Christ with just a blank mind I don't mean that you come to him in your right mind in a penitent mind and humble and say Lord Jesus Here I am Lord Jesus here Emma now it's written here in your Bible that you had many things yet to say to the disciples you said they could not bear them now and he says then perhaps that's our case we cannot not understand them you'll just think for a moment God can raise up a little something different altogether we denounce it instead of searching the Scriptures to see if it's right or not we just quickly throw it away there's nothing to it now let's don't take that attitude to what's going on this is going to change I think we need to search the Scriptures and see what is in it what is it witnessing what is it testifying to and what is the Spirit of the Lord saying about it see what's gonna happen we know it's going to change things man's gonna make adjustments you know and then you're probably gonna see you know someone's standing at doors wiping knobs and and all kinds of stuff is going to change there's going to be all kinds of help things change food things and restaurants I don't know all the changes that are gonna be made but there's going to be changes well there's going to be changes in the attitudes of men to ya know I can tell you personally every time I see something like this come they've we've already got to the place we do away with babies well you know I'm 70 years old and I'm looking at a world that's pretty soon wants to get rid of the elderly and all these things are just the mind when all this has done all this problem was caused because the elderly were the people that died the people that had underlining health things they're the reason that society was such shut down they're the reason that we went into this great world thing that was who died they were the weak and they couldn't do it you say oh that's that nobody will accept that thinking you better go back and study Hitler Hitler convinced the world that the Jews were the problem of the economic failure and of sickness because they bred like rats and by taking them out of the society that they would fix the social problems I'm telling you there's there's something else that's going on here there's a change in the way that people think there's a change in the man's approach and this effect is going to have an effect on their thinking and it's going to lead to something and if you don't have this spirit of truth you can be very easily swept away now we just quickly throw it away there's nothing to it we ought to search out these things find out whether they're right or not and remember if they're not right they will finally die for jesus said every plant that my heavenly father hath not planted will be rooted up but I think it was gamellia that made that great statement that time if it be of God we don't want to be found fighting against it if it not of God it'll come to naught anyhow so study it and think of it so even the words that I'm telling you I'm talking today about something that God's provided for us and now he said in here but when the Holy Ghost is come now someone said one time it's been speaking said the Holy Ghost is actually your mental mind you think that would put the Holy Spirit a thought but the Bible said when he and he is a personal pronoun see when he the person the Holy Ghost God comes he will reveal these things to you that I've told you then you see there's no other way of knowing what is truth you cannot get it by culture by seminary experience you'll only get it by the Holy Spirit he is the one that's been sent to reveal it now then he also said he will show you things to come now Hebrews the first chapter said God in son died times in divers manners spoke to the father's through the prophets by but in the last days by his son Jesus Christ it's the Holy Spirit taking over possession and taking possession of the church to operate Christ in the church then you become as he was he became as you was so you could become as he was see he became you that you might become him that it's above understanding there's no way to explain it you don't try to you just accept it he spoke it that settles it just right it's that way so we sit back and we understand we've been promised of faithful and true witness you know we've been promised the comforter we've been promised the Spirit of God we've been promised to something to lead us and guide us into all truth and righteousness oh it means so much to us that we understand that we have this at our disposal could you imagine somebody that had a garage full of toilet paper and they're not going to use any of it in case they run out oh you want me to put it the way the prophet of God put it he said it was like a little mice in the Garner's of Egypt so you starve to death when it's all there fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom I'm trying to say this spirit is here with us because he's a faithful and true witness he said he will come and bring you in remembrance of all things that I said all the things he said through Paul all the things he said though Luther all the things he said through Wesley all the things that he said through our messenger he's here to bring you in real and remembrance that's why you can't put a minister in between you and the Word of God you must be filled and burned again that's what he said you must be born again in order to enter the kingdom of God you cannot know truth except by this spirit you can't be taught it it's got to be revealed you if got to be made personal to you and if we ever become to a place where we have church doctrine I don't mean true word doctrine I mean this is what we believe we should never be what we believe it should be this is what the spirit expressly spoke through the Prophet and by his son the Lord Jesus this is our source of life is this baptism of the holy spirit without this spirit all we've got is human explanations that don't lead they keep you still they set up camp and you can't go beyond their borders but we have Sunday meant we doesn't matter what's facing us it doesn't matter what the changes are we have been promised the Spirit of Truth the Spirit of Truth that he will lead us and guide us into all righteousness that he'll show us the path he'll be the light unto our way so we're not left in this I don't know where it's going but I want to know who's going to take me through it got to know I've got to have confidence in this spirit I don't want to have confidence I don't want this message to become academic where it's already been printed it's already on tape just say what it said don't you don't have to have no leadership of the Holy Spirit whatsoever no because the Spirit was promised to come and bring you in remembrance of what was spoken otherwise you're just seeking it by yourself otherwise you're just putting it on play and playing it over and over and over and over again let me tell you I hate to make this I may get criticized for this but without the Holy Spirit it can become dead letter yeah it's stored up but the Spirit is what leads us and bring us into remembrance of all the things that I've spoken and now you have a living relationship with the promise it's not a promise you have a living relationship with the promise you have a reliving relationship with the person that came Jesus Christ coming back in the form of the spirit to lead us and guide us it's such an important thing because you won't know the truth without that spirit because that's the person that leads us and guides us in to all truth and that's why it said when the Holy Spirit comes to call it Beelzebub there's no forgiveness that for that sin in this world in the world to come because you've you've cut off the life source that leads you and guide you so and I say this because I read these little things I want to say it to cultivate the relationship with the spirit to get used to coming into his presence to get used to seeking his face to tune your heart to the holy unction of the Spirit to be sensitive when he moves on the scene to realize he's there and he's leading us and he's guiding us not just to say oh he's in the volume of books and the volume of recordings that's the true unadulterated Word of God to me that's just the same as this Bible explained but it still takes this promise to manifest the life it still takes this promise to quicken the seed it still takes this promise to - to give us eyesalve that we might see to address us in fine linen to give us gold try it in fire it takes the working of the working spirit in our lives and I believe that this this great thing that's happened is a knock on the door that he can come in and sup with us it's the spirit staying to the church I want to come in and and take back over the leadership of your life doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong it's just that he's the one that he wants us yield to so if you're just yielded to the pages of this book by the intellect of your mind and by a conclusion that you've came to this is truth I believe everything it says but you must have the spirit bring it to life you must have that quickening spirit leading you and guiding you through the Word of God you can't separate spirit and truth they've got to work hand-in-hand so let's just take just a few moments and look at this faithful and true witness this comforter that he had from the beginning of creation of God what is he to us he's faithful and he's true so look if we just take a moment just to look at this spirit and and think this is what he's giving me it's something that's faithful you know somebody who's faithful and a true witness is somebody that'll always show up the spirit will always show up for you I will not leave you nor forsake you but I'll be with you I will come I will come to you so he's always he always shows up that boy I can trust somebody like that huh he he tells the same testimony he don't give a different testimony one time in a different something other time if you don't know you know that he's faithful you know that he's true you know he will always show up and you know you'll always speak the truth he'll always say the same thing you're not gonna get something one day that's gonna confuse with one mother day he's faithful he's true he's going to say the same thing he's going to have the same testimony he's never going to give a false report there's one thing God can't do and that's lie he's faithful he's true he's always going to tell you the truth you wouldn't count on it we're talking about being led now we're talking about we're moving into a time of the church where we're going to have to leave intellect and we're going to have to move into the leadership of the Holy Spirit's not outside of the word through the word the leadership of the Holy Spirit through the word not by sensations not by emotion but by the holy unction of the quickening power of the word being made alive Christ being made alive in the church as we just read he's always on time it's not early he's always on time when it's useful when it's needed that's when he shows up he doesn't show you something and then you forget it no he's right on time he's made you a promise I'm not gonna leave you I'm a faithful and true witness I'm the beginning of the creation of God ask anything the father of me for the father knoweth what you have need of even before you ask he's always on time this leadership that's got to come into the church the prophet of God preached leadership one of the last messages he left the church was that to give the church the understanding that they were going to have to come into this leadership of the Holy Spirit not oh I just don't know if I can say this without getting in trouble but not just the leadership of these pages that places you but yielded to the spirit so the spirit can bring you into remembrance and quicken these pages to you and be made alive for the moment that you're in that's Christ being made alive in you so he's always on time and it's always useful what he leads you to and what it gives you is something that you can use it's not just data bank sitting back and saying oh that's true that's true that's true it's like me going in my toolbox and I open my toolbox Oh pair of channellocks it's nice but it's not what I need it's not what I need to use it's not the job that needs to be done I've got to have this for this job well the faithful and true witness is always on time with what's useful he always provides proof always vindicates his proof always gives you eyesalve that you might see always opens it up it's wonderful as we realize my life I've got to examine myself right now and realize that there has been a great contrast in our country and in the world that things are changing and I can no longer rely on the way that I presumed things to be I must make contact with the one that's going to lead me and guide me into all truth and righteousness he always provides proof he always shows that what he's led you in and what he showed you has worked out has God ever showed you to do something and you did it and it was exactly the right thing to do the right thing to say the right way to handle it that's the kind of God we serve you know he got to become living in our lives because the more you you have men and their ideas the more you're going to have differences you're gonna have a thousand carnal explanations for what's transpired I don't know if I understand what's transpired but I do understand that God has sent us the Spirit of Truth to lead us and guide us and that he always proves what he reveals to be true amen his testimony is simple clear and easily understood he's a witness he come to testify of him he says he will be my witness and so shall you be my witnesses in all the world so these things also apply to us simple clear and easily understood it's always revelant to the case at hand to the situation it is it's not just coming up with some thing over here some teaching that doesn't apply I mean but it's always revelant it's always to what we have need of the food that comes out of the storehouse by the Holy Spirit is food if something to be digested something to supply life and and can and move our spirit in the direction of the image of his son so it's revelant and relevant to the situation it's spiritual food in due season it is not carnal man bringing it in and so many times it's easy for us as carnal man because we have so many books in so many tapes and so many things for us to go grab anything off the shelf and preach a truth and a doctrine and it be true but it may not be relevant to the condition of the people and that's what the church world is doing the nominal church world who no longer knows the father because he's on the outside trying to get in but he said if you will open up I will come in and I will sup with you I will feed you the evening meal I will feed you word that you have need of not just a sermon but life and truth I said my body is meat indeed and drink indeed is food its life mmm and so a faithful and true witness always doesn't show up with a testimony that doesn't have anything to do with the case it's relevant it's important to the outcome and they I say this the witness of the holy spirit of truth and righteousness in your life is important to the outcome I know it's easy for us to say I'm predestinated I'm see I have eternal life but if you have eternal life then you have a path that God's foreordained for you to walk in because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by the Lord and if you get out of that order then he chastises you and rebukes you to correct your path to work it back around to his perfect will so it's not saying oh I got the word I don't need the Spirit the word without the Spirit is dead and that what the Jews had they ended up having the law but they didn't have the fulfillment of the law which is the Spirit of the Lord I would hope to not that we wouldn't get to the place that we say we have the message we've got it in form but until the Spirit makes connection with the life of the believer and starts quickening that word to them revealing that word to him speaking that word to them proving that word tune never giving a false interpretation of that word then it doesn't live and you know I'll tell you one thing about this true and faithful witness it's an expert in his field he knows what he's talking about I am the faithful and true witness because I am the beginning of the creation of God I am your faithful and true witness because I'm the one that drew the program remember the man with the carburetor he said do this and do this he says how do you know well I'm the designer for it I built it you understand he built you and my sheep hear my voice and another they won't follow he built you he knows you he knows what he's Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the beginning of the creation of God the faithful and true witness he knows that he only bears record to the truth there's only one thing he witnesses and that's the revealed Word of God he's not witnessing to go build an ark he's witnessing the word that's here to feed us now we've got to be in tune with this spirit well got to come in deeper contact God's provided a way of comfort leadership in truth and it's the truth that sets you free and I say this that we must renew our contact with the holy spirit can't be afraid of it it may chastise you but no chastisement feels comfortable yes and don't substitute an intellectual conception of the historical facts and vindication of brother branham's ministry that he was a prophet that is a historical fact that's more true to me than George Washington crossed the Delaware but it doesn't eliminate the movement of the Holy Spirit in our lives ok these are the things that he testified in Joshua oh 1 5 in their Hebrews 13 85 he said I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee so he's not gonna leave us now I'll not leave you comfortless so when we faced this hour when we face the changes that are gonna come when we're going to face the changes in our jobs but some of us may face layoffs some of us may taste many different challenge just remember he's given us somebody to lead us through go there first spend time there let him speak to your heart and you will find that he's got counsel for you because he's the counselor he's the mighty God he's got peace for you he's got joy for you he's a living person the Lord Jesus Christ with us in spirit form to lead us and guide us in all truth and righteousness and so this morning if we could bow our heads and and I just ask you this morning to consider in examining yourself if we need a renewed contact with the leadership of the Holy Spirit in our lives if we need to become more sensitive to the unction of the Holy Spirit if we need to inclined our ear to his voice if we need to give him time in our life set aside time for counseling set aside time for worship that we understand we have a storehouse full of food vindicated and proven we have a message that's been spoken but now we need that Holy Spirit to make it alive we needed him to feed it to us day by day he promised that it'll be with us and even in us till the end so maybe at home if you've been listening maybe you've realized that this is a great call by the spirit to the church to let them know that things could change in a twinkling of an eye to let us know that the future has changed and man's going to change their course but God's the unchanging God he's the faithful and true witness his witness has been the same before the stars ever were hung in the sky and he said I'll take you through children come unto me all that are heavy laden and I'll give you rest I will not leave you comfortless but I will come again and be with you even in you and I'll lead you and I'll guide you and this morning if you've been away from that guide if you've been so busy in life that God had to stop your job just to get you to listen may as we read that quote may you just sit and say Lord Here I am Lord here am i I'm here for you to speak to me I'm here to you to take the leadership of my life I'm here to cast my cares upon you for you careth for me and I'm here father to ask that you would instill once again in my life the leadership of your Holy Spirit so once again
