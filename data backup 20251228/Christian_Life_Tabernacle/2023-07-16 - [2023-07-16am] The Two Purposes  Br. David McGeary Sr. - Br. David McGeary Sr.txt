Lord in Jesus name we pray amen amen good to be in the house of God Amen I want to welcome everyone and all our visitors God bless you this morning turn around and welcome someone this morning amen a man will fight for the night before I saw him reading this morning amen God bless you and have your seats I'm grateful for the rain this morning it arrived in time for church right on time you know I don't know about you but when I read the scriptures and I see the scriptures repeating itself if there's ever a phrase or a statement or whatever that it repeats itself it usually causes me to stop and pay extra special attention you know we know that all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable that's what II Timothy 3 16 tells us every word every statement inspired by God so when he repeats himself it causes at least should cause us to pause a minute and see what he's putting his emphasis on so you know when you read that he repeats himself 26 times in one particular passage of scripture that's going to give my attention when we read Psalm 136 there's something that he repeats 26 times at the end of every verse something's being emphasized here and catches our attention he says this at the end of every verse he says for his mercy endureth forever it's an entire portion of scripture devoted to thanking God for his continuous constant unending mercy you know we might read this scripture and kind of dismiss it as well it's you know it's a worship song they you know like any song even that you might hear today it often will take the same phrase and repeat it several times to create an atmosphere but this one made it to the scriptures where all scripture is profitable we're all scripture is given by inspiration it opens in verse one o give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever and it ends in verse 26 o give thanks unto the god of Heaven for his mercy endureth forever but what caught my attention were the verses in between because every time the psalm mentions God performing a work it follows that work with the statement for his mercy endureth forever you know that little three-letter word for is a big word it means because it's the word used to connect an action with the reason or the purpose behind the action [Music] it means for this reason for this purpose I got up this morning I put on my Sunday best and I got in the car for church this morning there was a reason there was a purpose so when we look at this resume of works that God has done in Psalm 136 and each one followed by the statement for his Mercy endureth forever it's more than just a phrase from a two thousand year old worship song it's the continuing reason or the purpose behind his working let's look at a couple of examples in verse 4 he doeth great wonders for his mercy endureth forever because his mercy endureth forever the reason he does the Wonders is because of his Mercy family the Wonders or the actions The Works he performs his Mercy is the reason he does it it's the motivation it's the purpose behind the work in verse 5 he made the heavens the Heavenly Realm because of his Mercy in verse 6 he stretched out the Earth above the waters because of his Mercy it's not because of our science or politics that holds this world into place it's because of his Mercy that's right amen do we go on and read and describes all the works that God did he smote the firstborn of Egypt he brought Israel out from among them he divided the Red Sea to provide a way where there was no way because of his Mercy he used that same way to overthrow their enemy he led his people through the wilderness he defeated great Kings and then he gave Their Kingdoms to his people because of his Mercy he did it all because of his continuous unending never failing Mercy every work that the Lord performed is his Mercy in action and here's one I think we can say Amen to in verse 23 he remembered us in our lowest state and redeemed us from our enemies because of his Mercy it's not because of our family it's not because of our intelligence or of our goodness or our nationality there's no reason at all because of his Mercy it's what caused him to do his work Mercy is his work everything he does every work he performs is because of his continuous Non-Stop Mercy think of it he has to do nothing but by his Mercy he performs work it's a very motivation for his work it's not something he offers and fits and starts you know be based on circumstances or based on how we feel or how good we've been his Mercy is a continuous Focus directed at a specific people all the work he performs is driven by his Mercy for these ones what people will the people of his choosing you know the Lord told Moses in Exodus 33 17. it's a it's a wonderful passage this conversation between Moses and the Lord he says I will do this thing also that thou Hast spoken for thou has found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name someone of his choosing he goes on to say I will make all my goodness pass before thee how many can say Amen to that amen and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show Mercy on whom I will show Mercy in verse 20 once again speaking to the one who he has chosen by name thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my Glory passeth by that I will put thee in a cliff of The Rock and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back parts but my face shall not be seen now this actually happens in the next chapter 34 6 and the Lord passed by before him and proclaimed the Lord the Lord God merciful and gracious long-suffering and abundant in goodness and Truth keeping Mercy for thousands you know when the hand of the Lord passed by when the work of the Lord Came Upon the scene what was declared in his passing was his Mercy for the one who he called by name and who had been placed there by him you know as I was reading that it became so clear everything he does every work that he performs is the manifestation or the Declaration of his continuing unending never failing Mercy for a people for those who he knows by name every work you know that means that no matter what our circumstance how we feel what situation we find ourselves in even when we don't understand it that is his work of Mercy it's his Mercy at work it's the place where we find ourselves when the hand of God is at work is that place of his Mercy are you grateful for his Mercy enduring forever let's stand this morning and let's read Psalm 136 together [Applause] starting in verse 1. oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever o give thanks unto the god of gods for his mercy endureth forever o give thanks to the Lord of lords for his mercy and Earth forever to him who alone doeth great wonders for his mercy endureth forever to him that by wisdom made the heavens for his mercy endureth forever to him that stretched out the Earth above the waters for his Mercy into Earth forever to him that made great lights for his mercy endureth forever the son to rule by day for his mercy endureth forever the moon and stars to rule by night for his mercy endureth forever to him that smote Egypt in their firstborn for his mercy endureth forever and brought out Israel from among them for his mercy endureth forever with a strong hand and with a stretched out arm for his mercy endureth forever to him and which divided the Red Sea into parts for his mercy endureth forever and made Israel to pass through the midst of it for his mercy endureth forever but overthrew pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea for his mercy endureth forever to him which led his people through the Wilderness for his mercy endureth forever Tim which spoke great Kings for his mercy endureth forever and slew famous Kings for his mercy endureth forever Sion King of the amorites for his mercy endureth forever an OG the king of Bashan for his mercy endureth forever and gave their land for inheritage for his mercy endureth forever even in Heritage unto Israel his servant for his mercy endureth forever who remembered us in our lowest state for his Mercy endures forever and hath redeemed us from our enemies for his mercy endureth forever who giveth food to All Flesh for his mercy endureth forever o give thanks unto the god of Heaven for his mercy endureth forever amen amen God bless you have your seats man aren't you glad for his mercy here man let's sing that song Count Your Blessings [Music] amen when Upon Us below you what time tattoo oh

name pray amen God bless you if you have your am I not on the batteries am I okay they told me I have to preach really fast because the battery is running low thank you I know all about my battery's running low too but I know the Energizer don't you hallelujah amen let's open our Bibles this morning and uh to Ephesians the first chapter and read a few verses there this morning and it will go into our service we like to welcome all our guests our our guests from Oklahoma that are building did I did I did you lose me did I go I'm okay oh they're gonna switch me all right I've been wired amen well anyway we have like our guests from uh Oklahoma and I was visiting with the brother the other day they're insulating the uh uh building over there and he he came and uh sat down began to talk with me and he said you know I I noticed that uh you you worked real hard all day long and everything and after this was Wednesday and he said and then after you worked all day long you you got up and preached the gospel he said how do you do that and I don't know you know I the whole gifts to get yourself out of the way and he said me says well he says you know I like this study and there's a lot of preachers like that he said when I when I asked the minister he said I don't even uh I don't I take the whole day off I don't even work and I thought man I was thinking of asking them to preach but if if he is going to take the whole day off I can I I don't know what to do you know what I mean so maybe if he takes half a day out like that maybe I could talk to him about tonight but I don't know I just ruined a service for him but I'm a firm believer in that scripture instant in season and out in season believe me I think a lot of the brothers will testify I promised the brothers I would do one thing one month I'm going to lay out every service a month in advance now uh the Lord can change anything anytime right so you know the little disclaimers that are written on the bottom is this is subject to this this is the subject to that it it certainly will that day also uh we we have uh some of Cindy Martinez's family in from Chicago and they fellowship with us and and listen online to some of the services and things and uh they're in the back we're all standing so they they don't stand out but anyway we welcome them and and there's kind of a really unique testimony there somehow they had heard about uh looking online they they ran across our service and they felt to listen to it they can tell the testimony better than I can so they were streaming the service and and I'll just be honest with you I'm not a big believer in streaming because it comes becomes a substitute and and but I understand some people get in this situation they need this dream is that time to quit already all right turn off your alarms turn off your phones before you come into the sanctuary thank you and uh so they're they're streaming and work having prayer uh for um you know brother brother Adrian and sister uh Cindy Martinez and were praying and they're listening and they say I wonder if it's the same Adrian and Cindy so they're listening to us pray for them online not even knowing that they were coming to our service I thought that was kind of unique and then they they found out they were and they've been listening and and they're wonderful people we really trust that the Lord speaks to their heart this morning you believe God's word this morning let's read this Ephesians we know Ephesians is a special book for us because the Ephesians is The Exodus into the spirit of God Galatians is a book that deals a lot with the carnal side of man but Ephesians is a book that deals with the spiritual side of man um and those two elements war against one another your flesh and your spirit are at War amen the flesh is contrary to the spirit and the spirits contrary to the flesh the spirit desires you to do things the flesh would never dream possible that's why we have to walk by faith in Revelation but let's read with Paul in writing this letter to the Ephesians and we know that scripture that we probably read over and over again in Ephesians you know you are our workmanship in Christ Jesus Ephesians 2 10 for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath foreigned that we should walk in them great Revelation but we're going to read the first chapter starting in the first verse Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are in Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ don't forget where that is it's in Heavenly places in Christ according as he hath chosen Us in him before the foundations of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us under the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasures of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us acceptable in the Beloved Heavenly Father we ask you to bless us in your precious name we pray amen God bless you you may be seated this morning we are certainly uh blessed to be in the house of the Lord and and you know I I sit in the back many times and brother Mike will come up and and give his exhortation and it is so much down on the lines of what that uh is on my heart that uh sometimes it's such an encouragement and a blessing to me but the if I had a title this morning I would want to entitle it the two purposes the two purposes and the word purpose means the reason for which something is done or for which it exists so you exist this morning for a purpose and that's where we're going in our sermon this morning is that we might establish a that part of the purpose that we are speaking this morning is we're also addressing the subject of our thinking you understand I we we are aware and we've been talking about filtering how that you've got to filter everything through the word of God and when it's filtered through the word of God every desire every dream every decision and everything is filtered through God's word so what does the word of God do what's a filter do it takes out all the impurities all the deceptions all the uh uh lies and half truths and all those things when all those things thank you when all those things are filtered out in all you have on the other side is pure word then you have nothing but the Holy Ghost that's what we want nothing but the spirit of God nothing but the Holy Ghost and we live in a very complicated world now uh this is the most deceptive age that there has ever been there's never been an age as deceitful as this age and part of that deceit is that Satan appears as an angel of Light that we don't recognize what that means Satan appearing as an angel of Light Eve never meant to to disobey God her intention was wow I can be like God you know and and as you know the expression has been expressed to us that the path to hell is paved with good intentions correct all right people have good intentions I have a burden I have a desire I have a burden to do this I have a burden to do that but it's not a filtered through the word of God the intention is good and the scripture told us that always seemeth right unto a man but the in that of that way is death in other words they look at their intentions they they look at what their desires are they they come up with all the great things that they want to do and they they want to express and and they end up doing God a service without it being his will and and it's not that man is evil but you've got to understand something your very makeup your very nature is that man's heart is far from God and our thinking is not his thinking he sees the beginning for the end in other words he knows why he created everything and the way that he created it [Applause] Amen in other words does our brother expressed he had a purpose in doing something he had he had a reason for which this whole thing exists now we want to get these things in our thinking this is not just a random uh life we're on this evil age that we're living in has been prophesied it has been told us that Satan would appear as an angel of Light that men out of their goodness of their heart would try to do God a service but that service never lines up with what his purpose was in the beginning [Music] you know so many times I'm just going to throw this in here it's on my heart so many times the purpose of the baptism of the holy spirit is missed you were born with the nature all right you came into the world speaking lies you you have a survival Instinct in you and the the way you came into this world was a result of your marriage or your union to sin we came into the world through sin the very act between man and woman the first act that way was in the garden between the Beast and a woman yeah whatever came from that that was that act of bringing us into this world was an act of unbelief and of course we understand that that that was a deception now we are not guilty of that if I could say it that way but we inherited that sinful nature we inherited our mind we inherited our thinking uh just our flesh itself the fact that it it come into the world speaking lies well it was built on a lie that's right the very existence of the act that produced the the flesh was built on the LIE so if that was the purpose of it and the nature of it was deception then we're actually born into that deception so deception becomes our nature our human nature is designed to be deceived and too deceived amen I think makeup's the biggest deception there ever is we heard the prophet of God said oh you look at those Ruby lips she said just remember there's fangs behind those things right making you know I won't go there that's about a two-hour sermon right there But but so you have this nature well the baptism of the holy spirit is the change of nature you've got that in other words a new Nature has to be birthed in you that's why you have to be borned again and we know about the seed that's in us but if that seed is not brought to life by a birth it remains in the ground and rods so it's got to be brought to life it's Dante and that's what the spirit of God does is it brings that seed to life and so many miss it because they feel the baptism of the holy spirit is the anointing and they put the emphasis on the anointing instead of the revelations the church has been built on anointing it's built on Revelation so many people get the anointing but they don't get the revelation we know that Pentecost Brothers Stefan they ran with the anointing but they didn't have the revelation of why that anointing was given to him the Holy Spirit did not come to speak of itself but it came to bring us in remembrance of everything that Jesus taught it always goes back to the word in there the word so we know this morning that God had a purpose and and we're ministering this morning out of the message Christ The Mystery of God revealed and and he says these things he says now for a text I want to take out of there for a text based upon the entire Bible I want us to title this Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ being the mystery of God revealed now I took it in order as a Sunday school lesson so we could all read together and have this Fellowship together this is not entertainment this morning you haven't come to watch me perform there's a lot better performers we have come this morning to Fellowship together there's no big eyes there's no little use I don't have some great Revelation that you don't have I I heard the same voice that you heard when I heard that voice it brought to life something in me that said this is the man of God this is the voice to our generation it struck me when I heard his voice I knew I couldn't tell you what it was like but I can say this my sheep know my voice and another they will not follow us there is no substitute for that voice listen to it in your life but he said here he said that until we're here to Fellowship together this morning now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back in the back part of God's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a Moon Star atom molecule or anything he was God but he exists but he exactly wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship Him now think of that I like that because now it gives me a reason why I'm here a purpose why I'm here you are not rats put in a maze to see if you can make it to the other side that's too much what religion is and then you're bound in fear if you make the wrong turn and then a man will insert himself in there as being the one to tell you which turns to make and you say okay if you say it this way or you say it's that way oh I'll just follow that connect with the purpose there's two purposes who connect with the purpose he says so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed in him was love in him was to be a father in him was to be son in him was to be savior in him was to be healer and all these great attributes we see already expressed were in God so God had a purpose right he had a three stage purpose so we know that God has a purpose so that's the one purpose but there there there was another purpose that was inserted and and that purpose is uh described in uh Isaiah the 14th chapter and the 12th verse so we know that all through the scriptures there was always twins in every Revival they're even in the beginning there was light and there was Darkness and God separated the light from the darkness every place that we go in the scriptures we can find that there's always been twins there's always been two Vines because there's there there's what's Cain and Abel there was Jacob and Esau there was Jesus Jesus in Judas there there's always always to uh opposing an opposite voices another way I could express it was the law of contrast that God had to allow one thing to be there to contrast the other else everything would be one great blur but so there's always been two so they're in the Garden of Eden and we know even before that that that in the beginning when the Angels fell and they were cast to the earth when when that Angel Rose up when Lucifer rose up in the beginning he had a purpose he he wanted a kingdom he wanted an Eden and our messenger absolutely came and preached to us beyond a shadow of a doubt that Satan's Eden is here there is a God of this evil age so we can actually look out if we have any ice have at all and see the purpose of Lucifer is being fulfilled amen he's got something he's trying to accomplish and he wants to impose his purpose upon you if I could express it this hey he wants to make you a pawn on he wants to make you a servant to unbelief can you imagine become a servant to unbelief that you are are ruled by fear that you're ruled by doubt that you're ruled by hope instead of Revelation that you're ruled by reasoning instead of Revelation can you imagine me in that bondage because there's an evil spirit that goes about like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour who wants to capture All Mankind and make them slaves to build his City to build his Temple to build his civilization to build his kingdom and all of it's of the devil I don't I don't know it would be worse to be a a willing slave with the knowledge of it or to be a slave to it and not know it a lot how would you like to be worshiping Satan thinking you're worshiping God everything you pour into your life everything you do every work that you do everything you built for and come at the end of the road to find out not one bit of it was done for the purpose of God Amen I don't want to be deceived like that we all believed this morning I hope the majority of us understand whatever level of Revelations God's given you but the voice that we've heard in this day one of its purposes was to reveal the son of perdition it was to reveal the deceiver and his deception and how he works and what he does that there is a a an opposing Force an l a enemy that appears as an angel of Light I'll give you a way of Escape I'll fix your problem he's so deceiving it's frightening but we've got something that we've got to hold to and that's God's word so let's just read about just a description this morning of this other purpose how Thou Art fallen from Heaven o Lucifer Sun of the morning Isaiah 14 12. son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did weakened the Nations for thou hath said in thine heart this is his purpose I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God how many know what the stars of God are what are they they were the seven Messengers in the palm of the hand in other words I'm going to exalt myself above every message that these Messengers gave you don't think Satan is trying to exalt himself above this message you know what he did he infiltrated this message with make-believers he infiltrated this message with unbelievers they could pack the name they could pack the books they could preach in the gospel they could do everything and then when they fall like flies all it does is tries to give the message a dirty name all it does is confuse people all it does is break hearts because you wonder if the they never filtered the purpose I'll tell you you're obligated to your family and to your soul if you're going to sit and listen to my human voice you should filter every motive and objective in everything you ought to put me through the ringer find out if it's real right not a time for make-believe it doesn't do you any good to come to church to fulfill your obligation to church don't save you it's the being born again that saves you it's having a nature change that saves you to have him rise up in you that saves you listen to what he says I will have the stars of God I will sit upon the Mount of the congregation I'm going to rule over them and we think oh that's the Catholic Church no it's every harlot that's right that came out of her 200 000 demon demons turn loose on the bride oh how many demons do you think you've been fighting there's two hundred thousand demon demons after you this morning who wants to drag your soul to hell oh Don't Preach about hell that'll empty the pews praise God you've got to fight your way to hell you've got to absolutely reject and go over every barrier that God raises up to go to hell listen here he wants to rule over you I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high God of this evil age Satan's Eden god of the fecal age serving God is put out of the people's mind they no longer wish to retain God in their knowledge not not God there is a God God is his word in the beginning was the word you can't have God without having his word anything you call God that is not word is an idol it's just an idol whether you create your whether you create his personality you make him what he makes them that's why we've got so many filters today so many Church buildings that you can go into and they will filter the word and just give you the word that you like the osteins what what's the what was the reason for his success and why he has so many people that come to him and his answer was well we don't talk about hell um we need a good Hellfire Brimstone message you know that's that's how he gets them all in because this is the Bible we believe everything that's in it but you don't have to take off your earrings and your makeup and your paint and you can still wear your shorts and you can still make faith we believe everything that's in it every promise in this is mine and God loves me yeah he does you know but they don't like the part that loves corrective and people just gobble it up put all their trust in them that's not where I want to go that we're talking about this liar here because the most high now he says yet Thou shalt be brought down to Hell to the sides of the pit they that see thee shall narrowly look upon me and consider thee saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble and in shape kingdoms you don't that scripture is for us today the Son of Perdition has been revealed so we can narrowly look upon him and say this is the guy that's destroying kingdoms and shaking people the only thing that's ever going to do that's when you put the flashlight of God's word on them praise God there was a man here that could turn on the light that's right he said he said that made the world's as a wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that open not the house of his prisoners and the kings of the nation even all of them light in glory every one of them in his own house is this a guy do you realize right today he's destroying cities whole cities in our country look at Chicago Illinois full of demons full of crime full of everything used to be one of the most beautiful places along the great Shoreline and now it's gone to the corruption of uh I don't know what they call it they call it woke thinking but they're they're wrong it's luciferism you take San Francisco yeah it used to be called The Gem of the Pacific a beautiful place I've been there and now it's it's full of of people on the streets and and drugs and and everything businesses are fleeing from it by the thousands shutting down their stores they don't know what to do there's only one thing to do and that's repent amen they don't see what it is he's destroying this nation you don't think about a purpose he's got a purpose and I'll tell you those of you who got your children it can in public school I'm not against anything but you keep your eyes on everything they send home you go sit in in a classroom you let that school know you're there and you're listening oh yes don't turn them over into their hands they actually have men come into schools dressed as women and put on a show and all the kids in their innocence it's funny huh the seed of acceptance the seed of acceptance is being sowed if you don't filter that seed of acceptance out of your life he will give you by reasoning a reason to do everything that you do as contrary to the word of God as it is it will appear as light he's got a purpose his purpose is to be worshiped what was the one thing that Satan couldn't do create he couldn't create God had that power and God expressed that power I hope you get this he expressed that power by making them male and female right but he did he said I'll make them male and female he made the plants they have their own pollination and that they they have a separation he made all the animals they have a separation he had a way of bringing forth life and he made them male and female made he them and now Lucifer with his purpose of sitting upon the throne and being exalted of God he has now fed the world this whole idea of inclusion God is not an includer God is a separator [Music] and if you want to call it racist I am the most spiritual racist there is sin in life don't mix no don't get all so fancied up with the color of your skin because God don't care he's not a respecter of persons he looks what's on the inside and if he chose to express you in brown praise God if he chose to express you in yellow praise God in red praise God in Black praise God and why praise God the family amen but God's a racist he is and just for all you people on YouTube who's going to X me out we have all the colors here this morning and they're all amen and God's a racist you don't think he's a racist what did he do with Abraham he created a race and then he created another race of the royal Seed of Abraham God's always had a people get over it there's one that's coming Beck has got a purpose of being God I'll make a male and female I'll let the people in My Kingdom decide what they want to be if they want to change that's fine but I'm trying to get you to understand are you aware yeah of what's happening right because there's a purpose there's a purpose for all this it's the second purpose that purpose is Satan to exalt himself and sit on the months of congregation and raise into the most high that he could be worshiped and have an Eden and sit in it is the God of this Eden what did he use in the beginning he used Eve what is he using in this day the beauty of woman oh I hope you can see it our messenger laid it out over and over and over again but we're not we want to re-emphasize this morning just for a few moments if I could say this the real purpose there's two purposes one's a false purpose and one's a real purpose let's talk about our purpose this morning right so God had a three-fold purpose you understand that right so in other words God in his mind in the beginning had a purpose and that that was what that he had so God had a purpose or a reason for everything to exist he had a reason why something is done he had a reason why he created now we just listened to brother Brenham tell that he in him he had attributes and he wanted to express himself he wasn't even God there was nobody to worship Him so he wanted to have Fellowship God wanted to have Fellowship he had a purpose and so if we would look at paragraph 140. in the midst Christ The Mystery of God revealed known as God has had a three-pole purpose in this great mystery Secret God in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he has got a three-fold purpose in it now is there anything in you that's interested in what the reason for all this is that's what man the all psychologists find out that men are there for three reasons who am I why am I here and where are I going psychiatrists couches are filled today because they don't know where they're going and the anxiety of not knowing their future causes them so much trouble that they've got to take Xanax and Valium and and drugs and alcohol and everything they don't know who they are can you imagine sitting down in front of a guy and saying who am I and they don't even know who they are wouldn't it be wonderful if you could sit through down to a psychiatrist and he'd be honest with you and he'd say you know I'm a child of the devil and your lost as can be and my job is to take you to hell and get you to worship Satan would you come flying off the couch well if you're not turning off the TV you wouldn't come flying off the couch if you aren't turning off the radio and all that junk you wouldn't become flying off the couch because remember the scripture says with their mouths they do worship me but their hearts are far from me this is such an age of deception where the mouth can say anything but it's only the elect that have iceap so he got a three-fold purpose before the world began he's got a threefold purpose in it now we want to go upon that this morning what is that threefold purpose now I believe to help with the help of God who is present and he'll show it to us now if he had this threefold purpose we want to find out what this three-fold purpose we want to find out what it is first the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people first purpose of God he wanted to reveal himself amen now let's be smart this morning God creates Adam and Eve right they walk in the cool of the evening with them and they love him and they're talking together it's beautiful he can plant this move it here and he's got and they see God in all his glory and everything but they don't know him they only know part of him they know he's a father they know he's a Creator but there was no way that Adam could ever know that God was a savior that he was a deliverer and there was no way that Adam and Eve's offspring would ever know God any other way if they came the way that God had planned for Adam and Eve you understand that that's not too deep I hope so God looks at Adam and Eve he looks at all their offspring everybody he had in his mind and he says I tell you what I'm going to do I'm going to take all these people and I'm going to put their name on the Lamb's Book of Life nothing can put it on nothing can take it off I'm going to secure them in order for me to carry out my purpose of revealing myself amen so what's he do he says okay Philip way back he saw you before you ever got here before you or ever was a star in anything he put your name on the Lamb's Book of Life now he says fine he takes Adam out of Eve because Adam couldn't be deceived and he allows man to fall so here you're going through time you're walking with God you're in the thoughts of God but God allows this little dip in time brother Graham calls the little hickey a little niche where you drop out of that dimension into this Dimension and you take on a body of sin now God has always had your Eternal Body in his mind amen and praise God it's not this so you drop down now you're here through the deception of Saint Lucifer putting forth his program and his purpose of what he's doing in deceiving Eve we end up here now here we are but what why did God allow that not to put you on trial because if you have eternal life you always had it where was your eternal life it was in the thinking of God before the foundation of the world it wasn't in your works [Applause] because your filthiness is ranked and that's right when Jesus come he said all the father hath given me will come my sheep know my voice nothing will pluck them out of the palm of my hand when the disciples came back from the great works he said don't Rejoice because you Satan's were fallen and demons were cast out but Rejoice because your name was written in the Book of Life so we drop down here and we were lost now he can reveal himself make himself known his attribute known as Savior then we get sick that kid can make us attributes known as what healer we get in trouble now he can come show us he's a deliverer we get destitute and he can be Jehovah Jireh he can be a provider we're surrounded with the attributes of God Amen and we don't touch him we don't use them Satan has got us out of Fellowship but if we can get back and fellowship we find out he's all we need God sends his Spirit to bring you into fellowship and to re bring you into remembrance that he's everything that you have need of he's all I need so he he wanted to do that was his first purpose was to make himself known that's all you want to do is display all his attributes to let you know who he really is so we can look and see the invisible things of God are clearly seen in the creation around us we can see the beauty of nature we can see the great creative power we can see all the things that God's done it's beautiful now we got this perverter out here that's got a completely different purpose and he's trying to sell that to you every day filter it all so he had and now he's revealing all this other side of him all the parts we would have never known if he didn't allow us to come here but while we were yet sinners he died for us the minute he fell he said I'll put enmity between thy seed and the serpent seed yes oh I love it I love that he loves me despite all that I am it never was what I did if you can do one thing for your salvation Jesus Christ died in vain stay with me would you just a moment secondly this is paragraph 44. secondly to have the preeminence in his body of believers that is his bride that he might live in people that's the second purpose not only did he want to reveal himself but he wants to have the preeminence he wants to live in you right the second purpose wants you to acknowledge Him ma'am and do religious offerings to him he wants you to to to light a candle or or sing A Hymn or fulfill out a ritual of going to church in fact he'll even provide for you all kinds of different flavors you can be a presbyterian and worship God you can be a assemblies and worship God you can be all these things out here and worship God but that's not God's purpose God's purpose is he wants to live in you that's the second full purpose of God oh what love he didn't just put you down here like you're in a maze he wants to have preeminence he wants to live in you he wants you to know this that if the same spirit that dwelt in Jesus Christ dwelleth in me it'll also Quicken my mortal body what is the indwelling spirit of Jesus Christ it's the earnest of your Redemption it's the title deed to the abstract that you have a body waiting for you and that you have a place in another kingdom how do how do I know that because the the I've been made join heirs I've got the I've got the title deed I've got the word of God I've got his presence in me he's dwelling in me church if you don't know he's dwelling in you please find a closet somewhere and pray through till you know that he walks with you and he talks with you that you've applied the token don't let your flesh tell you it can't be done right if your heart doesn't condemn you he is greater than your heart he's greater than your flesh his flight your flesh will war against you all the days you know why because your flesh knows it's not going oh I ain't taking this bag of bones with me Jerome it gets stiffer every morning and starting to wobble and Shuffle it's starting to fade away but I pray to God there's something on the inside that beats stronger and a harder and more for him oh God I want to serve you oh God I want to be like you oh God I want to invite you into every corner of my life I want to be a little Messiah paragraph 155 second to have preeminence by this in his church which is his body the bride till he could have the preeminence to express himself through them he I can't even believe it God wants to excuse this chunk of clay this person that had all this darkness and in them and his love is so great that he's willing to come in and wash all of that away throw it in the sea of God's forgetfulness to be remembered no more to wash me and cleanse me with the washing of the water of his word and then use this redeemed body to live in and express himself through every single one of you in every Walk of Life every condition every situation I'm pretty sure he's got almost every situation of Life covered in this one room and he wants to express himself through you thank you Lord that's his purpose that's what he wants to do he wants to express himself and now his third purpose and thirdly to restore the kingdom to its right ly position that fell from sin by the first Adam back to where he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talking with them fellowshipping with them now sin and death had separated them from his presence and his entire and his entire expression do you read it before the foundations of the world to express all of his attributes that he was he wall the church let's don't miss the rapture let's don't miss it don't sell out oh yes now let's just close this morning and talk about us we've been talking about thinking right so we're trying to once again this morning to reach out to end to to stimulate our thinking to get us to think the right way so this is my lesson this morning this last few minutes I want you to understand there's two purposes going on one is Satan trying to rule over you build an Eden be a god and have you be his slaves remember the what one of the descriptions of Lucifer he wouldn't open his prisons he won't let you go and you cannot unlock the cell you were doomed to start with but one came and he'll open the door don't be like that Crow that was tied to that string and he had set up a lifestyle and a thinking and he could only would go so far and then when the string was cut he was free but he wouldn't fly I feel we got too many that are free but won't fly they won't fly in the heavenlies they won't fly to get Vision they won't fly to get revelation they won't go to where no man has ever gone before some of you might have caught that but don't you think all that stuff's out there for a reason the world screams the gospel to us and what is lady osia give me I Sav that I might see give me clothes that I might be clothed because he that hath a what ear let him hear no we're talking about our thinking this morning and in closing with this remember Esau right he says they're like Esau he said they're like he saw outwardly okay eat Esau was religious on the outside and when it come to religion it seemed to be more religious than Jacob was he seemed to be a better man than Jacob was but on the inside of him what he was he was elderly religious but his thinking was not filtered let me say it again don't let your thinking go unfiltered amen don't let thoughts run through your mind don't draw conclusions don't draw perceptions don't look at things and think it's the way that it is it's only the way that God's word says it is I don't care if Satan appears as an angel of Light when Satan appeared to Martin he appeared as an angel and he said Martin I'm your lord Fall Down and Worship me act in the presence was there and the light was shining in the room and it was glorious and Martin began to filter it right could this be him is this the hour is this the day is this the time and he filtered and filtered and filtered until he saw one thing he had a crown on and he knew that Lucifer wanted to sit on the fence of the congregation he wanted to exalt himself as king of kings and he said wait a minute that crown doesn't filter and he said get behind me Satan because the bride shall crown got a filter now listen to Esau our knee is religious but his thinking was not filtered he didn't think right of the birthright he didn't think that God that the birthright meant as much as God said it did there he was said I'm hungry what difference does it make about the old Birthright you can have it if you want it oh my God if I was to ask you this morning I hope I don't seem angry or anything but my soul is screaming inside of me not because of you because of me because I see how short I am and I see what's at stake how many of you know what your Birthright is that you could describe to me and say this is my Birthright so many people go back to Pentecost and think his powers and gifts your Birthright is your election that's what your right Birthright was you were born for the purpose you were elected and purposed to be here to be the elected lady that's why you're chosen that's your Birthright but like Esau like Cain like Judas they didn't think right to the birthright they didn't ever comprehend what it meant to be elected and chosen of God that's the birthright and when the thinking is wrong towards the birthright then you throw that Birthright away for every little thing that comes up you compromise on the word of God but this Eve if we would just read with me in paragraph 163. now what is his purpose now today to express himself as a son see and now that in him might dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily I'm I've got Colossians lying here right here before me see that all through the scripture that's what God's purpose was then all through this life of his son his cross the blood is saying here of his cross that he might reconcile himself a body a bride which is Eve the second Eve and God give it in type like he did Moses and all of them the same thing that he did in Adam and Eve giving a type that that they were Christ and the bride and his second Adam the church is the second Eve oh now we begin to we begin to to understand something we're the second Eve here we are the second Eve that's our purpose the first Eve what she compromised on the word of God but what's the second Eve going to do she's not right no don't pit yourself deceived by thinking if you believe that William branham's a prophet of God and that he's the messenger for this age that automatically means that you haven't compromised I've been places and had people sit down and overhear their conversations about William Branham comparing themselves to them oh one guy's going on old brother Brenham had a resident gift in other words our gifts just come and go but brother branham's gift stays with them all the time do you think that might be because he was born to prophet and he was the messenger to the age and you've been elected to hear it thank God they write books about them they use them all the time they quote from his messages but this election [Music] our Birthright this eve will not compromise let's read paragraph 174. predestinated let's go back to 163 just for a second a bride he said this church is the second Eve and as long as the second Eve compromises against the word she's doing the same thing the first Eve did trying to say well it was for some other age well we'll get to that in a few minutes whether he said that it was for another age how can it be for another age when he's the same yesterday today and forever but God has a purpose and hid it from The Eyes Of The Prudent and wise and revealed it to the predestinated babes who were predestinated to receive it now she's not going to compromise because this Eve is put to the same test now if we think right about the birthright and we understand why we're here we're here not to compromise on the word of God not to make any reasons not to not to filter the word of God out but to filter everything through the word of God so if we find ourselves here we find out that there's all kinds of things we compromise on what happens if I threw out work on Sunday that almost chokes half the everybody to death and I know I'm not the one that said it I'm usually the one that sits down and says well if you've got this problem and you got that problem I understand and you got an ox in the ditch you know what I mean and and because I'm a pastor and I love you and I try to make it as easy as you can but it's not my call it's your call and you're the one that's got to stand up and say wait a minute this is what the word says I don't care what the world says about it I don't care what the outcome is I'm like Shadrach Meshach and Abednego oh King live forever but I am not going to bow to that Idol I wish you no ill I I wish you no harm but as for me and my house we're going to serve God they wouldn't eat the king's bread they would need unkoshered food they wouldn't fall down to nothing they were determined to be princes of God's word he said fire it up boys seven times hotter I don't know how they get it seven times hotter the only thing I could do is they've started those bills going you know what I mean that flame is so red hot the guards went up there and opened the door and perished but they were without compromise why they weren't going to defile Israel they weren't going to defile their Birthright they weren't going to file who they were and where they come from that they were the Royal Seed of Abraham that they served the one in living god Jehovah and they walked into that fire and who was in the fire to meet him but you know nowadays before we go into the fire everything in the world's there God says be it your post to duty every reason I've watched it over and over and over again people move to where there's no church and they perish their intentions are good they got all kinds of reasons they got all kinds of this they got all kinds of stuff I had a person tell me one time he says well I told them I would I said it's contrary to the word of God don't do it well I told them I would you gotta be kidding me go tell them you lied that you're a liar you were born in sin shaped iniquity and you came into the world speaking lies I'm sorry I lied to you I told you I'd do something I can't do is contrary to the word of God all in all we wrinkle it around because our Birthright doesn't mean anything to it we don't know why we're here we're here not to compromise on the word this second Eve is not going to compromise we've all we're all here for one purpose it's to tell the other purpose I'm not part of you I've got a purpose that I'm here for and that's for Christ to live through me [Music] go ahead and make your own testimony he don't change and that's what's wrong with the ministry they pass out filters so everybody can filter what they want to taste Church there's one filter for this day and it's the message that God sent through his messenger it was given to us to expose every other purpose than the purpose of the birthright we we read in thinking men's filter what the evidence of the Holy Spirit was the evidence of the Holy Spirit was drawing every thought through God's word filter that's the evidence that you've got the spirit of God and I I'm warning you I'm beseeching you I'm calling out to you with all my heart Church get a hold and have the right thinking to your election and Birthright ma'am some of you were born into it and had wonderful parents praise God others didn't but what determines that great election is that he put that seed in you that becomes aware by the spirit of God that hey I'm here for a purpose I'm part of his purpose for him to live in me and that's what he said if ye abide in me and my word abide in you then ask what you will because you are the word are the same he has the preeminence he's got the rulership you're a prisoner to him the world is dead you have nothing more you see the rest of the people living the way they do but yet you do not do it you're a prisoner you're yoked with him my yoke is easy he said your yoke with Christ with the word I do only which pleases the father and if you can't believe that I'm he then believe the word so perfectly noticed he said believe the works in closing this morning paragraph 63 what is his purpose now to express himself as a son see and now that in him might dwell the fullness of the godhead bodily and I've got Colossians laying right here before me that's I've I read that that's not what I wanted to read I want to go over to paragraph 184 I'm sorry 184 that's close and reading this predestinated there's the mystery listen now this morning predestinated there's the mystery he before Christ or anything else ever was on the Earth you see his great mystery that he chose the bride amen knowing Eve would fall from disbelieving the word knowing that she would fall but he would choose a bride that would not fall that would hold to that word regardless of what the rest of the world said about it there they would hold to that word they are predestinated to stand there the adoption of children by Christ predestinated the church to that great glorious stand what is she here for every job offer for everything that would take you away every project no matter what it is wait a minute he's first amen that's right I don't care you put God first he'll take care of everything out put God first that Widow put God first it came time during that offering she took those little might she had and she threw it in there and oh Lord the Lord said that's it see her great is her reward wherever the gospel is preached her name will be will will be mentioned you know what that gave her it gave her a place in what eternity the Widow who was able to take the last oil and the last bread and pivot to the man of God oh you don't think that was a man mind battle but he said thus saith the Lord you're truce will not run dry your Barrel will not be empty what happened to that God 's got things coming to pass in our lives and and and no wonder in lady osia he says I counsel thee to buy of me I have that you might see when we when our thinking disregards the birthright we've got the wrong thinking to our Birthright which is our mystery election in him yeah you don't fit in the churches you'll never fit you won't fit in the corporate world you won't fit on the job you've been predestinated to be an oddball you're not going to win the Home Run Crown you're not going to win the Kentucky Derby you're not going to win Wimbledon but you can win the crown of life the gift of God wasn't riches he came to the poor of this world rich in faith the gift of God's eternal life through Christ Jesus his gift is his spirit coming in you that will Quicken you and change you out of this world that's rapidly falling he says now you see a secret to what to restore Fallen Eve as she was prefigured of the church and now notice as God opens up the sight of Adam and took out Eve by his own flesh and blood and divided his Spirit from masculine to phenomen to feminine he put it in Eve he took the rib from under aside and made Eve out of it it was God did the same thing taking out of the sight of Christ the blood and the water and Christ is the word and taking the word and making up his church Eve see back to himself again Redeemed by the blood that was come from his body you see it now God's great mystery now being unfolded it's been hid since the foundation of the world but Pete prefigured all the way down my Birthright this morning is to be Eve to be the feminine part of the bridegroom to become one with the word and in an invisible Union not to compromise to filter everything through to get back and and like Jesus said he says the kingdom is God is like a pearl of great price and when a man finds it he sells all that he has that he might possess this Pearl it's like a woman that loses the coin she sweeps the whole house out and garnishes the house and searches for it till it's restored and then she invites her neighbors and says that which is lost has been found what will a man give in exchange for a soul what would you give this morning for your Birthright what you're thinking towards the birthright I'm talking to myself this morning how how what what prize do I put on it what beauty do I put on a god you chose me low down wretched hippie sinner yeah with no hope at all of ever going anywhere but maybe the jail and you set me free not only that you revealed the light of the last day to me you let me see the seals open up you let me see you standing in your church ages you let me see the seven candlesticks and the Seven Stars you let me see the Feast of the trumpets and I I appreciate it Lord but that wasn't my purpose my purpose was to make an un compromising life that only did what the word said and to get rid of all my own thinking all my own decisions all my own things and become a prisoner to my Birthright Esau didn't regard the birthright and Jacob he wanted it I could go
