bashful about putting somebody on the spot so but if that happens I just wanted to throw that out there to say it but uh it's just a opportunity you know uh through the year uh you know services and different times and we always can't get everybody in but uh you know if don't let this be the only time that you sing so you know always turn in your request if you have a song in your heart and if we can work it in throughout the year uh we certainly uh want to do that but this is always a wonderful time for me to just enjoy the singing and and the fellowship and just the love that we have for the Lord and to sing pray praises to him I mean he is um isn't he been good to us amen and just think it hasn't even entered into our hearts or Minds the things that he has prepared for them that love them there's sometimes God's blessings are so rich I just can't think it gets any better you know you just want to scream you just want to be like brother John in the back when he gives that amen you know what I mean amen you know just you just ready to pop out of your skin you know what I mean and and uh and so I enjoy that and and the Lord really loves you so let's just stand and just dedicate

[Music] Fall there must be a reason for for it [Music] all Redeemer of the rain the Lord will never waste our pain he brings Beauty out of Brokenness and hope to our heartache healing out of every hurt that invades our shattered world we never walk through trial and he's the Redeemer of the [Applause] rain every problem that we [Music] face is sifted by the father through hands of Grace he uses sorrow to dra us to call us closer to his side it's in the middle of the storm we learn to trust that he is always watching over us Redeemer of the rain the Lord will never waste our pain he brings Beauty out of Brokenness and home to our heart healing out of every hurt that invades our shadowed world we never walk through trials in vain he's the Redeemer of the rain dark days we walk through

that's when they were free they could go free and those that couldn't see waited to hear the voice Hallelujah come down the hill that's right he is risen we are free and they turned back and said he is risen and we are free and finally it got down to us that he is risen and we are free right passed down through the ages Hallelujah till it come to our age amen and the great baton was put in our
