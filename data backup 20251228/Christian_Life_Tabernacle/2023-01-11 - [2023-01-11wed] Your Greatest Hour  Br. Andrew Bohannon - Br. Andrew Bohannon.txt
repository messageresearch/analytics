there's been much to overcome but here we are the songs of praise have gone forth and now we're ready to receive from him something that will make a difference in our everyday life you know we've come here to be tested and surely when you've came through those doors there's been some difficulties there's been some opposition that's come against us but we're here to receive something from the father tonight amen praise the lord we certainly appreciate the musicians and we're going to turn right to the word and I want to invite you if you want to turn with me we're going to the book of Deuteronomy we're going to be turning to chapter 8. we'll be reading verse 1. through verse 6. maybe before we read the scripture we'll have a word of prayer Heavenly Father Lord God here we stand Lord being led of your spirit to come to the house of God Lord this is your house of correction Lord many here Lord they need answers Lord they need leadership they need tutoring they need things that I cannot give them Father but you promise that you would lead us and guide us so father take control this service Lord bless hearer and speaker Lord that you would be glorified in this service as we committed to you father we desire that you'd bless our pastor and brother Matthews is away ministering we just commit ourselves to you Lord when we leave here Lord we want to have drawn Closer to You Lord more in tune with your spirit and more prepared o God to meet you in that hour Lord and and to be used for your glory and honor in Jesus Christ's name amen amen the scripture says there in Deuteronomy chapter 8 and verse 1 it says all the Commandments which I command thee this day shall ye observe that ye may live and multiply and go into to possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and thou shall remember all the ways which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness to Humble thee to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his Commandments or no and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with Manna which thou knowest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee to know that man doeth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord doeth Man live thy raiment waxed old upon thee neither did thy foot swell these 40 years thou shall also consider in thine heart that as a man chasing his son so the Lord God chasteneth thee therefore thou shall keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God to walk in his ways and to fear Him amen we trust the Lord will bless the reading of his word you may have your seeds we'll also have you turn in the scripture would take two more scripture readings and I'm just really thankful that the Lord has given us opportunity to stand before you to share our heart with you I know that me of myself I don't have much to offer but I got a promise you got a promise where two or three are gathered in my name he's in our midst amen so we're not looking to a man man's abilities man's inabilities we're looking to God to fulfill his word the scripture also that I wanted to take there is in John chapter 2 this is a familiar reading of scripture where they say this is Jesus first miracle in verse 1 it says and the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee and the mother of Jesus was there and both Jesus was called and his disciples to a marriage and when they wanted wine the mother of Jesus said unto him they have no wine Jesus said unto her woman what have I to do with thee mine hour has not yet come his mother saith unto his servants whatsoever he saith to you do it and there were set there are six water pots of stone after the manner of the purifying of the Jews containing two or three farkins apart a piece Jesus saith unto them fill the water pots with water and they filled them up to the brim and he saith unto them draw out now and bear it unto the governor of the feast and they bear it and the ruler of the feast tasted the water which was made wine and new not Winston was but the servants which drew the water knew the governor of the feast called the bridegroom and saith unto him every man at the beginning do have set forth the good wine and when men are all well drunk then that which is worse but thou has kept the good until now praise God what a wonderful story and I believe that we're living in the greatest hour for a believer I believe there's no day like today for a Believer to be sold out serving God giving is all looking Beyond this laodicea and what this world has to offer to press past all the barriers of humanity to press back all of the things of our thinking what we can accomplish what we can achieve and see what God has in story see it this simple simple uh little thought maybe if I would have a subject seemed like the Lord I was kind of um I was I was studying and this is what happens when you get a couple months to really get a bunch of inspiration I was listening to uh uh running from the presence of the Lord I was listening to is your life worthy of the gospel and um you know it's it's so much sometimes you feel torn like which direction to go you know but I trust by the help of the Lord that your need will be met this evening that your pull and receive something from God you know and I'll just say it like this in this great hour what God has done I feel like you know I'm I'm throwing myself out there I'm just letting I'm just gonna let it be what it is I'll just give testimony and maybe we'll start off like that but but this is your greatest hour I'm just going to talk about a little subject about your greatest hour and the scripture says there in Deuteronomy he says that he that he might make thee to know isn't that wonderful that that it's not you trying to figure it out but God is going to do something that he might make you know he's going to reveal himself he's going to reveal his plan to you and you'll know that man doesn't live by bread only you know this this became alive to me here recently in that in another layer when the opportunity to go to Romania come up and I thought my what a privilege it would be to to be able to just cuddle cut away from work and responsibilities uh at the home front and and go to to do a mission oh my you know I've been longing for a long time it's been a number of years since I've been able to go overseas and you know you get so caught up with with we got a mission field right here in our neighborhood you know we got a mission field at work you know so you just press in you got your eyes you know you're working you're doing your part but this opportunity raised in and uh you know we just commit ourselves into the hands of the Lord and I realize that you know in myself I may have been pushing back pushing back you know and and it isn't it something that you know the prophet would teach us he says you're in the perfect will of God when you're overseas doing Mission work with the word hey you know there's no gray area about that and we're looking to find the perfect will of God and here I am I'm going you know should I pray you know yeah I need to pray about this you know and so here I go I'm praying about it and you know the reasoning comes you know that's where the battle comes you know when Jonah see he was given a commission to go and cry out against something and he began to make excuses and he didn't want to face his responsibility I'm wondering if that's some of our condition that we've got things that we're facing but it's in our nature it's in our tendency to shuck our responsibility or to pass it off to somebody else but I realize for me I realize I come Square I'm facing now a reality you know I've I've been tasked you know with heading up a few things and you know have I just already trying to offer up an excuse you know hey this brother you know he can handle the this this and this all the burdens better easier but God calling you to handle the burdens you're facing God's calling you to face it and not just face it alone but face it with the word of God Amen to take it and say you promised it and I'm not going at this thing alone and so that's exactly what happened with me I was putting it before the Lord and you know the whole reasoning thing with work you know my schedule and this and that and the other and I come to realize that um you know as I was praying about it all of a sudden scripture started just coming into my heart and you know don't you love it that God deals with your heart by burden you know he'll put someone on your heart and all of a sudden you just it's coming in your heart and your mind and then you can do you know like I was trying to do and you can push it off you know push it out push it off but I want to encourage us today there's a benefit in facing our responsibility you know when we come face to face with the reality that God has entrusted us with sacred virtues you know he's given us the greatest message that ever dawned Humanity we're living in the greatest hour to ever be a Christian the power of God has been manifested clearly there's there's no Shadow of Doubt what God has done in this generation by the promise of God's word and now we stand here and we're facing decisions and a lot of times I feel like I sometimes just try to make the decision going through what I'm thinking instead of forgetting about what I think and committing it to the hand of God knowing what the word said and stepping out by faith because God is faithful and he's placed something in you you have the potential of faithfulness just to hold to the word of God and watch him bring it to pass you know so as as we put that before the Lord I just um you know it was heavy on my heart because I had kind of my way of thinking that this job was going to go a certain way and and I had it I had it in my control and this is the way you know things ought to be and and uh you know the moment that you set out to do the will of God you have opposition and that's where the test comes and this other message that I'll be pulling some some quotes out of is how can I overcome and you know I realize for us as Christians living in this day there's never been a the greatest hour to be the Christian but there's also there's never been so much demonic powers and Satan pressing us to try to hinder us to try to get us so busy or concerned with this life or to to be caught up in the way we think it ought to be and they're right and so that's what it was it was I was just going through I was like it's got to be this way got to be this way and finally I said you know what and and thank God for a Godly wife I asked her you know I said you know I'm not doing this alone you know and so she had said something that just struck a chord in my heart you know and it reminds me when brother Brown says I'm 55. if I'm going to do anything for the Lord I got to do it now and this urgency started just coming up on me like if I pass this opportunity and accept and and face the reality God's commissioned me he God's commissioned you and so I realized I can't wait another day I'm just gonna move forward just believe God Will Make A Way With the work he'll make a way because more than anything I want the will of God to be done in me don't you want the will of God to be performed in your life and so that's exactly what I decided I said you know what no matter what the outcome no matter how much Trials come my way no matter what the test is around the corner I'm going forward because you know it's one of those things just like the scripture says in Deuteronomy he says he's going to bring it to where you know that God is the one that that man shall not live by bread alone like what my job can do for me and so going out in faith I'll just say this I begin to see how that in doing his will things that seemed impossible when we were coming and traveling the obstacles that we were coming into they seemed so impossible like we were delayed and and then the next one was delayed and we didn't have enough time and just different circumstances but you know what happened God was part in the sea God was making a way you see I believe that God was teaching me as a son he was correcting me and I believe that every son that cometh to God must first be tried and and this it doesn't matter if you've just been serving one day 10 days 10 years it doesn't matter God is still child training us and and we still are growing and God is still revealing we hadn't all got it figured out ain't that wonderful that God still is making us to know him by Revelation by jumping out and saying I don't know how this is going to turn out but I'm just going to go forward because it's the will of God that I go and so as we were going I began to see the hand of the Lord and he was ordering these certain steps and coming in contact with different people and oh my the supernatural just was present and just so real and then I began to realize God forgive me for my unbelief Lord help me isn't that what you want you know I think that we have to face the responsibility sometimes we think we're already assuming a lot of responsibilities that in our nature we've pawned off or or passed by and so that's kind of the thing that started this whole thought you know in it I say this is the age of life you know we're living in a time where God has brought the personal life of Christ available to the believer we're not talking about just justification we're not just living in the days of Wesley of sanctification we're not just living in the outpouring of the gifts amen but now God by a yielded vessel by the cleansing blood of the Lamb to can come and pour himself into you that you can overcome you can overcome your thinking you can overcome your thought about the matter you can overcome what mommy and daddy's always taught us that is contrary to the word I don't know about you but I'm grateful for that I was taught a lot of nonsense I taught myself a lot of nonsense haven't you I mean this week let's be real you know there's the will of God to be we must seek out the will of God for our personal lives we all are responsible when we come into the presence and see God manifested and so come in such a way because the word of God he comes right to our address he's a discerner of our thoughts of our heart and when he comes by our way it's because he wants to he wants to give us a child training because look he wants to hand over the keys and say I want you to run my business you know sometimes we're just living by employee Faith you know oh what does the both say about this but we want to come to a place of maturity where he hands over the keys and says son what are you going to say about it what's your will on the matter and we've been tested and we've been tried and we've had the character shaping and and now we have a The Virtue and the molding of Christ living out in US amen so don't be surprised when you're coming through these different trials and the the enemy of the you know he's shooting those fiery darts at you oh I'm just gonna put my hands in and my heart into the the hands of God I don't understand it when I'm going through it you don't go you don't know what's going on but oh my you can look back you can see you're still here and God's merciful and he's worked certain virtues out in your life patience long suffering you know we have to be patient with God he's working his will out in our lives and sometimes why we want to be way over here you know but God's saying no I got some responsibilities I want you to I want you to take one step at a time with me you know sometimes we get ahead and we stream like I hadn't heard from God in weeks you know it's time to stop and go back say you know what maybe I maybe you said something that I just I just passed off and now I need to readdress this Lord have I faced this reality that you're trying to sanctify me in another way that I haven't given my heart over to Lord Jesus right now I just asked your cleansing by the blood and me putting it under the blood confessing Lord I'm wrong I need your cleansing power because I need to know you in another way Lord I need to I need to have Revelation again because that's the thing that gives us victory over sin that's how we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony God I'm wrong but you are right and your word says you put in in your situation what is the word promise for your situations you're sick Lord by your stripes I'm Healed you got you got lost loved ones you got children that are disobedient let's apply the token well I'm thankful to be a Christian I'm thankful that you know I didn't choose him but he chose me because if at the beginning I would have looked and I said I did say not me not me but aren't you grateful that he didn't just stick with what your opinion was he's he he doesn't he's not sticking with your opinion tonight some some of some of us we look down on ourselves but think about what he did when he lived such a life he said I sanctify myself for them he could have had a home he could have had he didn't even have a pillow to lay his head they asked him one time he said Master we want to go to your home and have some fellowship oh you know can you imagine how embarrassing he might have been what a reproach I don't even have a place but he did that he paid that kind of cost that you and I can have a home not just here but he said I go and prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also I just I'm so grateful that this kind of love just doesn't sit there and say I love you I love you I love you and you say well I believe it I sympathize with it but no when you really believe that he loves you do you know what you do you don't look at yourself the same you don't judge yourself the same because if my lovely Lord Jesus loved me so much when I was a sinner and he died for me you know standing there hung on a cross for hours and hours in darkness in bearing our shame in the nakedness bearing our reproach and even tell the whole world shook oh but praise God praise God when that temple veil was rent from the top to the bottom we're no longer bound to the law we're no longer oppressed we have a message of Grace amen we can break out of our own mindset of the way we think and what we our opinions of others in ourself it's time to look into the light of the Glorious gospel and take the responsibility I'm a son of the king I'm here to do his work I don't want to keep carrying on like I've always done today's a new day if there's something that's hindering you tonight you brought some baggage it's time to leave it at the altar say Lord my responsibility is to place this here on the altar that's right and I'm going to say Lord I need your help this thing's been on me for a while but I'm going to lay it down once I ask you for help I know my help coming from the Lord and every time the Devil Comes whispering to me to take up that old opinion I'm going to say my help coming from the Lord I've been bought with the price it's not in vain that he died you know I think that it's a time that we should constantly live in Revival that's what our messenger taught to never let the spirit of Revival die we must continually feed on the word I like that story about how they just did what Jesus told him he said you know my hour hasn't come yet but you know what they went and filled up the water I think God sometimes just simply asked us young people old people just go and feed on the word of God God is the one obligated to turn the water into wine it stimulates You by revelation you know that's when the real Feast comes that's where the Real Marriage comes is when you're in Union with Christ and he can come down and he could fill your heart with joy and peace knowing that he's in me he's he's setting me free the bondage is broken I don't have to live this way no more devil you're a liar get behind me Satan you have no part with me my God is the ruler of not only heaven but this earth right here you don't have no right to rule any part of my life and I'm I'm coming face to face with you Satan you bluffed me long enough and I'm standing here on the authority of God's word in the name of Jesus Christ you have no right I've been bought with the price you take your filthy hands off me for the glory of God and he must flee the Bible says resist the devil and he shall flee now don't forget the submission part submit yourself therefore to God see that's a power of the believer is just submission I can't do it Lord I'm just going to be brutally honest God look you that's the first step in Christianity is honesty do we have the courage to face the responsibility that we can't do it without him do you love the Lord he's so wonderful that he loves you and he's expressed it when he chose you showed it when he spread his arms and he paid the price that we can come fellowship with him and not only did he want Fellowship but he wanted you to know that he's put you he put the Conqueror in you so now you can go out when you're tested and you can look to his example you know Jesus gave such a thorough example because when he was filled with the spirit when the the Dove came down and it was upon him and John he said there he is that's the sign and he said the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world and immediately he was sent to temptation in the desert can you imagine when you just started thinking oh I'm just things are starting to get in order things are starting to go good and they Wham you're in a test Temptations all around you well that's a good sign that God's with you because every son that coming to God must first be tried chasing child trained the reason why you're being chasing is you're a son and a daughter but oh I thank the Lord that he just didn't overcome and not share with us how to overcome isn't that wonderful that he shared the example he and he didn't he he just said you know what in his great hour of Temptation 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness and the devil came up and you know he just said you're hungry brother Brandon called it three major assaults you know can you imagine when he comes assaulting you he's already assaulted our Lord you know he said you're hungry what he you know when someone's hungry I mean 40 days and 40 nights okay but I'm just talking about think about your world think about this world how many days you think they can go without some food before they start stealing and what's inside of them really starts coming out is it not even a week I don't know maybe a couple days I mean I've tried it I'm like man just tough but you know after it's fast he hungered this was this was no joke this was a real temptation you know when you're put on a fast you don't hunger the moment he got hungry now was a great Temptation he said now you you're hungry it sounds reasonable you're hungry turn these stones into bread oh my I am the bread of life you see man shall not live he went back to the scriptures he said no you'll know that man doesn't live by bread alone but by every word of God amen isn't there something starting to well up in your heart I need to live by every word of God I know that we know this but I trust by the help of the Lord we're catching a little bit of the gravity of our responsibility sometimes we just make decisions haphazardly but we ought not do that we ought to seek the will of God by just doing our part filling our pots with water by the washing of the water of God's word just being faithful to do what we're taught if you want to get closer to God you read your Bible and pray every day listen to a message these are the ABCs of our Christian walk right amen how many of us really do it God help me I'm guilty myself I need to face the responsibility there's something in you that you know and I know that God wants to reveal more of himself to us and through us because there's a lost and dying world out there and not just in our world but this world the world of our homes our job site you know you are the light of the world and sometimes just like in the message Shalom you know there was that that lunar eclipse or their soul I don't I don't know science very well but you know when the earth got in the way of the sunshine then the then the Moon it obscured the reflection of the Sun and sometimes worldliness gets in the light of The Shining Light of the Son of God in our lives we need to face the reality we've let worldliness creep in in our individual personal lives this is not me speaking this this is the word of God I am responsible to submit myself to the word of God and let God bring the tutor and correct me because I'm not only responsible for myself God has placed us responsible he said to to King King's like am I My Brother's Keeper what kind of attitude is that we're responsible to one another you know and so we're not running this thing alone you know we're in the ship together amen are you happy to be a Christian tonight to realize that God has given us an opportunity in the tests and trials that we Face to take us the responsibility to fight with the word not against the word not fight against the word of God's will in your life but fight with the word of God against the devil he said now speaking of in his great temptation he took him up into a high mountain and he showed him all of the kingdoms and he he tempted him and he said if you Bow Down and Worship me I'll give you all of these kingdoms he was trying to get him to Forfeit the world you know I wonder sometimes when we read these stories if we're actually just reading the story from the standpoint of his position are we personalizing it what is he trying to Forfeit you hey don't don't take the responsibility just forfeit that responsibility but see he was trying to get him to Forfeit it without the cross see it was the joy that was set before him that he can endure the cross and there are certain things that I believe we gotta we got a place before us so that we realize you know what we're not just getting beat down and we're not just going through struggles and trials without there being some kind of reward in that wonderful that you've been given so many precious promises that if you will take on at his word and walk in his way he's going to show and it's not by my righteousness it's because God the wickedness is going to be judged and God's going to have a people unto his namesake amen so just think about how he said now to he that overcomes not she because laodicea the age that we're in now she had a rebuke coming but there was a reward for the individual that's going to overcome laodicea I will grant to you now these are rewards we want to remember when we're finding a fight it's not you know the devil's picked up and there's all kinds of reward programs you buy the groceries here you'll get discount on gas you you charge here and you get this and the devil knows that you're motivated by rewards but where did he get that he's hybridized and perverted it God has a reward for you that those who overcome will be Grant to sent with me in my father's domain these the ruler he's going to have a queen hey man I just want to see him rule this Earth you know hey it's not going to be amazement to me when I see him ruling All Nations because he's done ruled this and if he can rule this I you know what he can do anything amen I mean you look at yourself in the mirror and the impossibility but oh my the cleansing blood Hallelujah the power of forgiveness to set us free ah and he who the son is made free you're free indeed Hallelujah and God wonderful well I tell you I was going to read some quotes and I didn't even know what time it is I think everybody's doing okay maybe uh 20 minutes so I feel that if I can read a couple of statements you know the the message man running from the presence of God I realized that a lot of times when God's commissioned us to go into all the world a lot of times you know we we sh we we fail to take our responsibility and like Jonah you know Jonah ran from the presence of the Lord and so with this responsibility you know he began to think you know and that's what you and I do we begin to think about overthink things you know like ah and and Jonah in his situation he began to think but he wanted me to cry out against him you know it's something sometimes when you have to call something that's wrong out you know everybody's your friend and you're popular and everything until something's done wrong and you can't hardly stand yourself yeah I cannot wait another minute that person hurt that other person in school with such and such or whatever you give the example how many times we got it on an everyday basis stuff's going wrong everywhere but you know what God has given us a responsibility to cry out against the wrong so that's what Jonah did he's you know he's a Jew and there he's going to the Gentiles and he's thinking oh my I can't go over there they ain't gonna accept this you know and this is a statement brother Brandon made and man running from the presence of the Lord in paragraph 46 he says In Jonah here was called on on this one of the Minor Prophets of the Bible to go down to this city and here we find an example of us all every one of us we always are running from something we run from trouble we want from responsibility we we're all prone to do it we are we are more prone to run than stand and face it see we find ourselves running sometimes we find ourselves prone to run from work we don't want to we don't want to work some people just think that they can make a living without working but I think Solomon it was said that if we could find here the answer and watch and the Ants and you know the little ants they tell if every ant doesn't work and lay in that ant doesn't eat in the winter either so everybody has to work and we've got so many things we have to do so much responsibility that we have to face everybody's got to face certain responsibilities and now if we just go down to paragraph 51 he says everything is responsibilities and it's so easy when responsibilities face us to shrink from them and we find that marriage is a responsibility in all manners even many times we find this is hard to say but it's true that ministers many times shook the responsibility of standing true to the word of God when it when they're confronted with it they'll shrink that though they'll shrink that responsibility when the true word of God is brought face to face with human beings and we are prone to shrink back until the last resource you know we're all in the boat right we're prone to this this is speaking of our human nature you know and this is the truth so we don't have to make excuses for it this is a Vindicated Prophet talking about our nature our Humanity we're prone to to shrink back from responsibility a if we don't have to work I'm just going to try to you know make a living you know by clicking on and it'll tell me how to make a living and then I feel like I did something but I still didn't move I'm guilty we're guilty but praise God we're not left without help you know I had a experience and and I don't know if I'll share the full details of it but brother Branham and the next uh paragraph he talks about his nephew and he had a dream and uh and he said Uncle Bill was standing there in this dream and as you started to preach then I woke up and he says Melvin he was talking he was Catholic he said Melvin that don't need no interpretation your place is down at the altar do you belong at the altar and I had a dream that I believe the Lord just begin to deal with me in that such a way you know when we're in Romania and uh you know I I had this dream and it woke up and and I sometimes will have these types of dreams but I was I was driving and while I was driving I was you know I was going in a hurry and so the things that I was passing in the neighborhood or however I was going I wasn't really observant you know I was just kind of I was being driven and I was going in a hurry and so as I was making my turn I took a turn and it got like you know there was a lot of cars parked and or different things I was noticing but I didn't notice all of what was around me until I came to a dead end and I came to a stop and then I realized and I'm at a dead end there's no way for me to go and so then I looked over at this garage and it looked like the garage door was open it looked like mechanic tools and the guys were working on a car and there's uh jack stands another car and then I look over here and there's cars over here they're on jack stands I'm like what is going on I pulled up to a neighborhood where the guy's doing mechanic work all in the neighborhood you know so I began to back up and I was like did I just run over a drive shaft or what and now all of a sudden now I'm like man I got to get out of here this guy is going to want to work on my truck or something you know but anyway I just I started pulling out and then I started hitting hitting cars and I I was it was dark and I realized I'm bumping into this car and this is like not a full-on wreck but I mean bumping stuff and as I'm getting out I'm like I'm starting to bump a bunch of stuff and I'm just I'm starting to get alerted and all of a sudden finally when I get around I'm starting to move and then all of a sudden I realized we're living in a time where there's cameras everywhere so then this this thing started coming over me I was like wait a minute you know what I can't just leave those cars damaged like that and so I realized you know what I got to turn around and I got to go find those people and you know when I turned around and I started to face my responsibility I woke up and there was a piece over me like you wouldn't believe and you know what I feel like that's in some way the inspiration of what I'm trying to share with you when we Face the responsibilities of being a Christian of this hour I believe that you'll have a great peace over you matter of fact it was spoken over you Shalom God's peace to you and your light has come this is the greatest hour that we can rise and shine to the glory of God but we must take responsibility now in paragraph 65 . now when we find these things though when we're confronted to come into the meeting and see the power of God moving and doing things and doing Supernatural works and seeing it performed and look in the Bible and see it's the promise of this hour then when we see these things then we are confronted with the responsibility to accept it I mean for ourselves now many times now many people sympathize many people say it's right but that don't that don't make it what that ain't what you're responsible for if you're not responsible just to say that it's right now if a young man if he's looking for a wife to be married and he he stood a girl and here stood a girl that met every qualifications that he thought took to make a woman why morally she was a queen lovely and oh fine personality a real Christian something that I think he uh that I could think of like a me a good wife no matter how much I say she's perfect she's exactly right she ain't mine until I accept her and my responsibility of her being my wife and that's the same thing the message is you might say I'm right it's right this that and the other say I'm sympathizing with it I believe it's the truth but you've got to accept it and you've got to become part of you and you part of it you've got then it's yours amen you know that's a reality check for us I believe for me we got to be so identified this is mine and I like to say because I I was an employee at one time and you know when I was working as an employee a lot of times I just did what I was told and I never really considered how much waste or how many times it would have to be redone or anything but the moment you become an owner then you become more sensitive to the whole production of things you see I believe that God is saying he he wants us to come to a place where we by our own will by our own reality check of God you've placed this into my care Lord let me identify with oh I'm a Son of God you you've you've placed something within me that I can accept the responsibility and act as you would act and grow in Grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ are you willing to face the test knowing that he's with you and that is in you the scripture says greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so we don't have to worry about failure because he's already come he's already overcome for us praise God so there's nothing to fear you know the the thing is I think sometimes what what I get afraid of what we get afraid of is if I identify then I won't have any identity of my own which we hang on to we have to accept the responsibility of being called to the wedding feast isn't it wonderful to be invited and to accept the responsibility to be a part of what God's doing my and that's the way you are with Christ when you see him manifest or made real then you're a part of him I like that see when you see him manifested and real made real then you are a part of him and he is part of you and all together you're part of the message now Jonah this is skipping paragraph 70. the first part Jonah didn't want to face up the thing of going to the Gentiles he didn't want to take a cruel message over there 40 days you'll perish if you don't repent he hated to do that and he thought them Gentiles is hard telling what they'll do to me but he had to face up to it see he took an easy ship and went down to tarshish and went down in the hole of the ship and went to sleep he took the easy route oh my just think about that to know that we're living in a time and you know like like you've heard the message taught you know when the British were coming and they were invading and there was a war coming you know we're in a battle you know the devil's on every corner trying to destroy us trying to make us lukewarm you know we need to stay in Revival be red hot for the Lord take your sword and to the Battlefront and so you just think about like Paul Revere coming in warning warning you know there's warning before judgment it's our responsibility to warn those that there's an oncoming judgment for rejecting this message which is Christ the the only form of Mercy before sudden destruction in this hour now I think about I don't know if I have it right here but you know we know that thou City of Angels you know and one day you know we heard the prophecy that the ocean will weep into the desert you know when when that fracture happens and that land just bombs off you know um there's going to be a lot of a lot of lost lives you know and I got to thinking about this within that line of thinking I was I was studying the thinking man's filter and brother Branham just drops this nugget in here and he says now blind Pharisees this is in paragraph 144. he said blind Pharisees Jesus said and Jesus cried blind Pharisees the holy spirit is my in my heart Christ blind laid osia you see this is the condition of laodicea and is trying to swallow us up but now brother branham's saying blind laodicea how off would have given you a Revival but now your time has come it's too late now how you how did they laugh and make fun of the people that God sent to you but now your time has come O United States United States how God would have hovered of you as a hen would it's brewed but you would not now this voice is going from coast to coast from north south east west how God would have hovered you but you would not now the time has come nations are breaking the world's falling apart 1500 miles chunk of it three four hundred miles wide will sink hundreds maybe 40 miles down into the great fall out yonder one of these days and waves will shoot Plum up to the state of Kentucky when it does it'll shake the world so hard until everything on top of it will shake down you know there's a shaking coming that anything that the only thing that can stand is the word of God and so everything that's gonna that is standing this is a sobriety everything's gonna fall you know when the Great Earthquake and it was dark the world was dark when he was on Calvary and they they realized that this is the Son of God but it was too late you see we've been given a commission a responsibility to go Tell The World God has come he's come in this hour and there's Mercy for you but don't wait don't wait another day don't wait another hour don't get caught up in your job don't get caught up in your school don't get caught up in your problems our Gods greater than all of that and he's worth giving all he's he's worthy to serve now is your life worthy to surrender all to forget about yesterday just turn smooth clean to him and say God all of that it's in the past I'm starting right now driving the stake down Lord will you take me and teach me my responsibility that I'll live from this day forward serving you according to your word and my responsibility you know that's a great sub Marine quote to think that we've been revealed a truth of something a future event we have the responsibility of believing that's true and adjusting Our Lives accordingly God I need to be more willing to give you all you know sometimes it's just God's asking are you willing that man that he said about his boss he said I want that I want what you got he said well you can't get it here you got to go over there to the pig pen sometimes we're just unwilling to give it the way God wants it but amen you got the potential and that's why we go through these trials that's why we go through these testings because God's proving that you're a son and you're a daughter don't look to your failures of yesterday look to the promise God you're my help God you're my provider you're my need meter you said you would lead me and guide me and I believe it and now I'm under expectation Lord I'm letting go of all the Fetters the scripture admonishes us lay aside every weight and sin that doth so easily beset us that we might run this race with patience looking to the author and finisher of our faith amen praise God what a responsibility you know I just think about this and this probably we can invite the musicians to come I just figured I'd share this last bit about you know there's examples in the word of God that we can take courage like in in the greatest battle there was a Peter Cartwright and this is uh an example of you know God giving a man a responsibility in him fulfilling it and I believe this is an encouragement to us he says well brother and this is um I don't have the paragraph number well brother if you're a soldier stand there there's a battle on right and wrong is engaged let's fight oh my who wants to fight against wrong because you know we see the results of wrong in our lives there's people that are sick you know someone can come with the wrong attitude and cause somebody not to receive their healing God examine me search my heart oh God see if there be any wicked way in me amen are we are we getting serious the hour is late my brothers and sisters God has cleansed us so that he can use us to move forward to carry out our responsibility amen he's empowered us with all of his blessings my my like Peter Cartwright he went into the City and said Lord told me to come in here and have a Revival and and he rented an old store room and got in there and began to clean it up I believe God's giving us he wants us to have a Revival and he wants us to do some cleaning up you know but there's a bully in town you name your bully you can have no Revival here you ain't gonna be no Revival there you lying devil and he shows his pistol see I got Authority I can take your life and he walked down and those doors and someone said what's that guy doing down here said he's a preacher he's going to have a meeting he said well he said I guess I just have to go down there and throw him out in the street and run him out of here that's all we don't have no meetings around in our place so he does he goes down there and he's and he stops at the door and Peter Cartwright has his coat on and you know he was just washing windows and walls down and little bitty fella you know the preacher laughed the preachers laughed at you know for eating chicken with his hands which is etiquette today you know so he was just washing windows fixing around we're getting orders for our responsibility we're going to be washing with Windows and fixing things out getting right with God and pulling out the bleach of the blood and and confess our faults one to another because he's faithful amen and so as he's doing this the big bully walked over and pulled his his coat back and showed his pistol hanging on the side of what you doing you know the Devil he's got to say his bluff you know he's got to have his voice because you got to be tested to take God at his word and look at that Peter Cartwright he says oh I'm just washing windows I'm just doing what God's leading me to do he says he just kept on washing windows you know I got one purpose God told me to hold a Revival and washing the windows down he said we don't allow revivals around here he said oh oh but God told me to to hold this revival there's no there's no question I'm sure of God you know I'm not ashamed of this gospel I'm sure God told me I would have a Revival that what is wrong the the bad place in Me God is going to cleanse and I'm going to be set free amen he says now keep he just kept working on right see and there's one thing that you have you have to understand I run this town around here he said oh you do he said and he's just keeping washing the windows you know and before you have a Revival you'll have to whoop me first he said oh I do well I'll just do that next then he took off his jacket and went down and reached to him by reached by the collar and knocked him down on the floor and started jumping on top of and he said if I must fight if I must Reign increase my courage Lord and He pounded the tar out of him and he said you got enough he said yes he got up and shook his hand and got saved that night in church there you are just take the word of God and cut your way through every doubt you see it sure that's it and the next in the next job let's get it done right the next thing to do is get away from your doubts cut it down the next thing you do is get away from all your frustrations away cut the sin my senses tell me well I feel bad the next thing to do is cut it away that's right you say well you I tell you you know my conscience tells me brother Branham that I can well you might as well cut that away that ain't gonna go no further than that just get your next job done take off your coat the barrel right into it and Barrel right into it just keep going on one objective I'm gonna win amen I can't lose I'm going to win amen isn't that your attitude you know God he paid the price that you can be cleansed of all sin amen and now this word has come to empower us to have power over the influence of the devil and the results of sin in our lives and now we can let it just come and we can come subject to it and see our responsibility is to go into all the world and they would stand I would just ask you if the Lord's put something on your heart and I don't know your world but the Lord knows and if he's making known something in your heart and you just want to rededicate your life and and you want to call the devil out and you want to take your responsibility [Music] I want to invite you to do that tonight you know it's it's like I said I've never experienced such a peace when I was willing to turn around and face the responsibility I was willing to admit that I had made a mistake I was willing to say that I didn't apply the word like I ought to you know it takes courage and I believe that if if you'll take courage tonight whatever the Lord's leading you to do I say do it let us by our hearts today precious Lord Jesus Lord in this Sovereign moment Lord Jesus we Just Want to Thank You Lord For Your goodness to to us Lord not to leave us without a witness Lord but you sent a true witness Lord that not only did he preach what he believed and you Vindicated it but oh God his life was a life that was worthy of the gospel and Lord in our heart Lord we see that we've come short in in ways Lord where

just walk around oh I have so much and when when you are given responsibility you are given power with it to bring it to an achievement you cannot be given responsibility without power otherwise you won't be able to do anything I'm responsible for what but when you are given responsibility God makes sure that he puts you in the position where something could be achieved it's our responsibility to come to God and say God we want to see this happen and we call upon you and we do this and he through that brings this word to come to pass so we can so we could see it in our lives amen we that we could be like Peter cochright you know just those people this just wants to see I'm not going to worry about what's what's going to come far away I'm worried about the next step I'm worried about what I have to do next I'm worried about and through that God himself orchestrates everything so he can come to pass amen are we thankful for that and we think with the word that we have received at the end time what a responsibility amen that we may go in all the world that we may preach the gospel and see the word and he himself come behind that word and fulfill it amen let's just Spar heads our
