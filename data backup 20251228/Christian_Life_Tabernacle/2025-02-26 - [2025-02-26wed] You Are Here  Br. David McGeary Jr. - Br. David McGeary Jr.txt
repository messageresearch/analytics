Adoration Lord that we've been able to gather together as a congregation father and to bring our burdens to bring our wants before you Lord and know that you search the hearts you are the one who's walking the aisles and Lord we're giving you the preeminence now we surrender ourselves father ourselves as a man we can not meet the needs of your people Lord and though we would even desire to do so father our efforts will fail but Lord your word has never failed and Lord one word spoken and season and anointed father could be the Deliverance could be the healing could be the peace could be the Comfort father Your Truth sets free Lord so we're surrendering ourselves to you asking Lord that just any hindrance father we bind it in the mighty name of Jesus Jesus Christ we commit it to you in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray amen if you would take your Bibles and turn with me to First John going to take a thought and uh what we been on our heart in the sermon that we uh were inspired to go to draw our inspiration from is the presence of God unrecognized and uh it the as you're turning there what I would my challenge to you would be is is that um put yourself on the right side of the word as the word would come the same word that blinds the eyes of some opens the eyes of others and we want to find the way the word is identifying us as Believers and and take it in the positive in first John it says that which from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled of the word of life for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness and show unto you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested unto us we ask the Lord just bless his word you may be seated the so appreciated the prayers and just in the opening of the service and the testimonies and I just uh gave me encouragement what I what I feel is uh a cause and effect of you having a personal identity with Christ with the word that you could testify that my eyes have seen my hands have handled is that that is the faith to Faith that is at work within the body so We've Come Together as Believers and we there should be a confidence that in the effect of each one bringing their lick of fire and bringing their faith and coming into the house of the Lord that here great things can happen it's in the congregation of the Saints and the congregation of the Believers where Miracles take place and it's because your hearing and the faith of God that is within you is the strong hands that handle the word of God you take a sword you take a weapon you put it in the hands of the unskilled they can't do anything with it but you take the word of God you put it in a Believer who's been given the faith to believe with and great things can be accomplished okay so when we come our expectation that we're coming we're encouraged to see each one that's gathered themselves into the house of the Lord and even to the effect that as we as We Gather there's if you're Discerning the needs within the body body there's going to be something maybe a burden maybe a need you enter into prayer but this is a House of Prayer so when you come you're coming with a mind that is seeking to understand what the needs are in the body and and you're wanting to enter into a mindset where you can start to pull and ask that the word of God would come and meet the needs within the body now all of that is all effectual because you are believers okay if if there's a an atmosphere of doubt in an atmosphere of unbelief then you know we even see the example within Jesus Christ himself things could not uh be done or he was with without honor in his own Hometown and we don't want to we don't want our church to become so common to us that when Jesus Christ is present we can't welcome him in to do the things he wants to do we shouldn't have to go somewhere else to get out of town so that God could have his way and and if it if that's that is now he's the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't changed he he's he's the he's the same loving savior that would sit there with je with dirty feet and and and will allow his feet to be washed with tears and and if that's your approach if that's the way you want to seek him he's there what often we fail to do is get ourselves in the right desperation and the right mindset to recognize really what's at stake and what can be gained and the opportunity that's present is that we're in the presence of almighty God and and we don't just base that as some would on an anointing on an outward uh manifestation but we have a thus sayith the Lord declaration that he's here it's so beyond I any other fallacy that man would rest in that's temporal but we know he's here because his word has been made manifest to us in this day now if you would say uh I how do how do we so Faith cometh by hearing hearing by the word of God when you testify to what God's done for you that puts Something In Motion within the body as the joint each joint to the other supplies the needs of the other there should be a testimony when you come into the house of God there should be a testimony on your lips uh in your heart in the atmosphere and in the expectation that you have even if it's not spoken there is a testimony that you are carrying into the house of God it's going to be evident upon your face it's going to be evident upon your heart it's going to be evident upon the way you start to enter into the service into the mind that you have that's your testimony it's May could may be a testimony of I didn't come expecting much I it could be testimony of uh I'm tired I'm hurt I'm distracted but you're here okay but you're here and and that if that's the title if I was to give it one is you're here all right so you if we could just recognize where we're at and and and not only just now and in this moment and the opportunity that's present to you but I believe that in this age a prophet came and he told us exactly where we're at I we can stand with the confidence knowing where we are at so when he describes things that says it ought to be it ought to be it ought to be we're not taking that as condemnation and saying oh it's not it is we're here because in his presence all things are possible it ought to be that when we come together as a a body of Believers that the sick are healed the blinded eyes are open and it is because we're here because he's present and and and and as I said at the start of the service we're approaching this as Believers so where there's two or three and if I could get one other believer two can put 10,000 to fight if one other believer came with a desperation that's a you I didn't just come to have church I didn't come to be an obligation but I need a living God amen that's right a God that changes the scene you know it it it's everything testifies to the contrary the foolishness of preaching is absolutely amazing it's absolutely amazing but it's in that that God will push an atmosphere it will drive the enemy out and you sit with a perfect opportunity to take God at his word yes Hallelujah and that's because he does it that way he chose to do it that way he chose the things that are foolishness to confound the wise because I could because really in all reality you could take this academically AI is amazing now you could uh you could go get a sermon better than I could preach you one you could go Google it up ask your topic it it and it just it's going to be a stillborn baby it's going to be academic but there's an anointing that comes on the word of God because we're the children of God okay and the seed can't bite alone you as a Son of God holding on to the word of God cannot not be anointed I don't know if the double negative work there or not but it's he abides and Broods out over his word so if you want to even if you don't feel them and if you don't know him to be present if the word is there he's there because just like there was seeds that were in the earth sewn in the earth and were present he said that just as he he he deals with the individual the same way he dealt with the Earth he said the Holy Spirit brooded out over the Earth to bring to life the seeds that were already there so if the seed is there the holy spirit's job is to brood out over the word and bring it to maturity amen so I if if you want to see an effect uh take God at his word and whether you recognize him in a in in some uh Earthly manifestation he's there working now um I don't know how we're going to minister this you just pray for me and ask the Lord to be faithful to walk us through this but um one of the things that you have to recognize is just like the woman that would have the blood issue there had to be a challenge or a predicament or a place of desperation that would put her in a place for her to take advantage of the presence of God so we often times will take it the very evidence that God can do something is the very thing that the devil is trying to use to tell you that you're hopeless it's to it's to tell you that it's not possible and when you start recognizing that that is the very thing that the presence of God comes to address then you start to recognize all things are possible so whatever it is in your life that you have that you think is impossible that you think is ridiculous our God is the god of the impossible we we're not we're not here merely to accomplish the things that man could accomplish I'm sure that some some of you could leave here and turn a new Leaf you could have a new uh determination to do better and you may even be able to accomplish those things out of a discipline for a season um I've my life and my testimony I'm I I could go back through the track record it's full of those failures there's the David McGary tried David McGary got jailhouse religion David McGary did a lot of things but then Jesus came and then all those things that I did after the natural he did supernaturally so we're not testifying to a god that just does things that man can do and God helps those who can help themselves and you just need to yield Your Vessel uh in a way that really is just you making more effort but we're saying let God come and change the very fabric of your life and if and that's the desperation that I believe is present in God's children yes sir that's the that is in this sermon if you would go and I you could find it when you get someone's heart that is desperate for God there is nothing that's going to stop it nothing it it you could you could try to point to the Creed and say well it's not that way you God doesn't do it that way you're you're you could you could be challenged with well you're going to be put out of Fellowship you know brother brandom goes through and he starts saying these are all the religious spirits that she's pressing through to get to Jesus Christ but because her heart was convinced that in his presence there was an answer Hallelujah nothing could stop it and that's faith and that faith comes by testimony when you take a look at the at the Queen of Sheba she's down south she's I believe three months away and they don't have radio and they don't have television so I got to tell you there's a testimony we're going to hear when we get over Yonder of somebody some somebody was on the road test Tes ifying of to the things that were being done in the house of God in Solomon's Temple there's a wisdom that's beyond the wisdom of man and there's got to be somebody who has on their lips and in their life in my life I've seen him he he's changed the scene I was sick I'm Healed I I woke up this morning I didn't think I could have enough strength to get out of bed my my spirit was from me I was depressed ressed but I just committed myself to God and he gave me the strength as I was talking and meditating someone called and gave me a scripture it was the very scripture I was thinking on he does little things to assure you that he's with you and he's doing it all the time all the time and that's got to provoke such a love in your life for him that you're no longer going to stay and hold it and B bottle it all in but you're going to cause a Queen of Sheba testimony you're going to start going on the road and say the things which we've heard and then that you got to recognize The Thirst that that provokes now where you're at may be on the road you may have heard the testimony and it could be I'm desperate I've heard that he changes hearts and he changes minds and he takes your old desires and makes some new desires you could be hungering and thirsting for a new birth experience and it's it's real and it's for you and you're here he's here to give it to you and 1 John 3:20 says he is greater than our hearts and knoweth all things so he's he's he's the he is the high priest he is the one who knows what's on your heart and because he knew it you know we've got a we've got the opportunity in this day to really understand the mind of God you know that's what one of the things Satan really hates is that we boast in knowing the very heartbeat intent of God that before the foundation of the world the lamb was slain and that he had already made provision to manifest his attributes to you but in order to manifest those attributes the desperation had to come you had to be sick that you could be healed our pastor tells the testimony of wanting to experience God as a Healer and not realizing and thinking that thought process through that he would have to have something wrong that needed to be healed he had a board come up rip his arm break his thumb it was it was mangled and it was in a service where he started to raise his hands and praise the Lord and he recognized he had been healed and when you may not even be uh aware that he's already moving to meet the need but that's he knew you you know he's a father a sister sent a song to me I listen to it and I one of the lyrics I got I I thought it said uh do you know my dad and that inspired me I was like do you know my dad that's right well it was saying do you know my God and I got it wrong but the confidence we should have and the boldness we should have is one where we should be able to think what a father is to us true okay and a father knows what you have need of before you even ask for it he's already sees the need in your life he already knows what you don't know you need and he is going to do what he needs to do to minister to the need as a father would do it we had a a brother visiting us a brother Aaron Palmer and he has some young children and me and Julia were enjoying them and we're just spoiling them rotten and as you spoil a kid they typically you know end up wanting their way you know so then when they get told to do something it's like but don't I get what I want and uh brother Aaron said something to the effect of you know you you're not making a good parent you know and it and it and it just it it struck me because there's a lesson in that as a father and with a Father's Eyes the love that he has for us is one that he's interested in your character true he's interested in the final result and if something just becomes easy and it's just microwave religion then it's not getting the result that he's after and and what what you have to realize is he'll purchase the field to get the treasure in the field so he'll he'll send out a a a blessing and and bless everyone just to bless you he'll buy everybody in the family A gift to get you the gift okay fathers hide favorites all right so it there's going to be what God does and he's that way he he absolutely does things that really all he really cares about is that he got it for you and when and when we talk about the blessings of God it it you got to recognize that their rock is not our Rock okay where we have placed our confidence in is not where other people have placed their confidence in so when the blessings of God come we want to take those in Channel them right back into the word of God knowing that Lord I want this to accomplish what you desire for it to accomplish in me so there's a there is a and that is not we I say that to people who that is their heart's desire I believe that absolutely but you you can't let the counterfeit or the Scarecrow that Ma that uh cause you to think that that's the final result yeah exactly because the final result there there is one where they're blessed in the house of God today and they're in the bar on Monday come on and and if God's going to have take a a joy and a pride in anybody it's going to be his children but the blessing is also ours amen um the uh and what I what I want you to understand is is uh he loves you enough to put you in a pinch okay he loves you enough to put you in a place where he can show His blessings and you wouldn't if you could know the end of the story um it should give you a peace and and uh I you know what let's let's just take a look at Revelations 19:7 Revelations 197 would say let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself self ready so the hour and where we're at is here this is the hour that we're in we're not in another age we're not in another day we're not in a waiting but the lamb has been declared present here with us the bridegroom is here taking a bride now what is the disposition of the Bride let us be sad and for longing and not praise him because we've got to do a lot of work because weddings are a lot of work work till Jesus comes we're going to work but there's a joy that is in the the hearts of the believer at is appearing and that it the devil wants to take your joy when you recognize you have an enemy when you recognize he hates the continence of the Holy Ghost on your life he doesn't want to see a believer that has the joy of the Lord in their life and he's going to try to rob it from you you have to withstand the enemy recognize his tricks and say you're exposed I cannot be sad when the when the lamb is with me if I have the bridegroom how could I be sad I have a right to call those things that are as those they are not I am not living for this life I'm not living for this world and I have a more sure promise than anything this world could offer me and so the this world can't take that Joy no it it can't and it it's it's uh the peace of God is really astounding and it just as a way of testimony as a young believer I remember sitting in a room with a bunch of people getting laid off in the groups of 30s it was 30 people sitting in a room and I'm just giddy yeah I'm smiling and I I wasn't trying to be disrespectful I really wasn't it was my genuine continence and it was because I was amazed that God was going to do something that was better than where I was at I recognized good and it wasn't that wasn't me I knew where I was standing yeah come on I knew where I was at I was a Son of God I wasn't worried about tomorrow I knew who held it and you're in his hand you have to look and say I'm here are you out of his hand you're in his hand I'm here I'm breathing is is my heart beaten I'm here and you're in the presence of God you're in the presence of almighty God all things are possible and it is when we come to the recognition of his presence that our faith is the highest okay he's no less God but when we come to a recognition of his presence our faith Rises because it we have such a confidence in his love for us that when you're in his presence you know all things are just fine you're under the wings of the eagle so what we what the it's a formula you want your faith to rise pray through until you're in his presence till you're aware of his presence because in that atmosphere you can ask in faith you can ask believing and what we would do better in all all of our Lives is to do the things that so our hearts doesn't condemn us so we can stay more aware that his presence is Abiding and Bre in out over you you know he's there if our eyes would be opened we would see the Angels encamped about those who fear Him right there would be a there would be a boldness that we could have if our eyes became opened into the spiritual but without faith it's impossible to please God so God didn't do this in such a way that he doesn't get any pleasure in it that you would just see the the handwriting on the wall and you would know thus sayith the Lord this is empirical evidence can you guys see that I see that it says uh you know go get a wife and her name is and it's and it's written on the wall and now I no longer need faith I no longer now to know that he knows my heart's desires and he knows what I have need of and he knows and cares I'm just going to take a dead approach to God's will in my life but no he takes his word and he and he speaks it to you and there's a there's something in your heart that says I believe that that's the truth I see that and it and then we don't want to just leave it as a recognized word we want to take it and possess it we want to make it our own you know it it wouldn't be uh you know uh Moses saying that is a burning bush and just acknowledging it but there comes a point where you have to come in the presence of the very thing that you're acknowledging that's the difference right is it's not just that we've seen but our hands have handled there there has to be just in the Old Testament when you look at the the lamb and the and the sacrifice there was no way for the believer not to become intimate with the sacrifice if it was a bloody mess and it and there and it was an impression that would be left upon the believer and understanding that this animal has laid its life down for me and there is an effect of coming in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ where there's a complete recognition of his love for you and what he accomplished at Calvary and otherwise what you've come in contact with is just a general outpouring and an anointing and it's there but when you come in contact with the Sovereign presence of God there is no other way to feel but guilty and humble that's right and you're thankful that he loves you and the blood was shed for you because it's the same Grace that teaches the Heart To Fear the same Grace the fears relieved and there it it's a it's a miraculous thing that the holy presence of An Almighty God would come amongst the people and when he does all things are possible and what we want to be testifying in our lives is that he's here that he's present and I know it I mean the uh the effect of that is life to those around you it's that is the that is the word of life you know when you when you when we talk about the word of life it was a testimony that was going to the Queen of Sheba and that was the word of God to her a testimony of the things that were being done was the word of God because it was it being spoken out through a lived out life and you are Epistles read of all men so I I if I just to bring it home your life is the very presence of God that's deity dwelling in flesh and you should be in expectation of great things and and it's it's it's that leap and that action of faith and having a confidence in what the word of God has said about you and I trust that we know these things what the word of God has told us we ought to be and and not only in our conduct in a Sanctified life we could go down the line and we can preach these things not ought to be there and we could we could say yes Lord I'm taking you at your word do a cleansing work cut this from my life but I'm also talking about for the faith and believing for others for the our lost loved ones for the healing that needs to be manifested in our body you know there's there's physical needs there's healing that needs to be uh provided and it could be your testimony of what God's done for you that causes the faith to rise up in someone else and say absolutely I believe it if you did it for them you could do it for me it's the Hatty right it's the it's that opportunity when the presence of the Lord comes in on just the a spoken testimony that great things can transpire and and we see that I anytime Believers come together that the the body ministers to the needs that are present he dwells in his word and his words and his word comes into your heart and speaks it self out and declare he interprets his own word through you he's trying to find somebody he can get a hold of to show that he is still God he is he will do that if he can just get somebody he can speak to if he can get another woman with a blood issue he can still speak the same thing he can still do the same thing making known declaring were in the presence of God and it we don't want to sometimes be the one that has the burden but she was put into motion she had heard a testimony of a woman whose sins had been forgiven her and she knew that if she could get to the the man who did that for her then she could be touched also and we it we don't have another way Saints he's either alive and living in the body doing things in our lives declaring himself the resurrected life because it it when we come when I I could stand here and I could tell this in the way of the testimony of the things the Lord's done in my life to make himself real but what we want is not that your confidence would rest in the in that that he's done it just solely in someone's life but his word has promised this for you the believer that it is for you and that it is yours to possess and that it and that his word is life and and this is if we would just continue in John as we would as we read that which which that which we've seen and heard and declared we unto you that would that ye also may have fellowship with us and truly our fellowship is with the father and with his son Jesus Christ and these things write we unto you that your joy may be full this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves now that seems like a conundrum don't it and the truth is not in us if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us oh the cleansing power of Christ it it is the very recognition that we're Sinners is that it's the grace of God manifested to us Jesus did not come to save The Righteous he didn't come to to heal those who had no need of a physician but he came to those who have a heart that you know what is it if if I was to say and and I'm declaring to you that Jesus Christ is here and you could have whatever you have need of I would hope that we wouldn't draw a blank right and not be able to ask for anything if if if we have have have sought out the needs within the body so much that when the opportunity to ask anything that you have need of is presented to you and you go I don't know yeah it I mean that's dumb driven cattle right that's that's being dull that's being numb but when he when you have the opportunity to ask for anything that you have need of yes sir and you're in the presence of God and all things are possible there becomes a personal possession that you have a faith to the the the ticket comes together he's my father I have confidence that if I ask him he'll provide all the things that I have need of Lord my brother he has need of you that's the faith that's the atmosphere that's what that's why we assemble ourselves together that's the dynamic and that's the pool and he's faithful and we cannot leave without having our needs met he he wants to bless us more than we even recognize there's no father that would give his son a stone when he asked for a piece of bread he he's just not going to do it what we have to do is approach him as our father we have to recognize who we are we have to reckon ourselves Sons and Daughters of God and and and take possession and and and say Boo devil I am not identified as a son of of of this world and a and a child of darkness and everything that you would try to put a worldly identity on me as I'm identified as a son of God there's a uh there's an accuser of the Brethren is what I what I try to express and that voice is a real voice but everything that he can accuse you of the only thing that he really can condemn is this flesh because your identity in Christ and your soul and the C Gene of God never send in the first place the recognition of what true justification is in this day should set our Hearts free and it does set our hearts free from all condemnation the only thing we have to do is renew our minds by the washing of the water of the word and and recognize our position God you see me sinless and spotless when I ask you it is your heart's desire to give me the petitions of my heart because I'm not asking a miss you know so many times we take it and I I I judg myself like okay that's not my thought I wouldn't pray this after the flesh sometimes we have to be honest with ourselves and what Scoundrels we really are it was my sins that held him there it was my mocking voice we have to recognize the flesh is an enemy okay and in recognizing that guy doesn't say good things have confidence of the voice of God in you have conf confidence of the deity that's wanting to speak out step out in faith and say it take God at his word that's not you speaking that's Christ the anointed word speaking in you that's a boldness that's ours to possess it's mine I'm taking back what the devil took from me it's recognizing the presence of Jesus Christ is alive in you to do and to perform the very things that he promised to do as an individual I claim if brother Brandon towards the end of the service he's talking about those who I may be Sinners seeking an experience but I find this may be more uh applicable to us as he as he uh offers those who do not know them does know him who's heard his word and would like to uh raise their hands he moves in and he says this in 205 he says I claim every one of them maybe some Christians Lord that's trying to walk through life trying to live better every day and they want an experience of a better walk they raised their hands too father I pray that you will bless them may they find that all sufficiency tonight in Christ the word made flesh amongst us Grant it Lord I commit them thee in thy name in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen in the sermon brother Brandon would go through he would show the sign that was given to Abraham he would make manifest the son of man Ministry in his life Jesus Christ declaring his presence amongst us if we were just left with thinking that was something that was only done historically in time it would be stuck in a book and none of us would be able to say that we were there I don't think any you know very few would be old enough to have been there and if so would probably been a child and we would have missed the opportunity to say that we had been in the presence of God made known and declared so sovereignly so directly and the way God does it now is no different because the word is still Discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart and there's a effect when the word of God comes in my life and shows me the things that have to be cut away that I recognize he's never left me he's never forsaken me and that's why his word Cuts that's why it's still dividing and no bastard child with they don't withstand correction but lord it's because I'm recognizing that I have need of you it's because I recognize that I need you that's what the greatest confidence I have that you're still wanting to deal with me and change my life if if it the the condition of a blind wretched naked and miserable and when I was talking about the presence of God being recog not being recognized or if he was here and you could ask it's that condition that you wouldn't be able to ask anything would be your wretched blind miserable poor wretched and naked have need of nothing and don't know it I'm good you're here but I'm good I don't I don't need you to minister to the things in my life that are dirty I don't need you to take away the things that I cannot uh deal with myself I'm I've got this and it's not an I got this he's got this we ain't got this I don't know if anybody of you needs your confidence shaken in yourself but we ain't got this we don't have a chance if you're left to yourself you will fail I need a savior I need a present help I need a God that's alive I need one that delivers me I need him to come and apprehend my very thoughts my very Minds my very voice I need Jesus Christ put on display I need him to be life to those who are in desperation we can't we we're past being able to rest in the things that we can do they'll be temporal it's okay to do that them but we've got to be have enough wisdom and enough foresight to say Lord I've handled this but I need you now I remember a testimony of a L young lady I I coming from my side it was no surprise that when you really mess your life up that you want God I mean that wasn't a surprise but what I could not understand was the desperation that could happen when someone's just got it all together you're good how can you come to a place of desperation it was a mystery to me not a mystery that I could mess my life up not a mystery that I was a loser I really didn't have a life to live and I needed God I was dead but how could someone who seemingly gets good grades obeys their parents does the things that they are told to do come to a place of desperation where they recognize I can't do this and I got to hear a testimony of somebody said I'd always obeyed my parents I'd always done what was right I was raised right but I knew I was leaving home and I was going to be away from all of it and something struck me I don't have what it takes to keep me I ain't got this and a desperation set in God I need you I don't want to live without you I need you present now and the same Grace that could take a sinner and convert him could take a good person and recognize Lord I need you I can't live without you the same Grace that kept them from having to go in the world was the same Grace that gave them experience to know that he would never leave him or forsake Him and that wherever you're at he's here the the the place you are at when you look I was out on a ship and I didn't know I found myself quite turned around quite a bit and if I was going to go anywhere or do anything I had to go to the map and I had to look at it and it had to tell me I am here and if I was going to go get food I needed to know if I was supposed to go up the stairs or go down the stairs because I was tired of going up and down the stairs not knowing where I was going I finally decided I would go look at the map and if you want to know where you're at we have a map you cannot put on a tape and listen to the voice of God to this generation and not identify exactly where you're at you cannot come to the house of God with an expectation and not have the word of God come and speak to your need and tell you exactly where you're at I believe that if the musicians would come you know I believe the only thing we really sometimes have to do is literally say I'm here Lord we just have to identify I'm here right where you're at it doesn't matter matter the place he's omnipresent there is not a place in your mind and and and I'll give charge to the devil right now there a there is not a place in your mind that God can't come get you out of if he could if he could call a Lazareth forth I rebuke any devil that thinks he could take somebody into some fantasy land think that he can occupy their mind in such a way that the almighty presence of God cannot become aware to them I'm S I got a testimony sitting right here of somebody who is under the influence of other things and a voice shouted out and said that's the last time I don't care where you're at all you have to do is say Lord I'm here Here I Am Lord it could be Tanger in a a Brier he's the Good Shepherd that will leave the 99 and he'll go exactly to right where you're at all you have to do is say Lord I've looked in your word I see the map I'm here I need you Lord I'm confused I need Revelation amen I Lord I I got to tell you I don't even know what my next step is but I'm here you're the one who could turn on your words a light into my path I'm here Lord invite him to come become aware of his presence to you and you and you will never be the same yes let's just stand together [Music] just forgive me and so much I wanted to read if you can go listen read the book from our Prophet I believe it would really uh minister to you let's just bow our hearts Heavenly Father we thank you that you're here yes Lord Lord that in the things that we cannot do ourselves or accomplish you can do Lord and that is truly all we can say father is we need you regardless of where we're at father our next step we can't take it without you lord if we've served you for 40 years we still need you Lord if we're just coming to know you we need you Lord and you're the only one who knows exactly where we're at father you know each one that's in this room where their thoughts are at this very Mo moment Lord in my prayer and my desire Lord I believe even what you desire and put on my heart is that we would recognize your presence Lord that you're here to do what we cannot do that you're here to minister to the needs that we have Lord and that you so loved us that you purchased it all father Calvary declared that it is finished all we have need of for healing you've already suffered the stripes Lord we ask that our faith would grow and even seeing our brothers and sisters gathered together here we have a word that says where two or three are gathered you're present with us Lord just that scripture alone should give us enough Faith to know that all things are possible Lord I ask that each one as we would raise our hands and say Lord Here I Am Lord I remember a weak prayer I said one time I said behold me oh the answer was on the way father you seen me Lord You've Changed me you're the same yesterday today and forever father I ask that those who've raised their hands may they know that you've seen them Lord they could not raise their hand and you not see them so we know that all things are possible and the answer is on the way for we've asked these things in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen I wanted to sing that song actually that's in my notes [Music] put that I don't think anybody else could see

that that presence of God and by the promise Lord I heard your Prophet say the other day speaking about speaking about Joshua he said that Joshua received the promise from God and and Joshua took the word of God and he said and he took the word of God and whatever he spoke he laid it upon That Word of Promise because he knew if God promised that it would come to pass Lord our brother did the same he spoke the word and and whatever we have need of Lord we are placing in upon the Word of Promise Lord because we know you have already spoken and if we can just lay our needs our our desires our trials everything that we go through upon on that that same word it will produce the same result every time lord like he said even that woman with a blood issue oh Lord we are that woman with a blood issue tonight we talked about the Blind Men We Are that blind man tonight and we take our trials and our our difficulties and we place it upon that same word that same promise that will produce the same result father I pray that there be no feeble person Among Us tonight that each one in this building others are listening to they may receive something from you Lord that could have an eternal testimony about your presence and what you can do we love you with all our hearts Lord your word just brings joy to our hearts satisfaction father it quenches The Thirst inside and there's nothing like it and we ask for those that have been prayed for Lord father May the Holy Spirit as our brother spoke the holy spirit is the one that Broods upon the word father may he go after what they have spoken and what's been prayed upon and brooded until it comes to the reality to those that have requested it Lord because I believe that's your promise to the believer we commit everything to you Lord and we ask that as we depart from this place may you just protect us along the way Lord and if you be your will that we meet again may you may we come with the same expectation for the same Living God knowing that you haven't changed you're the same yesterday today and forever that you will do again father your Prophet said that you want to bless us so much father that if we will take all the Waters of the world and combine it in one pipe and pump it it will still not be enough as much as you want to bless us I pray that Lord for all the challenges we Face we may remember that there's a presence somewhere that we can get into that all things will be made possible in the presence of the Living God we love you Lord and we remember our pastor once again and sister Leslie and those that
