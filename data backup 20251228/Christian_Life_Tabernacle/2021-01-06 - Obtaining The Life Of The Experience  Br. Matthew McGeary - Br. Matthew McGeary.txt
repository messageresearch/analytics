lord jesus i believe that every son and daughter would agree that they want you to have your perfect will and way in their life lord truly lord as we live here on this earth and we are in these tabernacles of clay we have desires and wants and certainly see the natural needs of a home and shelter and cars and vehicles and careers and jobs and providing for our families and lord many times we form plans and ideas and look to the ways that we would accomplish those things but lord we know that it's not in ourselves to provide those things but it's in you lord you said seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you and lord however you would see fit to provide for us lord we want what you want lord many times it's hard to die out to our ideas it's hard to die out to our wants our dreams our goals our ambitions lord but you know what's best for us lord we've come to the house of god that we could just surrender to your will lord we've sung the songs of zion we've lifted up your name and we thank you for your presence by divine promise that is here and now lord we look that you would come and you'd break the bread of life as only you can lord i am needy of you to come by and just use the vessel lord and ourselves we don't have anything to give but lord if by your holy spirit you could come and just speak lord that the hungry hearts that have gathered can hear from you not hearing from a man but here from your throne tonight we pray we love you lord we commit the service we surrender ourselves to you now in jesus christ's name we pray amen praise the lord it's good to be in the presence of god i mean if you have your bibles we'll just read a couple scriptures we'll read revelations chapter one now we just want to remember our pastor and prayers he's not feeling well i he he wanted to be in the house of god so he is here in the back but he's just battling some pain and some some affliction in the flesh so just remember him tonight reading revelations chapter 1 verse 17 and 18 says and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and have the keys of hell and of death amen you may be seated this has a blessing on the reading of the word as you turn also to romans chapter 8. just read from by this it's so wonderful here we'll just start with verse one and work to verse 11. it says there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit i love that has anybody ever battled condemnation i don't know about you but condemnation is a very serious tactic of the enemy and when he starts heaping on the condemnation and starts pointing to your past or to your mistakes or to your failures and he he gets you to start looking at how things could have been or should have been and how maybe you should have handled something starts making you kind of feel a little down kind of makes you start feeling a little out and then when we start looking into the word and my how we how we love to feed on the word and we we see the examples that god's put before us and and why we're feeding on the word and then also it just seems like you can be rejoicing and looking at these great promises and then something kind of just slip in and say yeah but you ain't anywhere near there you know and yeah you just don't add up and all of a sudden condemnation can come in and and really start to have an effect on you where you you don't want to make that phone call or you don't want to go to the house of god or you just might not testify and you want to pray and and all of a sudden you can find yourself just really fighting a battle out of nowhere but i love the scripture right here jesus said there's no condemnation to them that are in christ jesus and even when your heart condemns you god's greater than your heart oh i love the word it just knows how to wash you don't it just knows how to take you when you're feeling all down and you're feeling all blue and you don't know what to do you can just look into the mirror of god's word you can look into his promises and he'll just take you and wrap his arms around you and tell you everything's gonna be okay amen there is therefore now no condemnation to them which on christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of the life in christ jesus hath made us free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for our sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit that's a good scripture to do a checkup on your life for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh once again if if you have a heart to serve god and you're wanting to serve god but you find that you're minding the things of the flesh and you haven't overcome certain things you know you should have well don't don't be condemned in such a way that you shrink back but know that god has shown you that there's more for you you know that should be uh something to encourage the believer is when you look into god's word and you see it calls for something and you see that you're falling short don't don't be discouraged and give up be encouraged to know that god has more for you i mean so many times the enemy wants to just turn it around on you in such a way where where it causes you to shrink back but know what god is wanting you to see is yes that's okay my son this is where you're at and you're still battling certain things in the flesh but i'm wanting you to know there's higher heights and deeper depths there's a place of deliverance there's a place of refuge that you can enter into where you're not minded the things of the flesh anymore but you've moved into a place where you find yourself not minding the things of flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit as you start to surrender your life and you come to that place of justification and sanctification and now the holy spirit is is moving in your life you find yourself to be about the father's business and even for those that have received the baptism of the holy ghost we have to remain vigilant and to bring this flesh into subjection because it's so easy to fall back or it's so easy to give in if you're not careful oh yes there was a question asked could somebody with the holy ghost you know do bad things or do very bad things look you're in a tabernacle that's unconverted this flesh if you will this flesh man oh it's it's not going to be converted uh uh you're going to leave that here we're going to shed this thing there's another tabernacle that god has prepared for us that when this earthly tabernacle dissolved all we're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of eye and we're going to be caught out of here but but we got to realize there's a white dog and a black dog and whenever that black dog if you if you if you're not bring it under subjection and you allow it to start having its own way and feeding on things you you better watch out that's where all something in our heart is born again believers filled with the holy spirit we got to bring it into subjection for to be carnally minded as death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please god but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of god dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his and if christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus christ from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen and just really appreciate the word of our pastor and brother billy on sunday we just hopefully maybe can say something just to maybe support that or fall in line but we're just thankful for the holy ghost we're thankful that there's there's something in the believer uh that cries out for more of god and cries out for that manifestation and as our pastor was speaking on stepping away out of the theology you know that's truly something that all of us should really take very seriously and and consider because it's easy for us uh to get into our routines it's easy for us to check all the boxes it's easy for us to maybe study the word and listen to the message and then we find out if we're not careful we've maybe entered into more of a a religion or a routine and maybe more into a theology and not really allowing the life of that word to be what's jurisdicting our actions which jurisdicting our day that's that's leading and guiding us on a daily basis and we find ourselves maybe uh in a rut or in a routine and just want to read this quote out of it is the rising of the sun it says now you who were once walked along with a great big cigar in your mouth and everything or a bunch of cigarettes and you women once had short hair and painted and carried on and wore shorts and things like that all at once something screamed and you looked down here and it was the word see it quickened you said no more shorts for me no more liquor for me no more lying no more stealing no more this or that i i like when the prophet says no more this or that because it just that gets it all you know you might have you might have grown up in a message home where where you know where the token has been applied or or had good parents that have have raised you really well and there hasn't been the nonsense in the home and and you might feel like uh well you know what there's i didn't have to battle all those things i've never come to a place to where i had to say no to the influence of the world but i want you to know being born in sin and shaped in iniquity there has to come a place where there that seed receives from the word and that cry in there is crying out to god there's a deep calling to a deep and something responds and you actually know that there's been a change take place you you can say oh i've been in the church pew and i i've been going through all of the motions but there comes a time where something becomes more real to you than it's ever been and we thank god for his keeping power and i believe it's an inheritance unto the believers of this day that we can raise our children in in the ammunition of the lord and and apply the token to our household and have them in a church where the the word is faithfully taught and at young ages they can come to know the lord and have an experience but i want to encourage each and every one of you to come to that place where you know that you know that you know that you come to the place where you can say no more stealing and no more this or that no more doubting no more second-guessing no more wondering what's out there in the world no more worrying about uh what what other religions or whatever doctrines or whatever things are out there because you've come to a place where you met the author of the word you've come to a place where you've met jesus christ and he meets every single deed that you've ever had and it's you and him alone and nothing else matters and you can come to that place no more this or that it's you and you alone lord see that's the spirit that raised him from the dead dwelling in you will also bring your mortal bodies the dust of the earth into subjection you see what is it subjection to what christ who is christ the word not the theology but the word not a conforming not a struggle but by the power of the holy ghost you're changed you're you're receiving a nature you know you can you've heard the the the the story go like this you can take a pig and you can clean them all up what is he going to do he's going to go right back and start walling around in the mud again and look if if if you're in a in a place in your life where you find out you're struggling with something and look you can you can have a mental will or you can have a focus and there's people out in the world that they've they they give up alcohol they give up cigarettes and they come to a place of a resolve and a decision and they make good choices and then embedded their lives and they commit to fitness programs and they do a lot of things through through through being able to make a mental decision and and staying true to it and and so i say it behooves you if you find out that that you find yourself coming back around to something and something keeps peaking its head back up in your life you can come to a place of total deliverance and look that's god god allows these tests and he allows these trials to come into our lives so that you can come to that place of deliverance that's just the way it is and praise god he does it that way because it's always to show you that there's more in store for you you don't have to live that way anymore look if you're trying to conform to a set of rules and regulations and conform to to maybe what up what from that vantage point you think the message is because the message is not a religion the message is not a denomination the message isn't a group of people that have identified a set of moral codes and identified a set of teachings and they all got together and they said you know what we all agree together and this is going to be what we believe and this is our religion and this is what we're going to push and this is what we're going to set forth and we're all just trying to conform and hold some type of standard no sir the message is jesus christ and when you've met jesus christ and you've been changed you received the nature of the word and that's what this message is doing it's bringing you into the nature of jesus christ where his thoughts are your thoughts and your actions are his actions it's he and you and i and you it's it the whole thing is him and until you get to that place i invite you to come to that place oh to where you're transformed and you're changed and then those things that you've been struggling with and those things that you've been battling and those things that you have been worrying about when they all start to dissolve because you start beholding the word and you look into the word and the word speaks back and something in you says amen and it starts to transform and starts to quicken you it starts to quicken your mortal body oh you're no longer dead but you're made alive in jesus christ now you're living but if you're conforming if that struggle is still there now once again it's okay if you're struggling it's okay if you've been trying to conform if you've been making an effort that's okay if you've been making an effort to wear your clothes in a different way and wear your hair in a different way and brothers to dress not like the world and wear all the trendy things of the worlds and the pants and the shirts and the hairstyles and you're making ever but you find yourself battling oh just know that you can come to a place of total surrender to where his life comes into you and those things don't have a pull on you anymore but oh if we're not staying in the channel we're not staying feeding on the word if we're not staying in in the spirit and reading and praying then bringing this this old bag of bones into subjection becomes a little tougher and you find yourself not praying as much not reading as much and you find yourself out doing things and looking around on things that you shouldn't do and wasting your time and and the longer you do it isn't amazing how the harder it gets the longer you go without praying the harder it is to pray has anybody ever experienced that you know the longer you go without reading your bible the longer you go without getting in the presence of god well i thank god we had we had a wonderful prayer service last night really felt his presence and and uh sister julia brother cosmic labor on the piano just helped create a a wonderful atmosphere and i it was just refreshing to be in the presence of god and to hear the prayers of the saints going up and coming to his presence oh it's sometimes we we need we need those things to help break us through and enter in and you know you come home and it's just easier to enter in you you come to the church service or something like that and there's a refreshing of the spirit it's easy to enter in it's easier to get into the spirit it's easy to pick up your bible and start to read and you just feel like man it's speaking back to you but oh when we allow the cares of the world just to continue on and continue on and then we want to let off the pressure with the current events and news and certain things like that and we're not feeding our soul oh we find ourselves uh where that where where we we start to find it harder to do the things that we know to do and john 5 24 says verily verily i say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death and to life just in this message rising to the son brother branham and referring to that text he says he that heareth he says really in the greek it's he that understandeth my word he says you know not necessarily hear that heareth and he says to to show you this is the truth and he says now you could have maybe a drunk and walk down the road and he he's all has his arm around a woman he's not married to and he's cursing and all these things and say hey drunk did you hear what the preacher said he said yeah i heard it but see it didn't have any effect and he's showing that it's not it's not in just a hearing of the word naturally but there has to come an understanding there you have to come to a place to where now the word it's not just a hearing of the word only but it's a doer the life of the word is coming and making its abode it's making its resident in you and now that word that you heard is now living out through you he that understandeth my word and just in that thinking upon uh just the theology or religion and things you know it's not an understanding or a comparison or a research or committee or facts or works or something that we come to know the word of god it's not by your mind it's not by facts it's not by research you can hear it all your life you can hear it preached all your life you can read all the message you want to read but but if it's just up here you've never really come to a knowledge and understanding of the word because you have to have the life of the word it's like i was i was thinking you know one time i remember trying to tell my daughter look don't touch that it'll burn you well you can just try to describe to somebody all you want what it means to be burnt well it's like a really you know it like it hurts really bad and it's like it's like a sharp not like a sharp pain but it's a burning it's a burning well you you can try to explain it all you want but every once in a while somebody catches the revelation you tell him not to touch the hot stove you tell him not to touch the hot iron you tell him not to stick things in the in the wall socket or you'll get electrocuted well you can study electricity all you want you can study what it means to be burned but when there comes a day where all of a sudden you stick your hand in that electric socket and you get shocked i know what it means to get shocked oh glory hallelujah it's that same way when you come in contact with the resurrected lord jesus christ when it gets all the ego i've been changed i know what it means i know what it's like oh it's not up here anymore but i got a revelation and then you can go tell somebody else look don't do that you'll get shocked you get electrocuted what does that mean i said tell you and then you can start witnessing the people you say oh you don't want to live that way i used to live that way before but there's a better way you can repent you can be baptized in the name of jesus christ you can receive salvation and the gift of the holy ghost and you can receive a comforter that'll comfort you no matter what you're going through and you can speak from experience have you ever had somebody try to sell you something they haven't experienced or tell you about something they haven't experienced you go to a restaurant you try to order a meal well this is really good yeah have you had it before no i've heard it's really good it's one of our most popular things but when somebody's experienced it oh that's my favorite thing i eat in about three or four i take what you have they'll give that to me because they know what they're talking about oh hallelujah may we be a people that know what we're talking about i don't care if we come in contact with people that have their church services out there and they're running and screaming and shouting and speaking in tongues and they got all the works and they got signs and they got wonders and everything following them praise god that's what my god does i like to know when my god is blessing other people i haven't even come to the knowledge of the full truth that means it puts me in a position to say hey do you know there's something more i don't shy from it i don't back down from it i embrace it because i know the author say that's my god he's a god who heals he's a god that delivers he's a god that said i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh oh you'll dream dreams you'll prophesy you'll speak in tongues praise god that's my god he doesn't limit his his blessings to one house he's a god of mercy he's a god of compassion oh when you come to know him when you've come to experience it for yourself praise god then you know what you're talking about it's not a conforming it's not a religion it's not in your head but it's a reality because i tell you what your mind you can have stuff up here your mind will fail you and you can plug this scripture in that quote and you can listen to this message and you can hear the prophet and you get a pretty good handle of something and you have it ironed out pretty good and then you hear it this way and you hear a minister say it that way and then you realize you ain't got nothing ironed out any good you say i thought i had it down i thought i knew what the godhead was i i thought i knew what the seventh seal was i i thought i knew what the son of man was i thought the son of man said i thought i knew when the coming of the lord was i thought it was health you know what that's all you don't get caught up in theology but if you're walking with him oh like those disciples on the road to emmaus oh they were so downtrodden here they were walking along and what did jesus oh he came along he said oh fools and slow of heart to believe everything that the prophets had ever said oh they were walking with him oh they were walking with the most blessed uh experience they could ever have they're walking with a resurrected lord jesus christ and didn't even know it oh but praise god he he continued on with him he didn't leave him in that condition and all their hearts started to burn within him and i say when you read these things in the scripture the coming of the son of man and the seventh hill and all of these things and and you hear the testimonies oh something in your heart just burns you hear the discerning of the thoughts and intense light and something in your heart burns with it i say oh don't leave it there constrain him to stay say lord my heart's burning within me don't leave me lord come reveal yourself to me i want to know more of your person break the bread of life lord i need revelation oh and then when your eyes come open i'm sorry about it but when you see something you can't unsee it i'm sorry bring bring bring all the nonsense you want to bring and try to tell me this message ain't real come way too late because i've seen it like like when elijah come out there and he had his little servant there and he's all master what are we going to do the syrian army is all surrounding me what are we going to do well there stands a prophet his eyes were already open praise god for a prophet and he said oh lord opened his eyes and when he opened his eyes he saw that there was more with them that were against him oh when your eyes come open all the fear all the doubt all the unbelief everything just vanishes away and no matter what the enemy can throw at you it's too late i'm changed i'm different i got a different nature i'm not living up here in the realms of my carnal mind and theology and trying to piece everything together oh that something's happened i've been changed we must have an anchor we've got to have an anchor that goes beyond tradition it goes beyond works and goes beyond a camp experience it has to be a life there there has to be a prevailing revelation inside of the believer that meets the challenge of the age you can't be living on something from the past and god forbid we be living on an experience from the past so i want to refill him lord i want more and more and more and more that's what jesus says in mark 7 13 he told the sadducees and pharisees he said you make the the word of god of none effect because of your traditions don't use a hay fork and pitch that off to the sadducees and pharisees that's for us we make this message a tradition we make going to church a tradition let me just speak for myself because i don't want to try to to uh uh indict anybody else we work we wake up we work work work work come home work work work come home work work work oh gotta get to church get ready get ready get the kids get the food get the car get there get to church on time oh they're singing songs we're singing songs praise god singing songs the preachers preaching preach preacher preach but oh oh if we if we can if we can get into the spirit if we can get into the unity i often like to challenge myself and think of it like this matter of fact like what what would you do maybe you just think if if if it was brother branham was preaching tonight or if it was paul or your or one of your favorite ministers how about we do that and we can't help it i i it it there's there's a natural tendency to where we allow the routine and we allow the traditions and allow things to become mundane to where it affects our expectation but oh if we can come with such an anticipation in our heart to where at least look you be the one that's so full of the holy ghost and so full of god that your cups so overflow and that people in the song service go like praise god hallelujah i wasn't feeling too good but man this sister gots it tonight she's making me happy bring the joy of the lord to you into the house of god why don't we act like we've been delivered why don't we act like we've been set free why don't we act like we're going in a rapture why don't we praise god like where we're going oh i can't wait to get over there there ain't going to be no hindrances on the other side we'll be dancing and we'll be shouting why i say why wait let's don't wait any longer i'll let the joy of the lord just overflow in your heart oh i ain't trying to i ain't trying to preach fanaticism here but be free be free you want to run you want to scream me you want to shout i never forget a brother called me up one time he was coming home from a ball game and he said oh man man we won we won it at the very end we won it all you know i can't remember if it was the championship or something like that he goes man i was so happy i ran down the stairs i ran back up and i was giving everybody five i said praise the lord brother now we just need to get you to do that in church and i didn't hear for him for a little bit we got back together we represent he's like you know what that was a miserable trip home that night because he's a believer and that penetrated through all the fluff of lady osea through all the temporaries look i've gotten caught up in swine saying there's anything wrong with it i root for the home teams and and i can enjoy those things but it's so easy to get caught up where it affects you emotionally and all of a sudden you're invested and it's actually affecting your peace praise god i learned a long time ago whenever i'm disappointed praise god i'm a christian and i just move that right back that losing season that injured quarterback praise god i i praise god i'm a christian my quarterback can never be injured he was injured on calvary he was put in the grave but he rose on the third day and he'll never be injured again and because i live ye live also oh we got something to sing about we got something to shout about all of this nonsense of the world that we can get all happy about and scream and shout about oh if we can just get into the presence of god and really start to worship i think of david when the ark started to come on oh he just got beside himself he started to dance because what did it represent oh victory was coming back to the camp the presence of the lord was coming back oh and we are sitting on the revealed word of the air victory is in the cap the presence of the almighty god the pillar fire is here he's in you and in you and in you and when we all come together oh what kind of atmosphere should it be oh hallelujah oh these signs shall follow them that believe i'm looking for the manifestation i'm looking to get away from the theology and the mind and the the flesh ways of making this great word of tradition it's easy to do look we we always want it's so easy to condemn the sadducees and pharisees so easy to condemn the israelites and the jews which they were the most religious and most right organized people on the face of the planet that was instituted by god they had moses for their prophet and they had the testimonies but they had got to a place to where when the word continued to unfold and was continued to lead they were stuck in their traditions we we've done it this way in so long when i say oh god may i not be stuck there lord if you want to do something different tonight if you want to do something different in the morning lord here i am if your spirit wants to pour out on us and everybody starts to do uh something of an operation of a gift or rejoicing in the lord whatever you want to do lord i don't want to be so conformed into my mind that things have to go this way and i'm not just speaking of just here in the house of god but in our daily lives don't you be surprised if you're on your way to work and something tells you to make a right-hand turn although we despise the still-small voice of the lord we should be looking for it we had an example in our day who is catching a plane if if anybody what i mean look if you miss an airplane taking off they can't make a left-hand turn and come back and get you you better be there to get through security and be there on time because if that plane leaves you're out of a bunch of money and a bunch of time in my be really hard to get get a son of god or daughter of god now to to well wait a second lord my plane leaves in 30 minutes so that can't be you talking but you know the prophet he was a man just like we are he's our brother and he had to battle the same things oh he's so transparent over and over he's like nope that that's not him but all he would keep pressing keep pressing all of a sudden he he'd learn by then all right bye bye plane and you know the story how it goes there was there was a woman in need who had been praying for an elijah she said where's my elijah and god sent him on this way can god not do that with you can god not use you to be going through your normal day and say you know what why don't you pull aside and pray well we're such a routine we're in such a a busy in the things of the day that we hardly have time for god you know experience is good but it's not good enough i had an experience when i was 12. and i learned something as the years went by i needed to get the spirit of the experience look i was 12 years old i was at youth camp it was supernatural i usually hardened my heart you know i didn't you know when when i was getting towards the climax of the service but you know i'd used up my two bathroom breaks and and i got back into the service and and i was stuck but you know one thing i had going for me i was tired so somebody let me fall asleep but all god was smiling down there because like i said i just i i maybe would have resent to the word but i just remember waking up and i was in the presence of god and something pulled me out of my seat and something pulled me to the front and some pulled me to the baptismal pool and something pulled me in such a way that i knew god was real but you know what i knew god was real but i didn't get the god that revealed himself to me inside of me i didn't feed that fire i didn't continue and when i got back home uh i ended up feeding that black dog and and ended up going out into the world but by his grace i come to know him in the power of his resurrection later on in life but i just want to say that you know experience is good but but we got to have that that we got to have the holy ghost that quickening spirit living inside of us and i just want to read this scripture here corinthians 13 2. i say it it's wonderful when he pours out his spirit has anybody ever been in a church service where the presence of the lord is just moving i've been in church service where it's like in waves you actually see it come over the congregation over here and go towards the back and then come back down the front and the holy ghost just moving it's so thick you want to get a you want to get like a bag and bag it up i want to take it with me but you can you can you can have that holy spirit with you every day of your life you just invite him to come into your heart i read a news article uh here not long ago i think it was a seven-year-old that that committed suicide and every time i read something like that i say god that means our seven-year-olds can be born again and filled with the holy ghost if they can come to a place in their mind where they can make a decision to take their own life i believe our children can come to a place in a decision where they can surrender their life to jesus christ and be filled with the holy ghost if josiah or whatever there was a king that started to reign at seven oh that's in there to let us know that god can use our children and many times god does use our children but maybe we've got too much pride to hear from the mouth of a babe first corinthians 13 2 and though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all the mysteries and knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing if i have not love i am nothing you know there's two types of love there's a filio love and there's an agape love and we know that agape love is the love of god but you know you think of affiliate love that's not to be belittled you know man was made in the image of god and when you start to think of a love of a mother and the love we have for one another and our families and and how we'll lay down our lives and and the very the very love that we possess for one another for our children my it's a very powerful thing you just think of mankind and the ability uh that that they have to show honor and to show patriotism and to lay their life down for somebody else i was i was just moved by looking into this um this article they they have in the arlington cemetery there in virginia it's called the tomb of the unknown soldier has anybody ever heard of that and to my shame i i don't know much about history or i just don't uh keep up on many things and nor feel i have the capacity to try to even retain but this just i never really heard or known of it before i maybe had seen a picture once upon a time but nothing ever grabbed me or caught me but i started to look into this this tomb of the the unknown soldier and there on the tomb i believe it says herein lies a a a an honored american soldier unknown but to god only and the story goes behind what they did with this memorial is through all of the years so through all the wars there's been uh unknown soldiers along the way that have given their lives on the battlefield and they they decided i don't know what president was but he wanted to bring a unknown soldier from from world war one and world war ii in vietnam and and he brought four unknown soldiers to this place and to this tomb as a representation of all of those unknown soldiers that have lost their lives on the battlefield and i thought you know what what an admirable thing to do you know just to to show some type of act of patriotism or show some type of honor to to to they don't even know them reminds me of the scripture that where it says you know when you have charities you show the same love for one another they don't know what this they don't know how they died who they were whether they were run and come and go and what they did but they were showing a value and an appreciation for the life that was was was was given on the sacrifice of freedom and i started to look at this and and what they do is these soldiers they they they're called tomb guards and they guard that tomb 24 hours a day seven days a week 365 days a year 24 7 and they've been doing it since 1937. rain sunshine sleet snow whatever you call it they're there because they say they want that unknown soldier to rest in dignity and somebody to be there and i got to thinking about that my just think of of of the effort and the time and these soldiers uh they're dressed and they're so immaculate it takes them eight hours to prep their uniform and get prepared to go out there and stand guard and after they've they've gone through all the the routine and they make sure there's not a lit and everything is just perfect and they come out there and they do the walk and they do 21 steps and it's to signify a 21 gun salute and they look up for 21 seconds 21 gun salute which is the highest honor that you can give to a fallen soldier and they do that changing of the guard every hour or sometimes every 30 minutes they've been doing that since 1937 for soldiers that are unknown in a tomb and i was just thinking in my heart if if mankind if mankind could show that type of commitment and that type of love or appreciation or patriotism for somebody they didn't even know or somebody they never even met i said oh god if they can do that in the filio oh can't be a godly love that you've shed a bride of my heart can't i give all to you and you're not in the tomb anymore but you've risen and ascended on high and you've sent your comforter back i said oh god why can't i give my all to you why can i surrender i want that agape love where i can commit my whole life to 365 days a year seven days a week every minute of every hour we can have that type of love and that type of an experience praise the lord i'd say i'd find a place to close but i really didn't have no place to start or stop so we'll just ask the musicians to come and we'll they would just read a quote in closing or if the spirit leads and we take off again we'll just however the lord leads if he does something different tonight that's alright amen i told jackson maybe we'll just have him come up and say something wait we we wouldn't do that to him though but corinthians goes on to say charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they shall fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there be knowledge it shall vanish away the love of god is never going to fail it goes beyond the flesh it goes beyond the mind it produces a faith that's unwavering i was just thinking of the children of israel how they had the experience they had the word they had the law and yet when it came to kadesh barnea they'd come out under the blood they'd come through the red sea when it came time for them to cross over into the promised land they came to cadis barnea they came to a judgment seat they came to a time of testing the prophet said god always test his children by the word if you believe his word god tests you by his word our pastor on sunday said satan's always trying to change the narrative they were more than able to take the land but satan wanted to change the narrative so when the spies got back they started to give an evil report they started to say oh we're like grasshoppers and and all they're they're built up and they're strong and there's no way that we could ever take it and the people think of this i try to think of it in my mind but it just shows that oh there has to be a predestinated seed there has to be an election there has to be an ability to go past the mind and down into the heart where you're not believing with the mind but you're believing with the seed faith that god has placed there that no matter what comes up against you you're anchored because here these these are the same ones that were signed and crying because of the bondage they were in egypt these are the same ones that rejoiced when moses came as their deliverer and now they've they've they've seen the plagues they've seen the mighty hand they've seen the red sea party they've seen the pillar of fire in the cloud by night they've seen all these wonderful things but now when they come to kadesh barnea somebody starts preaching a false narrative somebody starts preaching you know this message really isn't everything that moses said it was and these same people that came out by a mighty strong end started to doubt whether they were able to take the land oh it's in there for principle because if you try to think that in your mind like you mean they saw the plagues come they saw the red sea part they saw their enemy swallowed up in the red sea they were fed with mana they they had quail come in uh the the rock was smitten we saw the pillar of fire we heard god speak to us over and over testimony after testimony and they had seen it with their own eyes and these same people when these spies come back and start to give a negative report they start to say oh why did you leave us out here why did you lead us out here we we would you have us die here and they started to ask for for for a captain to take him back to egypt but i love how caleb stealed the people and he said no no we're more than able to take it we're more than able to take the land and i say the same thing to you you're more than able to possess the land you're more than able to overcome a negative report you're more than able to overcome if you can't find some news article on so many people falling off a bridge you're more than able to overcome a negative report you're more than able to overcome if he wasn't over here and the cloud was on you're way more able to overcome that because it's not you that liveth but it's christ that liveth in you and it's that quickening power that has come down on the inside of you it will raise you out of the grave let's stand i'm gonna put sister nikki on the spot that song you sang the other night was awesome who played the piano for you praise the lord that's a good jubilee song right there let's praise the lord i've been wanting to hear that song again so there's our different that's our mix-up for tonight i believe that'll be a good way to to end the service we have sister nikki come sing that song for us but oh i just pray something that was said that could oh that could just encourage us the prophet said brother when you hear that scream there's something in you you're an eagle to begin with why you are the seed that the resurrection of the s-o-n has dawned in the wave sheath upon the earth to make you recognize that you're an eagle and not a denominational chicken you see it now if the spirit that raised him from the dead the word the dynamic of the word dwells in you it also quickens your mortal body now how are we flesh of his flesh and bone of his bone because quickly while we were yet mortal sinners mortal ready to die these bodies it quickened that body what's quick and brings to life the spirit that once liked to drink run around commit adultery and all these all these things it's quickened why the thing died and you are resurrected it quickens your mortal bodies therefore your body is the temple of the dynamics because why from the beginning you are part of the mechanics oh there's your resurrection there is the church in the resurrection with him these bodies right now are quick and see you've heard you believe it changed you from a denomination to the word see the dynamics it comes upon the water the dynamics if it comes upon water it'll just sputter days of miracles are passed oh i believe the bible pom-pom papa but there ain't no pop-pop pop see but when it hits that 1000 octane room aware goes you see oh my the dynamics strike that but it'll strike a chicken it won't do no good but when it strikes the eagle he moves out amen the dynamics with the mechanics see what i mean that's it if it's a true eagle now he will understand oh not a not a theology you say brother matthew what do i do i see the massacre would i i recognize that i want to believe what the prophets say just start flopping your wings just not he didn't say start soaring like an eagle he said just start doing something just raise your ass say oh god help me lord i repent lord forgive me of all i says start to testify on the tape of our pastor mentioned on sunday brother branham said look if you're a housewife pick up the phone and call somebody if you're a young person change your status change your profile do something to testify to god oh and watch that quickening power change you hallelujah amen if y'all could come at this time amen you may be seated
