on our own accord Lord and it set you you saw this night before there was a world Lord and you you predestinated us to be here you you even predestinated these needs father that lay upon this sacred desk father and that we would hold these needs before you Lord because you're a God that desires to be known father desires to be worshiped with a cause behind it praise that has real meaning behind it father and we're attempting to do that today as we think of all your goodness toward us Lord and so fathers I've been chosen to stand up here and pray father feeling unworthy but yet Lord I Lift

female lord that feels that she was born false witness against her and lost her job may you undertake for Lord father we offer our our tithes and our offerings father and we commit the rest of the service to you we commit the man of God into your hands may you help him to put himself to one side in me father you come on the scene and deliver the burden that you've placed upon his heart through this vessel that you've chosen and father May the word the Lord that's spoken father may we be able to receive it and predestinated prepared ground Lord that it bring forth fruit that would be worthy of the laborers father they ask these things in Jesus name amen it's hard this song out of my heart this way it's I just love to praise him so I wanted to sing that song every praise to our God and that KFC please I like to praise Him amen every praise is to our God every word of worship [Music] Every Praise every praise is to our God [Music] to our God peace is [Music] to our God oh God my

[Music] let's just stand as we just invite the man of God to come out at this time I believe I I have expectations you know sometimes what we feed upon the wheat could be the very word that confirms it behind the pulpit where you know it's God speaking to a man and so it's good to be under expectation for God to come on the scene in every service let it not just be tradition let it not be just a way of of just gathering together because we want to see our friends or we want to just see one another but God by Divine promises in our midst and there shall be a reverence and an expectation for the word of God let's just sing this song as we just invite the man of God he looked beyond my fault and saw my name Amazing Grace Amazing Grace shalom I'll always be my song of praise [Music] foreign

Jesus [Music] Christ [Music] amen praise the Lord aren't you thankful for mercy and Grace for love that can look beyond the fault and see the need amen why don't we just approach him Lord Jesus we're needy tonight and Lord the more Revelation that we receive and the more we know you in the power of your Resurrection Lord there's a paradox we we know there's more of you that we need Lord When We're Young we feel like we can do many things and when we come to know you in the burden of sin is lifted and we just feel like we can soar through the heavenlies and many times with that Lord comes that juvenile attitude and the inability to have certain wisdoms that's needed but as we travel on this side Lord we we learn from you in your word to grow and to be nurtured and to be corrected Lord and to wait upon you Lord for your word says they that wait upon the Lord they shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as an eagle they shall run and not faint Lord we want to wait upon you tonight that you just come Lord do it only you can do and break the bread of life to your people many have come out to the house of God and lord they're hungry they they need you and I need you Lord we all want to make that confession tonight Lord that we're we're here because we we need you Lord but we pray that the moment we took to sing some songs Lord that it was pleasing to you because you're worthy of the praise and the Adoration and now Lord we Just Surrender ourselves to you that you just come now and Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen just ask you to turn in your Bibles we'll just read out of Romans 8 28. thank you Romans 8. 28 would read like this and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose if you want to just turn over in your Bibles to Ephesians chapter 3. verse 9 through 11. and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now unto the principle principality and powers and Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our lord amen you you may be seated brother Brandon would make a statement he would say you were made for an eternal purpose because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God and just uh just remembering some of the things that we spoke on recently uh just speaking on rapturing faith the faith for this hour that God has placed you here because you are an attribute of himself that he wanted to be here in this present time knowing the condition that the world would be in he he understood the uh the trials he understood uh The Temptations he knew how bad it would be but you know I as I just think upon those lines you wouldn't whenever maybe somebody's putting together an army or something like that they're going to strategically pick certain ones who might have certain strengths and capabilities and and maybe somebody who's a has a good eyesight and he's a good Hunter and he's maybe able to to shoot a rifle really good you might recruit him to be a sniper you might put him in the nest up there so he can be a sniper and he can he can be able to zoom in on the targets and be able to hit the target and other people I might be more qualified as footmen and then you get into the certain ranks of the military uh there's special qualified people that really make it into the air force that can really uh uh uh be able to uh get into those airplanes and when they get up there they call it a G-Force and and as they're pressing in these airplanes and they're they're breaking the sound barriers they come under such a great amount of pressure there's a G-Force that's pressing upon them that not very many people are able to handle the pressure uh because what happens as they start getting up there in 7g force AJ well well a normal civilian would have already been been gone by then you know I it wasn't here too long ago you know when you're when you're younger and your youth you know you can get on the rides and everything and nothing nothing bothers you you can see these little kids they'll just turn in circles and circles and circles and nothing ever bothers them anymore it wasn't too long ago I I went to the kids to Six Flags and and I I mean I tell you I hear about people on rides you know like can you believe that guy got light-headed that guy passed out we got on the Titan we started pulling around the corner and everything started narrowing down all right wait a second you're getting old because because as you get a little bit older maybe you're not cut out for it anymore because it takes a certain conditioning it takes a certain gifted person to be able to to get in that airplane and to break through the sound barrier and to be recruited into the army and you get into the Navy Seals I can't remember how many hundreds or thousands of people try to to make it through the Navy Seals and and you know there's only a few that come out on the other side that actually can graduate and make it maybe can call themself a seal well I want to tell you that God was putting together an army and I could maybe think they're in the ramparts of Glory uh where you were when the sons of God shouted for joy that what God looked down and he looked down into the lady to see a church age he saw how Wicked it was going to be he saw how evil it was going to be and he thought you know what I want to have my very past I want to have the cream of the crop I I I want to put you there I want to put David there I want to put brother Tim there I want to put brother Ben wall sister April uh sister Holly sister Gabrielle I got certain ones that I want to be manifested in that time in that hour because it's the very attribute it's the very expression it's something that I want to manifest to the world that I'm the same yesterday today and forever you you were placed here because you have a special ability to be able to withstand the test to be able to withstand the pressure that when the devil would hurl his doubts at you and and and all of the things that they're starting to to come up with now in this day and age you know they they have this new thing called AI AI does anybody know what AI stands for I think it stands for Rubble if you look into the Bible when when Joshua and them came up to AI there was something something significant in that story because when they came up to AI somebody was hiding something in their heart you know I think AI has a special ability to find out what you're hiding to find out what your behavior is and and how you you navigate through websites and through material and AI has a special ability to find out your weaknesses and the thing that catches your eye and how much time you spend on this internet site how many times you looked at that dress and how many times you looked at that profile don't you realize Somebody's Watching You you know they they they they they got algorithms and things nowadays as you as you swipe they actually time how long you pause on each uh each image and it registers oh he paused on that for two seconds he didn't turn his head you know it's it's it's watching out for your actions and it's making all these documentations of how how you respond and how you act and and and you know it's it's interesting about this AI that they're coming out with you look into the Bible you know there's nothing new Under the Sun right you go looking in your Bible and I believe it was AI that Joshua and the children of Israel were coming up to go into battle is that right and they were going to to conquer Ai and what happened to Joshua they got defeated and Joshua fell on his face and said Lord what is this why why would it be when we would come uh to fight against the enemy that we would turn our backs to the enemy well Joshua was having a pity party but you know what God told him to do Joshua get up get up Joshua there's sin in the camp somebody's taken of the Forbidden thing they're hiding something in their heart and now what we need you to do is we need you to go before the children of Israel and and we need you to have the families come up one by one and we're going to find out who it is that's holding these things in their heart and in their life that is causing the army of God to fail you know the prophet of God said that your attitude your attitude can knock somebody out out of their healing it's what he said so then I think when we come to the house of God when we have interactions with our brothers and sisters I want to tell you your attitude matters your attitude can determine the success of this service now don't let these be idle wears like God speak to you tonight because your attitude can affect the outcome of this service your attitude could be the difference between if somebody is healed or not healed now I'm not blazing that on my words I'm looking into the message of the hour and knowing that a Vindicated Prophet told me Matthew McGarry's son you understand that's your attitude we we got to be tutored we got to be taught look look that's what's tutoring and teaching the Bride of Jesus Christ is the message of the hour and the word and the Holy Spirit is the same thing if you want to know what the Holy Ghost is saying it's good evening friends good evening friends that's what the Holy Ghost is saying to the bride of Christ it's teaching you molding you and shaping you and he said Matthew your attitude can be the difference it can knock somebody out of their healing he would go on to say and and in your unconfessed sins of you believers Oh you mean you Believers he said you're unconfessing of you Believers can cause this church to bitterly fail our unconfessed sins now what we really want is the Lord to do heart surgery because my Bible tells me that we need to be in one mind and one Accord the prophet of God said I long to see the day when sin is called out at the door like ananias and Sapphira if we can start getting into one mind in one Accord but something that broken the unity there at AI somebody had had partaken of the things of the world and they'd hid him in their heart they'd buried it in the midst of their tit and when Aiken is that right is it Aiken when he when he when he came before Joshua when he asked him is it true have you taken of the accursed thing see Aiken was that the re was the one responsible for the lives of other believers think of it now his unconfessed sin caused the church to bitterly fail and here we're going into a battle come on Church we're fighting to go in our rapture we have moms and dads fighting for their prodigal sons and prodigal daughters and we sit back and what are we doing to fight oh there ought to be a shaking in the church there ought to be something in the believer that's causing us to move into an act into into action as our pastor was preaching on investments we want to be investing in the right things I I want to invest in a word that will produce rapturing faith I want to invest into something that's drawing me closer to the Lord but we find the struggle of this age as now we have things like Ai and and this artificial intelligence don't you realize that all of these things are targeted against the Bride of Jesus Christ well it may be in its Inception uh maybe there's some uh I don't even want to call it innocency to it I just can only say what the prophet said he said Science Education religion all of these things it's of the devil so anytime we see some great advancement anytime we see some new WoW technology don't if I'll think for one second that Satan is not trying to get his hands on these things to try to use it against the Bride of Jesus Christ you know you get into study about this this AI technology and it manipulates statements and material and it can come up with its own explanation on Experts uh subjects because it's able to gather from here and it's able to gather from all over these places and now they're using AI to produce material and to manipulate things you know even in China that that the the regime over there oh I can't remember what the guy's name is we'll call them Dr Oz I don't know what is he cheese in Jew he is trying to change the Bible did you know that they actually looked in there and they found out that the story of the woman that was caught in adultery and that was thrown at the feet of Jesus they said it actually undermined the authority of the state so we got to change that story so they rewrote it and introduced it to some people on a college campus that where Jesus actually stoned her for her sin because they didn't want something in the literature that would give somebody an ability to to come out from underneath the law well if they're already trying to do that over in China and they're that this Qi guy is trying to distort the Bible and I thought it was really profound as as our our brother uh championed if you will how great it was to be able to finally get a Bible uh translated as close to the original as possible and get it into the hands of the for the people in China and right after this great work was done it would just seem that the government regime is now putting something else in action why because he wants to take the word out of the hands of the people and no doubt they're going to try to use technology to start to try to take the message of the hour out of the hands of the people start to try to change the uh the text and try to manipulate it and try to form their own thoughts and their own adult look they were splicing tapes back there in the 40s and 50s they were taking real to reels and cutting them and cutting out portions and trying to make the prophet say things he didn't say you don't think they're going to try to do it today you don't think there's websites and AI technology and all of these things that they're trying to get together what is it all trying to do it's trying to come against the Bride of Jesus Christ to take the word of God from you to try to make you a dead formal cold church but there ought to be something in your heart that's fighting for the word of God that wants to make an investment into something that matters I want to make an investment in the message of the hour I want to make an investment in the third pool I want to make an investment in understanding what the voice is saying to the church he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit say it to the church our pastor spoke about a faith that changes things faith that changes I want a faith that changes things anybody here need a change I need a change oh I need a change I want to change I'm longing for a change you might not know you need a change you need to change we all need a change and I want to tell you you're living in the hour that change has been promised for the Bride of Jesus Christ you might be walking in a dead dying generation of the world with sin everywhere but you're living under a promise that in a moment in a twinkling of an eye you're going to be changed I say there ought to be something in the bride of Christ tonight that is longering that's hungering and thirsting for a change something to change your body something to change your attitude something to change what's driving you what's motivating you yeah they make the statement in the world what gets you up in the morning when you wake up what do you look forward to is it your video game is it check in your profile see if you got any likes did I get any likes today I got one more subscriber I'm up to 11. woo honey look I'm up to 11 subscribers if I just get 893 892 more subscribers I can actually make some money to an expense at what cost oh Investments that's not going to produce a faith that changes things but I want a faith that changes things maybe if you'll turn into your Bibles we'll just see if we can allow the Lord to have his way a little bit this evening into Deuteronomy we'll just read uh Deuteronomy chapter 11. verse 26 . I like this uh just speaking about uh making an investment and a faith that changes things look at this right here in Deuteronomy 11 26. I was going to promise I'll be short tonight but Promises of man are made to be broken so I'm not going to promise anything but maybe we'll just get out of here and just a little bit of time but just reading now here in Deuteronomy chapter 11. if I can get there I know it's in my Bible Deuteronomy 11 verse 26. behold I set before you this day a blessing and a curse now I want to just tell you that every day there's something set before you is a blessing and a curse a blessing if you obey the Commandment of the Lord your God which I command unto you and the curse if you will not obey the Commandment of the Lord your God but turn aside from the way which I have commanded you this day to go after other gods which you have not known and it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God hath brought thee unto the land whether thou ghost to possess it that thou shalt put the blessing upon Mount Israel and the curse upon Mount evil and they are on the other side of Jordan by the way where the sun goeth down in the land of the Canaanites which dwell in the what is this campaign over against gilgal beside the plains of Mora for you shall pass over Jordan to go into possess the land which the Lord God giveth you and ye shall possess it and dwell therein and ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments with I set before you this day he says behold I sat before you a blessing and a curse well if you don't obey the word of the Lord there's a law of reaping and sowing right this message is filled with blessings we even read that that that that quote uh last service about we're in the judgment but there's been Mercy that's been extended unto the Bride of Jesus Christ by the revelation of Malachi 4 5 that the Capstone has come cry in Grace Grace it's the grace of God to you it's the love of God to you but when you wake up I say there's something set before you uh this day a blessing and a curse there's a blessing if you heed the words of the Lord but if you reject the word of the Lord and you turn into the things of the world there's a curse in that but as we read in our opening text praise God that it says that all things work together for good you know I love the the prophet's life and how how transparent he was you know he got out there I believe in South Africa and the angel of the Lord told him to go to Durban South Africa but these these businessmen in these these these leaders they these religious leaders they had a whole campaign drawn up and they said oh brother Brandon we need you to go this way and the angel of the Lord was telling them you need to go to Durbin but he just felt such a pressure from these from these businessmen and you know they had the finances and they had the the vehicles to take him to where he could go and he and he just kind of felt pressured he felt handcuffed he felt like he he couldn't he couldn't do much about it and all of a sudden along that way what was he doing the prophet of God was walking in the permissive will I believe one of the meetings they went and it was all set up with these tits and this Monsoon came and just totally blew the place apart and brother band was like I told y'all I told you I got to get into Durbin and he was getting all of the all these problems were happening and everything uh what what was just it wasn't right and brother Branham knew it he was feeling it and then the angel of the Lord came and he was talking to him and he said go ahead go on just continue on but it's the permissive will but when he finally got to where he was supposed to be that's where the blessing was and you know it was in that trip and that permissive will where brother Brandon picked up those amoebas in his stomach and he battled that for years he battled that for years now have we come to the place where where we're not subject to the word to where we can just walk contrary to the will of God we can walk contrary to the message of the hour we can come when we feel like it when the church doors are open well we don't have to come on Sunday night because I already I already did my duty uh there's other things that I want to do there's other Investments that I want to make look if the prophet of God who gave his whole life for this word and for this message slept on the pulpit on the platform night after night after night practically traveling around the world seven times lost his wife and his his baby girl and his family and everybody left him and he stood alone he stood alone now with everybody that you knew walked away from the message of the hour could you stand alone well I know you could that's why God put you here he said I got one I like the story in the Old Testament about I believe I believe Goliath when he comes out and makes this boast he says give me a man I can see God laughing up in the rare parts of Glory I got one he's on his way down there just just hold on Goliath give me a man I got one for you just just hold on here he comes in but uh he's carrying a a bucket of cheese little Ruddy guy coming down didn't even look like a man just look like a boy but David was an attribute of God David had been anointed David had been placed there for the purpose to be anointed king over Israel and there was no devil in hell that was going to stop the purpose of God and you've been put here by an eternal purpose to manifest the message of the hour so then I asked you what can stop you if your friends turn on you if you're your neighbor if your family if the church if everything walked away there's something in you that even if you're walking in the wrong thing if you can just repent in your eyes say Lord I know I've messed up I know I've made a mistake I know I'm not where I'm supposed to be Lord but you said you work all things out for good Lord here I am father I'm repenting of my sins forgive me for my Wicked Ways Lord search My Heart Lord search me try me oh God and I know Lord if you'll come down tonight father you can correct my heart you can correct my life you can get me back on track oh God because you work all things out together for my good and I believe the story goes when brother Branham showed up there in Durban there was such a mighty move that they were packing truck fulls of stretchers and crutches because God knows how to take what's wrong and make it right and maybe if I could say it in the most simple way there's a lot of things in our lives that's wrong and we need to come up higher it's time to set our wings it's time to really if we're going to enter into this rapturing faith the faith for this hour if we're really going to make an investment into what counts and what matters I sat before you this day a blessing and a curse which one are you going to choose see when you when you when you when you grow and you uh mature and you get older really a lot of what it comes down to is discipline you know if you're if you're the owner of a company and you're hiring somebody you know nowadays a college degree really just says that you can pay attention and show up somewhere okay this guy can pay attention and eagerly show up on time for x amount of days I can use something because people get college degrees all the time now and they they practice in fields they didn't even study they're looking to get a job and they put out their application and it's like well why are you working over there well there was nothing in the field but that why did they hire you because people just want somebody that can be disciplined that could show up to work on time that can do what they're told and I say that you know this bride needs to be mature we need to be disciplined we need to study to show ourselves approved and have a pattern of good works because we always wonder why we're slipping back into the areas of our life and we wonder why we're going through the cycles because we're not being disciplined we give in to so many things and that's one thing about the age that that makes so many things available to us but I'm just so thankful that that God knows how to take the wrong and make it right if you just turn over to your Bibles uh maybe we'll just see if we can Fellowship around this for a moment see if the Lord would be pleased with this and maybe somebody uh here this evening is uh it needs to make a a decision or they've they've made some decisions and they're suffering the consequences of it uh just let's focus on that opening text how God will work everything out for good this is a wonderful story in the Bible if you just flip over a couple more chapters in the Deuteronomy chapter 23 this is just a thought that was on my heart a while back and uh it's picking up in the story of Balaam and I just want to read verse 5 because he's he's he's speaking now how how how how the children of Israel are crossing through Moab and and Baal he he he's just afraid of these people uh gobbling up all of his his uh uh the grasses of the land and everything he's heard the fame of them going forth and he doesn't want nothing to do with them so he's actually went and gotten uh Balaam and he's asked Balaam look Balaam I want you to curse these people I I want you to curse him and so now uh Balaam being being a prophet a false prophet for that matter but he had the order he had the approach he knew how to approach God he went before God and the scripture would say this and in that shed it would say in Deuteronomy chapter 23 verse 5 see nevertheless the Lord thy God would not hearken an abalone but the Lord thy God turn the curse into a blessing unto thee because the Lord thy God loved thee or if that ain't something that you can anchor your heart on in this hour that you you've been born under a curse you've been born in the most cursed age the world has ever known it's gone into a blackout a complete apostasy Isaiah 61 gross Darkness upon the land and gross Darkness upon the people and the devil wants to curse you he wants to hold you captive he wants to hold you in bondage he wants to take your mistakes and your failures and point to your past and and maybe times you were taken advantage of his scars and things that you're carrying in their life that you feel you can never Shake loose of where the devil wanted to curse you God takes the curse and he makes it into a blessing why does he do that what's the rest of that scripture say because he loves you love does that love covers a multitude of sin now what about us the only thing that can enter there is perfect love well if love covers a multitude of sins some of us need to cover the sins of our brothers and sisters we're quick to talk about it we're quick to expose it to one another if somebody doesn't respond right if somebody doesn't have the right reaction did you hear what so-and-so said do you think they were trying to do this they're always trying to put their input on this but love should cover a multitude of sin if you feel like your brother's in a fault or you feel like they didn't handle something right we should go and onto our knees into prayer we should be praying about it we should be seeking the Lord we can say oh he might not have meant that and maybe you can be a part of the solution God can put a word on your heart and maybe in Fellowship you can know I might have would have handled that a little differently because I think your brother got offended when you said that that's what love does love covers a multitude of sin God knows how to take the curse and turn it into a blessing we could just look down through story after story in the Bible and see how there was ones of our brothers or sisters who came into a situation of cursing and God was able to take that curse and turn it into a blessing one of my favorite stories in the Bible is Joseph how Joseph was hated of his brother and he was sold into slavery cursed but wherever Joseph went he was blessed because God can take the curse and make it a blessing oh don't you realize that's why you're sitting here tonight why you why are you sitting here tonight because somebody loved you because somebody loved you is why you're sitting here tonight you'd be out there in the drug house you'd be out there in the jail cell you'd be out there in prison you'd be laying up in the morgue you'd be out there in the graveyard you'd be so lost down in denominationals you would be some Catholic or some Baptist so far away from God you didn't know nothing about it but oh God rich and mercy somebody that loved you pulled you out of the mucking admire he gave you an ear to hear that great Eagle stream and call you out of the Barnyard how can I get there how can I make it I just saw jump son just Slap Your Wings just give it a try what did that somebody that loved you somebody that could take a life with no hope with no chance but then God would smile upon you with love and compassion and say you're you're my attribute have an eternal purpose I have a plan for your life I I have something that I want to do with you I'm going to change your life from a curse and turn it into a blessing I love that story of Joseph he gets all the way down to the end and you know he puts his his brothers rightfully so gives him a little bit of a hard time wants to find out if his his daddy is still alive and they come by and he hides a cup on them and now they got to bring their little his little brother and now he finally sees his little Brethren and now you know okay man eat you your little brother stole a cup now I'm going to keep your little brother like oh my goodness now my father's really going to die if you keep the youngest one you'd understand oh oh well what is it to you oh you don't understand you know this is from the mother with we had another brother that that he's been gone oh yeah is it so is that really what happened is that the truth is that really why you're doing the things that you're doing is that really why you're living the way that you're living not really the way that I'm saying all these things is because we made a really bad decision a lot of years ago and we've been suffering for it ever since and what we really need to do is repent oh the grace of God was there to tell them I am Joseph don't be afraid what you meant for evil God has used it to preserve and save much life oh that's the God we serve the god that can take our hopeless situation that can take a terrible decision that you made years ago and he can come to you in sweetness and whisper in your ear a love secret say don't worry my child I'm going to take the curse and I'm going to make it a blessing oh we want to move into rapturing faith we want to move into a faith that changes things we want to move into a position where we'll ask him and we'll know what we'll we'll have what we ask for you know Esther's situation didn't really seem too good her being pulled away from the only family she knew but Mordecai spoke those words to her and said maybe you've come to the kingdom for such a time as this and Esther had to make a decision either I'm here for a reason or I'm not we need to make a decision Church we're either here for a reason or we're not what reason are you here for this might shock you you're not here to get an education that might be your occupation but that's not why you're here did I say education occupation some people become career students Forever Learning but you get an education to get an occupation but that's not why you're here we need to make a decision why we're here you know when you wake up and you have a job you got a job to do and typically you have instructions I used to work at McDonald's shocking it's a good job it'll teach you things not that hard somehow the same work has become harder for the newer Generations I lived right here about 700 feet in that direction 15 year old I walked down the hill I went to McDonald's I had on my uniform I went in there I took orders at the register I went out I cleaned the cleaned the lobby I swept the floor I took out the trash and I learned how to tie a trash bag you put a little knot on there put it around there really holds it on there when everybody throws in all their full drinks and everything it won't come off the sides I had a job to do though that's what I was hired for was to go there and take orders wipe down the tables clean the floor clean the bathroom I didn't walk down the hill wondering well what am I going to do today I'm going to show up to work and I'm going to walk in and hey boss so what do you want me to do today the same thing you've been doing every day maybe that's the problem for Christians reporting to duty you don't know what to do because you haven't been doing anything testify do something get on fire for God if you don't know what to do here's an altar find out what it is and I tell you when when you get when you take the gospel when you get borned again oh and you get filled with the Holy Ghost now you got marching orders it ain't a question you don't show up to the job you don't show up into the into the church and say well I wonder what I need to do today no there's something inside of you on that day when they were gathered in the upper room in the pillar of fire dropped down oh they came spilling out of there and they came out into the streets they were speaking in tongues they looked like a bunch of wild men and everybody looked at them and presumed what are these men are they drunk and Peter stood there says no these men are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which was prophesied by the prophet Joel I'll pour out my spirit Hallelujah they didn't need some somebody to tell them what to do they had the inside teacher what we need in the Church of God is the inside teacher we need to get born again and that'll tell you how to go to work oh if we get so far down the road with with Theology and leave out Calvary something's wrong we need births we we need people born again we need people to weep their way to Calvary and come in contact with a real God and say Lord I really don't have what I thought I had I'm listening to tapes I'm going to church I'm going to work but I really don't see that change that says in your word that you become a new creature old things pass away and All Things become new I say there ought to be a hunger there ought to be a desire in the heart of God's people say Lord change me tonight make me different make me new give me marching orders that I can stand like they did on the day of Pentecost and say this is that what was prophesied a real change because when you wake up you know what you're here for eternal life is living for others it's not to condemn you sometimes the reason we don't witness and do the things that we should because we need something more that's okay it's okay to need more is that all right Church is it okay to want the Holy Ghost is it okay not to have the Holy Ghost and want it if this church ever becomes so stuffed shirt where somebody feels out of place because they ain't got the the badge that I'm in the club I would rather somebody be honest and sincere and say I see the life of the Prophet I see the life of Our Lord I see what's on the tapes and I don't have it God bless you God can do something with that but if all we can do is quote it and and quote the Bible and quote it and go about our careers and never live it that's not what this is about this is about being changed that's what the prophet was what was was trying to bring to the church he said we can hardly have enough faith for Divine Healing but we got to have the faith for this hour to be changed to be caught away that's going to come with a a deep Earnest sincerity a deep crave and a deep hunger for revelation and for more of God but we find out that this cursed world that's pressing in around us and all of the pressure everything is designed to try to keep you from your purpose oh we gotta wake up oh my remember who your greatest enemy is who's your greatest enemy you know my greatest enemy is in the building your greatest enemy is here it's not your neighbor it's not your co-worker you're the Rascal and we have to wake up with a purpose that we got to possess this vessel with sanctification and honor we got to make it subject to the word and to know that we're here for a purpose what is your purpose remember it's not your occupation now that we want to be we want to be led by the Holy Spirit we want to be not hearers of the word only but we want to be doers of the word so then there should be a format if you will for your life not not tell you not to walk by not to walk by faith and to act like you'd have to have everything mapped out but we want to be looking unto the Lord for his leadership in his Direction if you're led by the spirit of God you are the sons of God but everything around you is pressing you in such a way it's trying to have you led by something else and I'm just trying maybe to tie something together what's causing us not to give in to that leadership it's the curse of this flesh don't you realize ever since Adam and Eve fail you're born under a curse Adam had Dominion Adam had control he he had full Authority there and until they came out from the protection of the word and he sold mankind into slavery he sold the world into death and into bondage and you're born under that curse that's why some of our lives maybe you came into a family that didn't even believe in God and you had hard family circumstances you experience things that that no little girl should ever experience and there's pains and there's hurts and there's things that have come upon your life that that that you feel like it's a curse because mankind oh mankind is rotten to the Core it's just a it's just a beast an animal if you don't believe me read the news but I don't recommend it prophet of God said in 1963 said if the world continues another 50 Years it'll be totally insane we're here look around we're here the world's totally insane and now we're living amongst a people that's totally insane and and born into family situations and generational sins and and generational curses and and medical conditions and all of these things and you feel like oh I'm living under a curse yeah maybe maybe so that's pretty good analogy because the world's cursed the flesh is cursed but I'm so glad I serve a god who knows how to take the curse and turn it into a blessing God knows how to take the mistakes he knows how to take things that were wrong he knows how to take the mistakes and the failures why don't you just let them go into your heart we'll try to come to a close quickly by Hearts desires I want to move into this realm of rapturing faith into the faith for this hour I I I I want to live what our pastor's been talking about about having having a faith that changes things I want to make an investment into the word of God that will produce the character of the word in me maybe maybe It just strikes me maybe maybe this is what the service needs to be about some of us just need to de-invest tonight there it is you know what that is you know what it means to deinvest if you've ever made an investment it means you you put money into maybe a program if you got stocks and bonds and all those things and and and you want to try to make some money and you're like okay well I'm going to put twenty thousand dollars on uh AI technology and you start looking at the stocks and the value is just going down what that means is your twenty thousand dollars is no longer worth twenty thousand dollars anymore because you bought into a company that's sinking and all of a sudden you're twenty thousand dollars is sixteen thousand dollars and then you keep thinking well I'm just gonna hold on here because it gots to rebound and then it gets down to ten thousand you start to think well I I better just take my money and run and right when you pull your money out it starts to climb back up and you're like oh man it's climbing fast I'm gonna put another 20 in there and then it starts going back down back down and you get on a little roller coaster ride and you get a year or two down the road and all of a sudden you realize I've lost thousands you know what I'm just gonna be done with this so when you deinvest you know what you do you take your money out of it I think some of us have invested our time and our effort into things that are failing and if this church this group of believers foreign if we could get in one mind and one Accord I even believe this at the end of this service if some of us right now can start to think I'm going to de-invest that game that boy that girl that career that job it's not according to the word of God Lord I'm going to de-invest right now forgive me that's all it takes that's it you know that's all it takes Lord I've made some bad decisions I I I got some deep scars but choose you this day you can continue that line and it can be a curse unless the musicians to come or you can choose life I believe that's what Deuteronomy would say and people put up Deuteronomy 30 19. maybe an awkward service but I believe God can take what would appear to be foolishness of man and do something Supernatural to the individual Deuteronomy 30 19 says I call Heaven and Earth to record this day against you that I have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live say Lord I want to deinvest oh if ananias and Sapphire could have done it all over they tried to make an investment into both [Music] and I think that's maybe a lot of the problem that we have as we're trying to invest in both [Music] we're trying to invest in the world okay and we're trying to invest into the spiritual if you sow to the flesh you shall reap corruption if you sow to the spirit you shall read righteousness but can both bitter and clean water come from the same fountain I say no maybe a a little bit of an evangelistical service or so tonight but if we can leave out of here feeling refreshed feeling cleansed can I say praise God I don't know what curse you're living under I don't know what decisions I don't know what Challengers you're facing and you feel you feel beat down and you feel like you're not making any progress you feel stale you feel like you haven't had a touch from the Lord in years why don't we change that tonight I know somebody that can do something for you some of you young people you were on fire for God I saw it [Music] you get a little time down the down the down the way and it just seems like the fire starts to die out [Music] but you know you can Stoke that fire tonight [Music] every single one of us from the front to the back all it takes is to say you know what that's true Lord Here I Am Lord Lord what he's saying is true think about it think about what he done for you I think about our young sister coming back from camp and the power of dropped it to the van and all them young sisters were on fire for God by saying that's changed what I'm saying is he's the same yesterday today and forever [Music] we go through Seasons we go through times we go we we we we we have uh Winters and springs and Summers but if I'm trying to convey that if if you're feeling you're not where you want to be foreign [Music] let's just all bow our head Lord Jesus may be a little bit of a strange service tonight Lord but if it causes one sinner to repent more than maybe that's what it we need to do is de-invest we're living in an hour where we need to redeem the time and there's so many things pulling Upon Our Life Lord that we don't invest into the things that really matter relax Lord we we just want to tell you that we're sorry for that Lord I want to be on fire for you I want to ask that you forgive me Lord for not being diligent and being idle and not pressing for the kingdom like I should Lord I want to say as David say restore unto me the joy of my salvation Lord I'm thankful that you're able to take the curse and make it a blessing Lord you're able to take the things that are wrong the things that the devil tries to use against us to try to keep us from stepping out and taking you at your word it feels like those things just hang on to us and we feel like we can never break free but Lord I believe you're calling to your bride and to tell them look I I forgive you don't you worry about those things I can make all of those things that are wrong and make it right maybe somebody here just wants to lift their hand and say remember me in prayer those hands everywhere God bless you maybe there's somebody here that wants the Holy Ghost and you're ready to wake up and make a decision of why you're here maybe you want to let that devil know whose side you're really on and that you're tired of being pulled back and forth with every head bout is there's somebody here that would just want to lift their hand up and say I want the Holy Ghost God bless you God bless you we got real needs here tonight somebody here needs a real change going through the motions it's good God's proud of you you've been you've been doing good you've been doing the things that you need to do but something in your heart saying you know there's there's more for you and God's pleased that you're opening up your heart right now why don't you just stand up and receive what God has for you God's dealing with somebody sovereignly [Music] that's God's voice speaking [Music] let the word change you let that desire in your heart then let that Nearness of a spirit that's coming to you right now just just say Lord I'm de-investing from all the things of the world I've gotten so distracted by the things that the Satan wants to offer but Lord I'll I want to deinvest and take all of my thoughts all of my desires all of my ambitions Lord I just want to lay it all down at your feet and I want you to have your will and way at my life as God deals with your heart let's just sing this song there are two roads you may take one by sign one by who take the word of God and what you see what you believe is what we'll be set your wings to The Winds of faith don't let this moment pass you by do you want prayer if you want to kneel at the altar you just you respond to God's word

the word has gone forth that Revelation strikes the heart so water that word in your heart with Thanksgiving and praise and let God continue to move amongst younger let me add my two since What It's Worth to say I believe when we come with Thanksgiving in our heart for answered prayer that God has done it sets the atmosphere for God to do something else for you I think we ought to all be in a
