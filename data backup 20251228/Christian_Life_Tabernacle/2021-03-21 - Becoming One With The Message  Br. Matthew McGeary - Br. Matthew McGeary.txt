lean and bless the lord [Music] oh and then let's just pray heavenly father what a privilege it is to be able to worship you lord in spirit and in truth to serve a living resurrected god not one that's dead and buried in some tomb that an organization would be pointing back to the lord you rose on that third day victorious over death hell in the grave lord you are alive today in each one of your purchased members and we've brought our licks of fire here tonight lord just to worship you to give you praise lord and we're just asking lord once again as you are so merciful to come by our way this morning and break the bread of life and speak to our hearts lord we're so encouraged by that word lord and we're just asking lord that you would come by once again lord help your servant as you know the inability and the weakness that lies here lord if you could move the man out of the way and it would be you to come and that you would speak lord may the people's faith rise up right now lord just to look past a veil lord but to look at the promised word where two or three are gathered in my name there i will be in the midst lord this is what you've ordained man has not ordained this but lord if we can just get man out of the way the supernatural can come and you can have your will and way in the service so we're asking lord for you to break the bread of life now we love you we commit the service to you in the precious name of the lord jesus christ amen praise the lord amen if you can turn in your bibles we'll be reading out of first samuel chapter 3. it's good to see you on a sunday evening amen good things happen in the evening time evening time can be the favorite part of the day and i tell you what it's in the evening time that god has shown forth his great gospel light we're so thankful to be a part of it amen it's reading in first samuel chapter 3 we'll read from verse 1 to 10. it says in the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to waxed him that he could not see and air the lamp of god went out in the temple of the lord where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep that the lord called samuel and he answered here am i and he ran unto eli and said here am i for thou callest me and he said i called not lie down again and he went and lay down and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel rose and went to eli and said here am i for thou should call me and he answered i called not my son lie down again now samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him just a portion of scripture maybe to focus on that samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him little did samuel know what god had in store for his life little did samuel know that he was born a prophet and he was going to be the one that the vision of the lord would come to there was no open vision but now god had brought a prophet on the scene that he was going to bring his word to and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for that is to call me and eli perceived that the lord had called the child therefore eli said unto samuel go lie down and it shall be if he call thee that thou shalt say speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel went and laid down in his place and the lord came and stood and called as other times samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth amen we just asked the lord to bless his word you may be seated i was just in my heart really moved upon that passage as i was reading it this afternoon when the scripture says speak my lord your servant heareth and i believe that is all of our desires that we would hear from the lord amen i believe each one of us may be in our heart this evening if we could just come with that type of attitude and that approach towards the word and we could just say lord speak to me i i'm hearing lord i'm listening to what you would have to say to me this evening no matter whatever however it would come whether it would be cutting whether it would be sharp whether it would be simple and whatever form or whatever way it would be said lord jesus here i am speak to me and i just want to also read from proverbs 29 18 it says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he so just brother branham's going to refer to these two portions of scriptures as he takes this uh thought here and the voice of god in the last days he said it's a very outstanding time we realize that we're speaking from in the scriptures that it said there was no open vision in the days of samuel therefore where there's no vision the bible said the people perish we must have a vision and vision comes to the prophets and it's the word of the lord spoken to them so as we just spoke a little bit on last time how we must have a vision we maybe think to ourselves how can we have a vision but the prophet clearly is showing here that a vision comes to the prophets and it is the word of the lord that is spoken to him and so i'm so thankful that god has given us a vision he requires a vision and now he has given his people a vision here in the end time where the word would say where there is no vision the people perish god has given us a vision and i like to even look at that scripture and maybe a different way it says where there's no vision that people perish i'm so glad that god had a specific vision concerning us what he wanted to do with your life and how he wanted to mold you and how he wanted to shape you that there was a thought and something that he had in his mind a vision and a word that was pertaining to you that god was going to bring in a manifestation in the end time and so maybe it's not always in the way that it it's a good way that we approach it and i've looked at this scripture uh many times and understanding that you know just like in business you need to have a vision you need to have something before you something you're walking after because if you don't have that you're a wanderer you don't have any purpose you you might be tossed to and fro and that word is our vision and just even going in to maybe a deeper depth in my heart as the lord started to move upon me on that scripture is really showing me the vision of the lord for my life and how god has sent a prophet in the end time with a message and it was a specific message to me to teach me how to think to teach me how to act to teach me how to talk to wash me to cleanse me to show me uh the way that that i needed to dress myself and adorn myself in the word because outside of this message there was no open vision that could have been able to have been presented to you to make yourself rapture ready there was nothing that was on the face of the planet that had the ability we could say as the word would say oh in the in time oh there would have been no open vision here the word is calling for perfection it's saying let this mind be in you that's also in christ jesus it was crying out for a rapturing faith to be upon the face of the earth jesus said will i find faith when the son of man comes but oh if if man would have been left in that condition then we would have never been able to meet the challenge of the age but thank god he didn't leave a sealed book he didn't leave us with no vision but no he came with an open book he loosed the seven seals he revealed his very mind to the bride of jesus christ so now we can take this word we can take this and we can feed on it and we can see the vision that he has for our life and the vision that he has for us each and every single day and we can feed upon that and we can walk with that with vision and with purpose knowing that this word is making us rapture ready many of us can maybe just think of our condition i think that's what's amazing about the the the word of god and revelation as god expounds to you and breaks the word of god i mean there's many times i was fellas with brother jackson not too long ago and sometimes you'll read something or hear a quote and the light comes on and you see it in a greater way and you start to wonder like i never saw that i mean really is that where i am but really what it is it's if you've never had the revelation or if you've never experienced it you don't know the condition you're in and many times as we walk with the lord and he reveals his word and a revelation comes down it's not that we were just so low way down here but the word is so great when he brings you up into a higher height oh you could look back down and see where you were and that's what's happening as we walk with with the lord and we believe this word because think of uh some of us i don't know about you but i was out in sin and i thought i was having a good time you know i i thought really that that running out in the town and the things of the world that it had to offer i thought i was having a good time and you know season uh sins is pleasurable for a season but there comes a time where as a son of god look you can look at people in the world and and maybe some of your colleagues and work they can get away with a lot of stuff they can be successful they can get away and you wonder how can they ever get away you're a son of god you were called to manifest that part of the world he makes some vessels to honor and some vessels to dishonor and some people are just running after the things of the world and they're content and they're successful and they're enjoying those things of the world but you weren't called to that and you realize that maybe some of you maybe your testimony maybe isn't that you are so deep in sin and you're so far out there maybe you were a successful person and and business was good and maybe you had nice things but when you come to the revealed word of the hour and you come to a word that starts to sanctify you it starts to cleanse you it starts to change your thinking and as this word brings you up into higher heights it's when you come there that you look back down there and realize how miserable you really were and that's what i love about the word of god and as the as it continues to open up and to draw us into higher heights and maybe just something that's in my heart just even thinking along the lines of of what brother billy was ministering you know that god has given us a pattern in his word and and he so beautifully brought that out just in the prophet moses and thinking of the pattern of the tabernacle the things that he saw in heaven now he had brought them down to earth and everything in the order and all of the law if you start to think about the people who would become unclean god had given the prophet a message or a word that the people if they were obedient to it they could receive the atonement if the people were unclean if you walked over you touched somebody that was dead or walked over a grave or there was the the ordinances and the statutes there and the word well there was a a word where you had to go on the outside of the camp and then the priests would have to come and they'd have to slay a the red heifer and then they would take the blood and then they would uh burn it with i think cedar and hyssop and and scarlet and then they would take the ashes and they'd mix it with the water and then you could go through the stage of purification and then you could come back into the camp but if you were to reject the prophet's message and if you reject the word then you could never come to that place of purification you could never come to the place where you could come back into the camp or back into the fold so there was an order there was a pattern that god had given to his prophet if you were to reject the moses message then you couldn't come back into the camp you were left there in your condition and just thinking along those lines something that struck my heart is i just want to speak to you a little bit this evening on becoming one with the message by god's grace if this can just maybe uh uh uh if the picture can just come forward but you know that we know that you cannot separate the message from the messenger the message and the messenger are one brother branham said the message and the messenger are the same thing they're one in the same and as i thought on those things i started to think about you know brother branham tells a little story there about i believe it was world war one where uh the the armies had gotten in a condition where they were surrounded by the enemy and they're all hunkered down there and and there was no way out and so they needed help they needed another force they needed reinforcements to come in there and be able to get them out of the situation and what they had the only thing the only method that they had to send out word was is they had a little honing pigeon i believe is what they would call it a little messenger bird what they would do is they would attach a little message to that bird now if you were to think about this if you were maybe uh on the sideline and you're watching this uh warren fold and you got this group of men over here that are pinned down and the armies have surrounded and all their guns are on them and they got their artillery over here and they're in a gun battle and all of a sudden this little bird just starts to fly out of the trench there and it starts going off and everybody turns their guns and they start to fire and they're all shooting at this little bird you think what is the threat of this little bird why is a little pigeon causing all of these this military to start shooting their their their their bullets and everything at this little bird that's flying out what what how could this little bear be such a threat but you see that bird was packing a message it was packing a message that could deliver them it was packing a message that would identify their condition and it identified where they were and because that little bird was associated with the message they had become one and so that little bird was just as much as a threat to the enemy as the message and the force that was behind it oh you wonder why the devil wants to attack the prophet you wonder why that antichrist spirit wants to tear down the prophet of the hour oh a little humble simple man out of the hills of kentucky they want to tell what little what threat was he to anybody had no education was just a seventh grade education come out of the hills of kentucky no big homes no big organizations come on somebody didn't pile up money into the banks he didn't have a fleet of cadillac he didn't have a bunch of worldly goods that he could point to oh even in his own heart he got discouraged one time he was looking at oral roberts and billy graham and them and seeing their campaigns and he looked off into the side he said oh my and all i have is a little camper trailer for my office and he felt in his heart a little discouraged but he said oh look up that's where your treasures lie because what was he packing he was packing the message of the hour an end time message that was going to deliver a bribe that was going to bring you out of a lady oh see a condition oh come out from amongst your my people and be not a partaker of your pranks that was the message that he was packing oh and the enemy hates it he hates that little humble prophet why because the message and the messenger are won oh they kept shooting at that little bird but that bird kept on flying and it crashed down into the camp with a message brother branham soul beautifully types that out with jesus christ how he laid down his life for us but i want to say that also now we have a responsibility the messenger has ran his part he has gone off the scene but now there's a people that are packing the message and you are becoming one with the message you're the very light that's shining out into the darkness you are the message you're the manifestation of it you're the very life of it the very word of god uh pulsating in the end time the spirit of god living in a people why oh from faith to faith because god had ordained in the evening time that he'd raise up a prophet according to scripture that would bring forth a message you know many people sympathize with the gospel many times we sympathize with prayer requests we do our best you know i mean we hear it go over the pulpit many times but you know unfortunately we many times forget about it we let it go on and our brothers and sisters are there in that condition laboring and and pleading before god and but i pray that the holy ghost would help us to bind together in christian love but you know many people sympathize with the gospel and uh you know they they they they can maybe try to identify with it you know but i was just thinking about the prayer request and the time of need you know when it comes time for your son when it comes time for your daughter when it comes time for your wife or it puts you into a stage of desperation uh the scene changes a little bit it puts a little more urgency on it it demands a little bit more of your time and your attention you can't just continue on with the things like you normally were doing and act like nothing's going on because now this burden is constantly at you and and your loved one is sick or you have this affliction in your body and i was just even thinking about the time that uh we were there expecting evan to be born there at the home having a home birth you know we we believe the word we know the word and the word says to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover and we believe these things but sometimes it takes a situation or something to arise on the scene to cause a desperation in us where we cry out to god because we come into that need and there that this time it wasn't that i was maybe praying for a brother at another church i wasn't praying for a brother that i'm not so closely or maybe associated with the frequency that we fellowship uh you know and so maybe it didn't have the quite of urgency when i heard the prayer request but now it was in my own home and it was my own wife and it was my own baby boy that was going to be born and if god didn't come off the scene oh i could lose my wife i could lose my baby and it moved me into action where i cried out to god i said oh god lord you said if we lay hands on the sick they shall recover and something rose up i say there was another life form there was another seed it was it was something else on the inside greater is he that is in you than he that is in the wild that laid the hands on my wife and cried forth to the lord and he came on the scene and delivered i wasn't sympathizing in that condition i was in it it was me it was my reality and as i just something that come into my mind as i was thinking about that it i thought about this organization called mad it's a m-a-a-d it's mothers against drunk driving and you know i i've met some uh uh associates along the way and and such a tragic thing and i was just thinking about that though that they they have a uh they have something in common and and when they go through these trials and these hardships in life there's a group now that they feel that they can identify with people that have have lost other their child and and so they can talk to somebody who's been through it before and and maybe they can have helps and certain things kind of set up to help them through that time that they're going through and and so they have this mission statement that they're they're you know mothers against drunk driving and they oh they're wanting to end the drunk driving and in the violent crimes and they want to be a support a system to those uh that have have experienced it and and i thought it most interesting when the thought popped into my mind i thought i would look it up and they have a slogan that says we're heading toward a future with no more victims and i thought my that's certainly an ambitious thought there for them to say that we're heading toward a future with with no more victims but you know that becomes their voice that becomes their message and you know i couldn't be an advocate like they could right i couldn't be on the battlefront the same way they could and if maybe somebody else experienced something as traumatizing as that you know i wouldn't be able maybe to relate to them in the same fashion i wouldn't be able to maybe go out into the programs and maybe to the seminars and be able to give a a a a you know to give a statement or to be a good orator because people would look at me and they'd be like well yes that sounds good and all but what have you experienced what have you been through do you know what you're talking about oh but when one who's been there before when one has experienced it when one of it knows the hurt and the pain and they've been there before oh they can start talking in a way that i could never talk from because they had an experience and i was just thinking about that you know those those helps those things are good you know to to be there but i was just in my mind i was wondering but if if that ever keeps them from coming to you know for them to have that ambitious statement to moving towards the future with no more victims i thought my and that's maybe what they're rally crying what they're believing for and i thought you know for them to have a support group and have something that they're believing in and they have a voice and and they can come together and and maybe have things in common to comfort one another but i thought you know that would be a danger if that's what all they think that they have to comfort them if that's the only thing that they think they have that would be able to to give them comfort because then all that becomes is a broken system it just becomes something to keep them from coming to a source that can truly comfort them and deliver them and just in this little phrase right here i thought we're heading toward a future with no more victims i thought my goodness if that was if that was my message or if that was my heart cry if that's what i was rallying around i only know one thing i only know one gospel that can produce that jesus said if i go and prepare a place for you he said let not your heart be troubled ye believe in god believe also of me in my father's house are many mansions and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and i will receive you unto myself that where i am you may be also oh now you're talking about a promise now you're talking about a place a perfect place calling to you where there is no more victims where there is no more heartache and i love the word how the prophet refers to john 14. he says in that day you will know that i am in the father and the father in me and he says in that day he said that's this day when the revelation is made known oh the revelation has come forth it's no more a sealed book it's no more the vision has been opened you don't have to wait for some future thing to come to give you this type of comfort he said come unto me o ye who are heavy laden and i will give you rest there is a word that has come to you that no matter what condition no matter what situation no matter what heartache no matter what pain we don't want to be chalked up into some system or some way of thinking but we want to give ourselves all to the word of god i'm so thankful that this bible has become a new book i'm so thankful that i can look into it and see the mysteries and i can look into it and know exactly where we're sitting in time what uh what a privilege it is for us brother branham says in identification he says any man who's got a message of god fears nothing that's right any man who got the message of god fears nothing well do you have a message from god yes sir then fear nothing amen little old stephen stand up that morning before the sanhedrin he said why you stiff necks uncircumcised in your hearts and ears you do always resist the holy ghost like your fathers did so do you the bible said his face was like an angel i don't believe it like electric light or something an angel knows where he is standing an angel is scared of nothing he's a messenger from god and any man with god's message knows where he's standing god has a vision for you god has a pattern for you god has a word for you and a message for you and if you receive that message you can stand with no fear like stephen stood you can stand in the face of all adversaries and not waver joshua was a man who had a message and i i like the story i have the scriptures written down maybe if they could put up joshua 14 7-12 maybe just to read the account of it out of the scripture it says 40 years old was i when i when moses the servant of the lord sent me from kadesh barnea to spy out the land and i brought work him word again as it was in my heart nevertheless my brethren that went up with me may the heart of the people melt but i wholly followed the lord my god oh my when everybody else was complaining when everybody else was fussing come on we're not we're not living in the wilderness back there but i don't know about you but i i've i've heard some fussing i've heard some complaining i've heard people that are unsatisfied i hear people that get uncontent hear people walking away from the message and people attacking the message and you hear all kinds of things but no we're we're like we're like caleb here nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart of the people melt that's what some of these brothers are doing now oh yeah they spied out the promised land they believed the message they preached the message they went around the message preaching it but when it came to a time in their life where they realized they couldn't live the message they were lacking something they realized they couldn't take the land and so therefore the land that god had showed them they had to discredit the prophet because they were incapable of taking the land i tell you what if if if if they're saying hey this is the land and this is the vindication and this this is where the people are supposed to be and i realize in my own life i can't be there then i need to discredit the whole thing because if i'm not in there it shows my real colors so i got to start tearing it down and i started start to got to show the the the fallacy in it all right oh many men have have gone up they went up with caleb they spied out the lamb but all their hearts melted before they they couldn't meet the challenge for the age but here caleb standing there said but i followed the lord my god i believe there's young people here sitting this morning that are going to stand if the lord does terry maybe he carries another 10 years maybe he carries another 20 years i don't know he could tarry another 15 years and you might be having to use gadgets and things like that as i was talking to a brother and saying oh a prophet came it was a hundred years ago and and this brother he has this testimony that was with him where is it well he died 40 years ago and he he was an old man when this happened and but no your heart's not going to melt just because you get further and further away from a manifestation of a word back then now you are the manifestation of the word now we can't keep looking backwards we got we can't look back to what god did and keep look looking forward to what he's going to do but realize what he's doing right now and that's you you are the manifested word of the hour you have a message and you must become one with that message amen and moses swore on that day saying surely the land wherein thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance and thy children's forever because thou has holy followed the lord my god and now behold the lord hath kept me alive and he said these forty and five years ever since the lord spake this word unto moses look where he said he spake it to like you mean you're living by another man's word well i got a good pattern right here if i if i read this correctly it says ever since the lord spake this word unto moses while the children of israel wandered in the wilderness and now lo i am this day for score and five years old as yet i am strong this day as i was in that day that moses sent me as my strength was then even so is my strength now to war both to go out and to come in now therefore give me this mountain where the lord spake in that day for thou heardest in that day how the anakims were there and the cities were great and fenced if so be the lord will be with me then i shall be able to drive them out as the lord says i love how he stands or says i'm more able today i'm not a young man anymore i don't have i don't have the strength of my youth anymore when i went over there and i packed the evidence was back over to the children of israel but because the word of the lord set so i'm more able today to perform it just as i was then because he wasn't counting on his own strength he wasn't counting on his own ability the prophet of god said that uh caleb had a trial 45 years or 40-year trial that he that he had to go around there in the wilderness that was his trial but he said because he believed god he possessed the gate of the enemy oh praise god we have a message that we're believing and by believing that message we're possessing the gates of the enemy any man with god's message knows where he was standing he had a message from god and he knew exactly where he's standing he knew he was more than able i was just thinking of something struck my mind as i was just thinking on becoming one with the message and believing the message and i got to thinking about how uh you know many people battle with mental illness and you know if you haven't dealt with people or met people or had friends or families of certain ones that have have dealt with mental illness it's a very a challenging thing and many times they're just being possessed by a spirit some they might call it chemical imbalance they might call it certain things but we know how the devil is he wars against the flesh and it's amazing to me that how these people in that condition they can start to say things and do things and believe things that are so um just impossible but yet they believe it with such a conviction and then you even just look at not to get into the just the evilness that's in the world but people uh they come become possessed possession they take thoughts and they take ideas even uh in the religious realms if you get over there in the middle east people are willing to buy into a religion where they think that strapping a bomb to themself think about it that they're willing to get into a place in their faith or in their belief where they're willing to strap a bomb to themselves and go into a shopping area or go into a downtown area and and kill themselves and try to take as many people with them they they think that they're doing the right thing they they think that what they're doing is truth and i just was thinking upon that and like my if somebody can can get into that type of condition or on the wrong side of things we should be like caleb and be able to get on the right side of things where no matter how impossible it seems because we have received a word that is crazy as it seems to the world if they can sell out themselves and they can die for their message if they can die for what they believe and we're not even willing to to just shape up our lives and to consecrate ourselves and get into prayer we're not even willing to dress better we're not even willing to honor the word of the pastor and honor the word of the prophet we're not even willing to just try to die out for the mess he's not asking you to to strap yourself to a bomb and go to a marketplace he's asking you to dress pleasing he's asking you to say amen to the word he's asking you to consecrate yourself and be in prayer but i wonder the problem is we're not becoming one with the message and so we're leaving part of it out because maybe we don't believe it with the whole heart and god is calling us to a place of total surrender and when we completely die out that no matter what the word says i'm willing to give my all the prophet talks about the condition of the world and how a man has gotten to a place where he says uh a man in a sixth sense as they've got along just fine for so many years but but now they they used to put god into everything here when they wrote the constitution they they put god into everything he says but now after 75 years they don't put god into anything uh they put all their their trust in science and education and put all their trust in politics and oh it's just such a an evil corrupt world that we're living in and the prophet paints this picture just showing how in the evening time and and we know we're living in it a few more years down the road and we i mean my i couldn't even imagine such evil i mean we're hearing things now that 10 years ago i you might not even thought was possible people have lost their minds where they don't know uh they don't even know if they're male or female they they they don't even know uh uh uh what gender they are they don't even know what sex they are they they've totally lost a natural function they they their strong delusions come over them and they've been given over to a reprobate mind and you would think my in the heart of all this in the heart of all this evil and this satan's eden when the condition is so bad yet we're preaching a rugged gospel we're preaching a holiness gospel we're preaching things that seem old-fashioned we're preaching a a a message that seems so radical that if if god would tarry by his grace oh i would like for the church doors to stay open i don't know uh what the future holds but uh we preach something that is so radical to the world that the politics and the social movements and injustice oh if they got a hold and they trained their darts out of sure uh they they would they would turn all of that evil and all that hatred and all that anti-christ hatred on us because what we believe is so radical but i love how the prophet says here in recognizing your day and its message he says but just think right out in the midst of all that and the church denominations and their seminary and lewdness and everything god has took his prophet's word and chopped out a grind he said he would do it he's huge from that thing what he promised he would do he's hewed from that thing what he promised he would do who is that where is it what's he talking about does anybody here know what he's talking about he's talking about the bride of jesus christ he's talking about you and what i love about brother billy preaching this morning is as long as we stay with the pattern if we just stay with the word that word is going to take us right back to where we came from look yes the word says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who thought it not robbery being equal with god yes he's calling for perfection amen but i love ephesians 5 25 where it says husbands love your wives as christ loved the church he goes on to say that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water of the word the prophet said what is it going to take it's going to take a perfect word to get there it's going to take a perfect word producing a perfect bride and that's what this word is doing is it's washing you it's cleansing you it's sanctifying you why because we're going back to where we came from the spiritual amnesia is just slowly uh just getting falling away praise god we've seen the water tower we're walking towards home you know sometimes as the spiritual amnesia's uh are stripping away you see the water tower and all you know to do is walk tell the water tower look if you see the water walk towards the water tower i'm reminded of the story of brother branham one time he he got in the death march he was up there on the mountain and the storm blew in and he didn't know how how he was gonna find his way and his wife and and kid was down there at the end of the mountain there in a little cabin and he got on the little death march they call it and he realized he was lost oh all of us in the same condition we were lost we we didn't know where we were going we didn't even know how to to save our own selves but the lord started to deal with this prophet he said oh god forgive your stupid servant he realized he got himself up there and he got him lost and now everything that he held there to was at the bottom of that mountain and he he he he said i am an ever present help in the time of trouble and he just thought oh that was just maybe that was just uh my own thinking he kept he kept walking the lord spoke to him again i am the lord god i'm an ever present help in the time of trouble and all he realized that god was speaking to his heart and he said a hand come on his shoulder and turned them and as it turned him around also all the clouds and everything parted and he saw the tower up on the mountain and he had actually hung the wire from that tower down to the cabin giving an electrician electricity so he knew that all if he just walked this way oh he said i was walking clear into canada i was walking to certain death and the weather was going to be so cold no no doubt my own family would have died oh we were all in that condition we were walking to certain death but oh god rich and mercy he put his hand on your life and turned you around and he parted on the clouds and he said this way go this way this is the way and now we're just walking with our hands up praising god thanking god just walking towards calvary thank you lord jesus just keep your hands up all the way and he says oh i walked a little bit also i caught the line [Music] hallelujah oh you might not have it all figured out you might not be able to see around every little bin you might not be able to say this look over here but i say oh god if you've seen the tower if the clouds have been parted just keep walking towards calvary with your hands up just giving them praise and he'll lead you every step of the way maybe just to turn a little corner here i want to read out of first samuel chapter 13. we won't be much longer we won't be much longer all right y'all get ready first samuel 13 8. says and he carried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed so now we have an open vision if you will here's the prophet samuel he has now given a word of the lord and maybe just to give a little background to this um uh you know the the children of israel were complaining and they wanted a king and so god uh sought out saul to be king and now as he was going along his way there after his father's donkeys that were lost saul was going through the mountainside of the countryside looking for some donkeys for his father and saw uh samuel meets him out there and says hey uh god has chosen you to be king and he's like me a benjamite i'm the least in the house of israel and so samuel now starts to tell saul everything that's going to happen he starts to tell him look when you depart from here the spirit of the lord is going to come upon you you're going to see these two guys over here they're going to have the donkeys when you get up here the prophets are going to be there and then i want you to come back over this place and i want you to wait for the appointed time and i'm going to come meet you and i'm going to offer a sacrifice unto the lord so now the prophet has received the word of the lord and now he has delivered his message to saul and now saul is walking in the vision now saul is walking in the word that has been given to him and everything is unfolding exactly as the prophet said it would amen and so now and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgai and gilgal and the people were scattered from him so they were i believe they were in a battle with the philistines they got in a little place where the people had been scattered but now according to the appointed time samuel is going to come and meet saul as he said he would and offer a sacrifice and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and a peace offering and he offered the burnt offering and it came to pass that as soon as he made an end of the offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and samuel said what hast thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me and that thou camest not within the days appointed well you just read it said right after he was done he the prophet showed up so he got a little hasty he said when i saw that they came in with not in the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together at mcmaster look at he starts to justify the word here the prophet of god told him look if you just this is everything that's going to happen and now after seven days i'm going to meet you and i'm going to offer a sacrifice i'm going to come to you and i will offer the sacrifice but it was in the waiting and the terry and for that word to come to manifestation that saul got a little hasty and he offered the sacrifice and he broke the word of the lord and it was for that reason that the prophet says to him look if you if you would not have uh disobeyed the word of the lord i would have established your kingdom forever but but now god has sought him out a man after his own heart and i just was thinking i'm on this and and even after this god is is gracious to keep saul he's still uh uh the k uh the king over the kingdom and and now he remembers what the amalekites had done uh to the children of israel and so he says you know what i want you to go into the amalekites i want you to kill every single one of them so he gives them the word of the lord and he goes down there and sure enough he comes back and he has this great victory he killed them all but he brings the king with them and and and there's all these uh uh rams and sheep and everything he's breathing but he spoiled but when when the prophet told him look when you go down there i want you to kill every woman every child every person every ram every sheep every goat wipe the whole place out but somewhere along the line in the in the line of duty saul started to reason with the word of god and so now what does he do he starts to justify his actions and now he's coming back and what's most amazing about that story is he comes back and and samuel says to him he says why why have you transgressed the word of the lord and him staring the prophet in the face says what are you talking about i fulfilled all that you commanded me to fulfill and he says what meaneth me the bleeding of these sheep and i feel oh god so many times in my life as i'm staring into the gospel and i'm staring into the bible and i'm listening to the message i wonder if there would be a a a voice come back and say what meaneth the bleeding of these sheep we say that we're fulfilling the word of god we say we believe all that the message says but we're not fulfilling the message because we're not becoming one with the message we must become one with the message that the very things that were spoken are being lived out through us so now the message is no longer in letter form but it's now living and in action in a people and so the very oh when the prophet of god says if you got a tv kick it out of your house there has to be a manifestation of that word it can't stay in the books and as time goes on we realize that oh okay uh we're not ignorant of satan's devices and so we have to have a spiritual discernment to realize how satan tries to creep into our lives and he tries to orchestrate entertainment he strives to orchestrate technology in such a way where we're still not honoring the word of god and so i pray that by the holy ghost in our lives that we could take the word and it would be interpreted into our lives and not a justification well you know i mean uh um you know he said a tv and i don't have a tv i have a monitor i mean look at church what's that they got a church god's one why can't i have one well look you if you want to justify and make all the excuses you want go right ahead but the word of god is telling you that you're making excuses you're being a soul and if you want to get rapture ready if you want to be adorned with the word and put on the whole armor of god then the word of the lord is continuing to come over the pulpit your pastor stands up here and he he speaks on these things on social media and how to dress and how to act why because it's the same word of god that was in the prophet it's the same word of god that's in the ministry that's now living in a people and we want to be faithful to manifest every word that was spoken it says there in first samuel says samuel didn't one let one word fall to the ground and i pray as the bride of jesus christ we're not going to let one word fall to the ground oh yeah you saw saul got weary and well doing if he would have just waited a little bit longer if he could have just waited just a little bit longer but it's many time in the waiting just like the scripture says though at terry wait for it it shall speak amen we'll just look for a little spot here to finish up i just appreciate the y'all's attentiveness this evening he said this he said to saul look just just go there and wait for the appointed time and it reminds me of there in the new testament when jesus told his disciples he said go ye there and tarry in jerusalem and wait until you're endued with power on high he's the same god tonight as he was then and what did they do they went and tarried there and the holy spirit was poured out and they were filled with the holy ghost they'd come out the windows and they come out the door said they said oh you y'all are drunk said men and brethren these are not drunk as you suppose but this is that which was promised by the prophet joel that i'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh is he the same yesterday today and forever i say he's the same god here tonight and i want to surrender myself i want to give myself holy over to him into that word just reading this quote and closing if the musicians would come recognizing your day in its message he says israel is back in her promised land she don't know how she got back there she was just automatically put back there why national force put her in her place now i'm going to say something national force put israel in her homeland national forest will put the church in the world council of churches but the power of god will put the people in the bride the world forces this way and the world forces that way but god forces upward the spirit of god which is the word of god my spirit my word is spirit and life will put the bride in her place because she'll recognize her position in the word then she's in christ we'll put her in her place no national force will do it now listen here no national force will do it but the national force did drive israel to the homeland the national forces of the council of churches will drive ever every organization into it but the power of god will raise the bride into glory out of it and something just struck my heart you know many times maybe you've heard it preached that way but many times we're looking for church doors to be shut down we're looking for the squeeze to come down we're looking for our brothers and sisters to be running down the street for what they believe and people shooting them in the back and we're looking for some some great calamity and if we're not careful we start to get a religious ideal like the churches have for the coming of the lord that some 900-foot jesus has to come down and we start in our mind thinking of some apocalypse that has to happen where we're all scattered and people are running and i don't know those things might happen but those are not the things that are going to put you in the rapture those are not the things that are going to make you perfect there's only one thing that's going to make you perfect and that is the word of god and the word out god has come it's been loosed it's been revealed it is here you're feeding on it that's the thing that's going to make you perfect it's not going to be some world council of the churches it's not going to be some squeeze coming down oh but it's going to be the power of god that's going to raise the bride of jesus christ into glory hallelujah i'm so thankful for that i don't have to look for some uh organizational movement i don't have to be looking for some world council of churches to tighten up i don't have to be looking for some national force i don't have to look for the national guard to start walking down through bedford and hunting me out and say you you believe in william branham i'm going to shoot you in the back and all of a sudden i'm like okay this is what i've been looking for the whole time i'm going to finally get rapture in faith i'm finally gonna be perfect because somebody's pointing a gun at you no it's not gonna be somebody pointing a gun at you you're gonna have rapturing faith because rapturing faith is already inside of you and the prophet came to reveal to you that you're going back to god where you came from hallelujah let's stand [Music] oh we got to become one with the message hallelujah i say are you hearing the message are you becoming one with the message i say say what he said say what he said the scripture says if you walk in the light as he is in light we have fellowship one with another and the blood of jesus christ his son cleanses us from all sin now the holy ghost is here the fullness of the word is here to perform in you the vision he had in his mind from the very beginning you don't have to wait for something way off in the future he's given you his vision he's given you his mind which is this word and now as we feed on it we become it we become one with the message listen to this now this is the prophet's word he says so how can how can you do it through anything else right we just said that the blood of jesus christ cleanses us from all sins says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus be there for even as your heavenly father is perfect so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of god which is the waters of separation that washes us from all sin from our sin amen that's right the blood of jesus christ think of it the dripping bloody word oh people people get hung up on the mercy seat is he on the mercy seat is the officer i don't care wherever you want to put him but i've received the bloody dripping word that's cleansing me that's sanctifying me that's justifying me that's filling me with his holy spirit there's nothing else that's going to be able to do it but this way and what is this word doing now i want you to hear i want you to become one with this message amen [Music] amen the blood the word of god bleeding blood to wash the bride and amen yes sir she stands perfect i know we've heard it over and over but i i can't get i can't get tired of it i need to hear it over and over and over oh i love to hear who i am in christ the devil tells me who i am enough outside of christ he wants to try to remind me of my faults and failures he wants to try to attempt this sticky nature he wants to put thoughts into my head and tell me i thought him he wants to build nests up there he wants to try to run me down because what he doesn't want you to do is come to really know who you are and when you do what does he say the rapture will go realizing that this message is telling you who you are and it's saying you're perfect now we need to believe that she stands perfect virgin unadulterated she never sinned in the first place amen oh man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god now i want to ask you who said that god said that and if caleb can hang on a word from the prophet moses to when he was 85 years old to go up and possess a natural hand how much more can we receive a word from a vindicated prophet that you're perfect you're sinless you never did it in the first place oh i like this just ending on this scripture [Music] paul says but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake as a child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face if i could say it like this when you're looking into a mirror in the dark you can you can't really make out what's in there you can maybe see some characteristics and maybe you could look in there like well i think that's me maybe that's me but when you're looking into that mirror in the dark oh you you really can't see what's going on he's saying though he looked through a glass darkly but then face to face i was just thinking about that how the word that says in in zechariah 14 7 says but it shall be a day which which be known to the lord not day nor night but it shall come to pass that in the evening time it shall be light and to me as i was looking at this scripture i saw myself standing there looking at the bible it's a mirror but i couldn't make it out it wasn't an open vision i couldn't see who i was i couldn't figure it out oh but then when the light of the message turned on the light it became an open book and i said mama that's me that's me that's me in there oh and you become one with the vision hallelujah let's sing this song oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] myself [Music] to say this here brother billy read this quote he says out of the identified christ of all ages so you see the whole thing is god becoming tangible that's you god became tangible and a prophet it was the word made flesh now through that prophet the word has been spoken now the word that has been spoken is being tangible it's becoming flesh in you that on that great day that's to come when christ sets upon the throne of david and reigns in a million it's god tangible in earth he is he is now in you you are his attributes if you've got eternal life your life always was and you was god's thinking the color of hair whatever you are you was god's thinking and you're just materialized and i was just thinking about that you're just materialized something that he always had in his mind you were a part of him you were back there in that logos but something that's been materialized and and i was i was thinking on this i got to thinking about the vision of the prophet you know one time there was a family oh maybe they had raised their little boy they raised them right and they were driving down the road maybe one day and there was a great accident and he was laying there on the road dead could you imagine how heart stricken how how what a desperate situation that would be and you know if time would go on he would just be another statistic but little did that family know that there was a prophet halfway around the world who had had a vision and in that vision there was a boy laying that had been struck by a car and was laying on the on the street dead but now this was a vision it hadn't happened yet but this was a vision that god had given us profit but then there came an hour in a time where that vision was materialized oh and oh boy if it wasn't been for the word of the lord and if it hadn't been for an open vision that boy would have just been another statistic but he was part of the vision and he could come there and he said the rest of us just drama now because that little boy was part of the vision it was thus saith the lord that he would come to life it was that vision becoming material and that was just a little way god dealt with my heart of trying to understand the mind of god just as he would show him a vision there of something that would happen in the future that's the same thing with you and that says eternal as god is eternal the more that i [Music] surrendered [Music] [Applause] more [Music] sure [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] every day [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh oh oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] oh [Music] oh i knew [Music] [Music] me for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] i was all i could see [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] [Music] come on [Applause] when i heard [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] oh me is in the word of god wonderful amen amen how many see the vision amen we heard and we see the vision we read our bibles all we could see the vision we read the message all we could see is the vision amen i pray that there's god just walk us into that vision so we can become one with it whatever it takes i want to be one with my vision whatever you had installed oh that's all i desire nothing more nothing less because this is walking you into perfection this is the word of god you know not by power not by might but by my spirit his spirit is send his word and his spirit is here to perfect the people i like that quote that brother matthew read it's not it's not the forces outside that's going to change us no those things are just bringing us closer together but the real power lies in the word the real power lies in the word you receive the word you receive power you receive the word you receive the power to change things amen what's so wonderful let's just buy heads tonight our gracious father we just thank you lord once again for your word lord god and we heard our brother just speak to us lord about this vision and about this coming one with you lord and father surely it's our desire to become one with you lord and father we know that you

desired a transformation in my own heart and i pray that for each one whose message they're going to hear this message father that you bring that transformation that closeness of walking with you lord
