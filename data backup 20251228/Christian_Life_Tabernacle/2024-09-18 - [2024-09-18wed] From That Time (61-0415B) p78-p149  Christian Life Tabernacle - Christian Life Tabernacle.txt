guess we had quite the traffic uh coming in tonight some accidents uh um going on out there people banging into each other you know uh we just every time you hear about accidents just pray that nobody gets hurt and then pray that brother Daniel ends up with the car in his shop so that that's the only things that we can have happen up I want to uh just make a couple little announcements uh about what's coming up uh this Sunday brother Ron Peterson will be with us from Phoenix Arizona he'll be having our services this Sunday I believe that's uh what is this Sunday the 20 uh 20th is it the 20th or anyway so and then the following Sunday uh uh we're going to have a special Sunday uh brother we're going to have brother Cosman speak for us in the morning and I'm trying to talk his father into speaking uh in the evening so cosbin can interpret for and then next not this coming Sunday but the following Sunday then after the evening service we're going to have a little get together uh in the room over there kind of a way for us to say goodbye to brother Cosman before he heads out to uh Romania and then on the 6th of October uh brother George Smith uh will be here with us for a couple services and then the following uh Sunday uh my that's the weekend of my mom's Memorial so andless birthday on the 12th so we'll be gone that weekend and then we'll be back for the 20th and then uh right after the 20th the following Sunday is a real important Sunday it's the it's the 27th of October anyway that'll be my 75th birthday so I'm gonna throw a party for myself we'll have a Sunday morning service and then Sunday evening we'll have something to eat over in the room over there so we'll do that and then don't forget our meetings are coming up November 8th 9th and 10th November 8th 9th and 10th so that's going to be our annual meeting and also our dedication meeting so uh we just trust everything will work well I think for our youth meeting we put a little over 550 people in the building building so uh we'll have just to get close to one another again and and squeeze together and then uh if we have overflow then we'll we'll make room for our overflow so we're certainly looking forward to that uh this evening I want to play a a a a small portion of a tape but um when when I hear brother Brandon preach a message uh and then he'll Maybe preached that message four or five different times just the fact that he approaches it more and once makes me take heed to it that there's something lying within there some sort of thought uh uh maybe even beyond the thought i' like to consider a principle and um something that a a a principle is something by which something operates in other words it it operates on these principles um like maybe it'll operate on the principle of of gravity or you know maybe if you had we flowing liquid down you have the the gravity it has a principle behind it and there are certain principles in our lives as Christians that are P that is important to us that we understand them because it's how things work one of the great uh principles of Christianity is uh is repentance and uh uh if you don't have that uh down then a lot of things don't work you know it's the it's the it's a principle you know what I mean you can't go forward if you have a in your heart against somebody you got to make that right that's a principle and so what you'll find out is you have a lot of vain efforts that never amount to nothing until everything gets back on track and so this is the a a a statement that has motivated me for the approach that I've taken and the things that are on my heart to share with you and our Prophet has said this he said I want to speak to you something to bring something to Enlighten you to the promises of God for this age so uh that's another thing that we got to a principle that the church operates on is that we're operating in an age like no other age this is a time like no other time uh and there is a word for this age age that was never given in any other age so like our messenger told us it was a principle he said Noah's message won't work in this day Moses's message won't work in this day so that's a principle that you can look back into the gospel you can look back into the history of the Bible you can look back at the Bible characters but you've got to understand that you have a special word for your day you have a special challenge for your day the enemy uh attacks you in a special way for this day you know you think of of uh uh of uh technology and things uh it it so amazing what people what we have to deal with I mean just uh the other day there's a quite a story in the news because uh I guess Israel they set up a a a a a a a tremendous plan so they went and and they they put a rumor out that uh they had infiltrated all the cell phones and uh of the their enemy so their enemy went out and bought pagers so they could avoid being detected well Israel sold them the pagers I just it's so elaborate that it I don't I I just got to say it sometimes you wonder if God's in it you know what I mean that they could pull this off and then they blew up all the pagers they got a message and the pagers exploded so they went to an emergency system of walkie-talkies and they able to blow them up now I carry around the phone and I wondering can they blow these things up you know they want to put you in a car they can stop you know what I mean I mean in other words the only Freedom we have is in Christ Jesus and if there's ever a time that we need the leadership of the Holy Spirit on the things that we do it's now amen and so as we go on brother BR said he said he said something not something that somebody else was in some other day so we're not trying to go back and be what somebody else was in another day that was the failure of Pentecost they they wanted to be like the apostles they wanted to be like they were in the other day they had to get everything trying to get it back to the day of Pentecost to the the early church but we have another faith we have the Faith of Our Fathers which was in the faith in the word of the hour that they lived in and so that's a different measure than reading a Bible story and so brother B's pointing that out as a principle he says we don't want he says you know that somebody else was in some other day but something then the things are all right and we refer to those things but I thought I would try to bring something to your mind with the scriptures I've got written here that would Enlighten you to know and make you a better soldier in the field that you're fighting in now so that's why that I want to play this tape this evening and make comments on it so you can be a builder Soldier I can be a better Soldier we can be a better soldier in the field that we're in now and then we can understand a principle by which things operate and if we can live by that principle it'll bring us much Victory he says he says to that you're fighting in now to learn the tactics of the enemy okay and the prophet of God's going to mention things in here here and I think you'll be able to see the tactics of the enemy so that you can block everything before it gets to you see that's the main thing is to learn to keep the punches off of you as much as you can so we're we're going to listen uh if you have uh one of your tablet or phone or whatever you want uh we're going to listen to uh a portion of tape about 27 minutes uh from the sermon that brother Brandon preached called from that time and this is the one in Bloomington um Illinois and I believe it's 52061 and uh so we're going to start with the reading of the scripture and uh we'll just listen to the 27 minutes and then I just want to make a few comments at the end and um I I also want you to notice uh just how sweet brother brandom's spirit is in this tape and how understanding he is and how loving he is and uh it that really touched me so let's stand together and and uh we'll uh we'll open our Bibles for the Short scripture reading is found in Matthew the 4th chapter and the 17th verse brother bram's going to read it and then um after he's done reading uh you can take your seats and um and just enjoy and and soak it in and just um meditate on it and uh and then we'll try to make a comment or two uh to um just try to help this sink in a little deeper so let us pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we're not even worthy to be in your presence but yet you're so kind and merciful to us Lord we don't know what we'd have done if you hadn't in your great wisdom stored up spiritual food in due season father that in this Great Famine that we live in in a land that's turned their hearts from you that we would have an eternal source of pure Vindicated word Lord that we know beyond the shadow of a doubt we can put our full confidence in and our full faith in and we don't have to figure it out we don't have to understand it we can believe it with all our hearts knowing that you will interpret it and you will bring it to pass just exactly the way it is spoken and we rest in that Bless the people tonight father as we felt led to play this portion of tape I ask that you would bless it to their hearts in Jesus name we pray amen God bless you our messenger in the Book of Matthew the 4th chapter the 17th verse we we read these words and from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand I'm going to take the little subject watch that clock the subject of from that time now there is uh times that we can say from that time there's times when as a young child these ministers here could say I was at a church and uh or I was out in the field or I was reading the Bible and from that time a little boy an old man we have a certain time that something happens and then we say from that time the little boy can say you know I I never lied in my life and one day I made a corn silk cigarette and I got up behind the old fire chimney and and I smoked this cigarette and got some coffee and put my mouth so Mama wouldn't smell it and and uh she said Junior have you been smoking a red light don't lie little boy don't lie conscience don't lie no Mommy you broke every barrier then and from that time I begin to lie that's way we start we have to mark it from some time something happened and from that time it changed things we all have those kind of times the immoral woman walks on the street she might have said one time I was as pure as a Lily and as radiant as after the rain when the Heavenly dude fell upon me and I was as pure as that Lily I was out with a boy that I thought to be a gentleman one night he gave me a spiked Coke he kissed me in a way that he should not have kissed me instead of pulling away from him and slapping him in the face and going home I throw my s into his arms and from that time there always something then I throw my life away I talked to such a woman the other day they had her in a psychic Ward I went in to pray for he said go back in straight jackets that's really what last night would have been the Visions were going right along calling those people from CS and things but when the glory of God fell in that building I couldn't even hear no more you know why I sent them ministers down there I want this audience to know and these people to know when I leave here that they don't have to send for me to pray for them I wanted the people to know that these Servants of God can lay their hands on the Seck it ain't nothing to one person it's we are a group of people we are a family of God going into this emergency room there was a beautiful young woman sitting there great brown eyes and dark hair she looked like she'd been a queen for any man's Palace how do you do she said how do you do brother brand I looked around and there there was in straight jackets and screaming and cursing and uh woman using the bed pan and whitting her face in it excuse that for after eating your breakfast but just insanity and there's what your faith has when you preach Divine Healing I said well I just don't know where to start first and the young lady said I wish you would start with me first if you don't I said you're not a patient she said yes sir I said well uh what's the matter she said Mr Brandon I was raised in a Christian home I was raised to honor God she said one time I got out with a boy my mother and father warned me not to go with such a boy but said he was cute he had you know hair pretty and oh of course that's that's all right sure and I don't blame any woman look your best and whatever be clean and La that's all right but I just hate to see somebody disfigure thems these women don't even look like a human see uh but look clean be like a lady and man don't be sloppy that's not humble that's dirty see be clean but don't try to you know it's just don't try to do things like that just be just ordinary brother you see and just just be yourself I hate to see anybody try to put on something that they're really not excuse me for leaving the subject a minute I was down in Florida and somebody said I down there to help this little preacher David Little David years ago and uh he got in a tight place down there and I went down to help him so we had the lord gave us a great crowd out there and so many people I couldn't visit them all so one of them said The Duchess wants to see you I said the who I never heard of such a name said The Duchess I said said well what's that said it's a woman owns all this estate to here she let us put this thing here I said well just look at the hundreds of sick people out there trying to see me too to pray for them I said is she sick said no she just wants to talk with you a while oh I said if I got any time let me spend it with those people there that really need it well they had her around behind the steps of the tent where come down I I I hope I'm not saying anything evil great big woman standing there with enough jewelry on her hands to to sponsor a missionary 10 times around the world stand there and she had a pair of specs glasses on a stick and hold it out like that now you know and I know that you're not going to look through any glasses out like that the see but what was it putting on the dog and she looked through there she said are you Dr brandom I said no man I said I'm brother bandam she reached her harm way out like this and she said I am Charmed to meet you I reach got a hold of that big fat hand I said get it down here so I'll know you want to see you again see like that uh I see now what was it she was just trying to be something that she wasn't what are you anyhow six foot of dirt that's all just a little name of Duchess or doctor PhD or lld that has nothing to do with is your creature of time on the earth now this young lady I said to her what happened she said well a boy this boy smoked and said he tried to get me smoking I wouldn't do it and said one night he give me a piece of candy that had been documented Spanish Fly you vet here doctors know what that means so she said it got me on the wrong road she said then I I eat this candy thinking it was all right she said I don't know what happened till the next day and my mors as a young lady was ruined and she said then I thought what's the difference I started drinking she said I join church I did everything I know how to do and she said then finally I served a time at the good Shepherd's home in the Catholic institution and I Jared the Catholic Church thought that would help me didn't do it when to come out done the same thing said as a street walker prostitute said a drunk alcoholic and said then when I quit that said they picked me up again I served two years in woman's Penitentiary and said when I come out of there I Jared another church and said didn't do a bit of good and she said and I heard about your meetings I thought I'd come down and see if you could help me I looked at her a beautiful I thought what wouldn't that be a queen for some little tired evangelist coming in from the field wore out the sweet little wife put her arms around him and said darling I know you're tired you don't know what that does to you you do when times you're going this no one can take the touch of a real sweet wife right if God could have given a man something better he had done it I thought what a sweet little thing she could be I said I want to ask you something didn't you never in your life ever feel like at uh you'd like to have a hubby and have little babies and be like she said sure Mr Brandon she said that' be the desire of my heart well a woman can't think that and be too far off the line and she said but who would have me she said I you just I I wouldn't even speak before a minister the dirty low down things that I've done and yet young woman maybe 20 and I said well uh can we pray and she said yes I got out I said I want you to pray and you asked God to forgive you of these things and she said I've done that so many times times it don't work I said well try it again she got out she prayed she got back up she said now brother brandom says I'm turning a new page tonight I said yep turn it back again tomorrow I said that won't work and she said U I said I want to ask you something you don't want to do those things do you honey and she said no I don't and I said this may seem oldfashioned as it could be but I said you might join every church every Methodist Baptist Catholic and all and you'll have be the same thing I said it's a devil those big bright eyes looked up to me and she said Mr brandom I've always believed that said something drove me to do things that I don't want to do I said that's a demon a devil power and she said I've always believed it so I said you pray again she got down and prayed she looked over at me again I prayed for her and laid hands on her and um so she lay there a little while and she looked back she said you think it's over I said just keep on praying well she prayed a while longer I was taking plenty of time with her just she got the case over after a while she struck fire when she did she raised up them eyes a change she said Something's Happened said now it's old you don't have jarn nothing now sister she's married and got children no more drinking Rosella you here Rosella Griffin the alcoholic she was something on that order how many knows Rosella many of you Rosella there you are from that time a certain thing then from that time it changed that's what the immoral woman the drunk could say I was raised as a provisionist my people didn't believe in drinking but one time I was with some boys and they call me a if I didn't take a drink and and I took my first drink and from that time that's the time it started one night in a in a Roadhouse one night parked on the side of the road when my girlfriend give me a drink from that time it's started New Year's they turn a new page good intention don't do no good that won't help anything I used to see my father throw away his chewing tobacco on on New Year's and say I'll never chew it no more and watch where he thr it so I can pick it up the next day you see and I've see him throw his bottle away and then watch what he done with it you see go you you turnning Pages don't do no good it takes something to happen inside any doctor will tell you if you put something on the outside and heal was sore over on the outside it'll only make it worse if it isn't it has to heal from the inside out and that's way Christianity is isn't jarn in church or something it's healing from the inside coming out your conversion comes from the inside inside the core the spirit life after the first world war many of you young fellas don't remember this us older man remembered I was just a boy nine years old but I remember they said we'll have no more Wars after the first world war it's all settled they found a thing called gas and we we just can't we will never be able to to survive Another War because that it's uh uh we're going to fix an idea that we'll never have no more Wars that's all we're settl it for good so but they had other War they find they finally organized the thing called the U I believe it was called the League of Nations and we're going to take so many soldiers out of every nation and we're going to have a police guard and if anybody gets out of roof one of this so many out this nation so many we're going to go say sit down John because the nations are just a bunch of boys just a family that's all there is do it like a house to God and we're going to police them and we're going to have the League of Nations but they had War just the same now they've got the UN but we got War just the same you see so uh when we formed the UN and we get all the nations into it now Russia's out and this and that see there's none of those things you you can't put your hands on that not a thing the young couple one time there was a young couple would get married and the young couple might have said um John and Mary and how fine they live together and they might have said that I am perhaps maybe I'm taking too long and holding this uh meeting too long what time we have to leave brother what time oh I didn't know we're sorry brother just a few minutes and we yes sir thank you sir we didn't know that we're supposed to have left the 10 let's go just a little farther it was fine and dandy told one time a little curly-headed salesman come in that talked her into something wrong and it broke off her home from that time you see brother brandom you're telling us this morning of how many things that's happened and what's taking place and all this that and the other is there anything that can happen that stands eternally yes when a man meets God there was a man named Abraham just an ordinary man but one day he met God and from that time he was changed forever he believed something that he could not see when he met God he was changed Moses a runaway servant he didn't he was supposed to deliver the children of Israel but he run away and he didn't know how to do it his military training wouldn't let do it but one day he met God he was a changed man and a man meets God it makes him act different than he ever did act could you imagine a Moses how ridiculous when you meet God what it'll make you act Billy did you say we had 10 minutes about 10 minutes sorry uh how make look at Moses here one day he's a sheep herder a prince of Egypt run away on the backs side of the desert back on the backside of the desert herd and sheep afraid to go to Israel uh go down to Egypt rather and here he is on the backs side of the desert the next morning here he is with his wife sitting straddle a mule with a young on her hip Whiskers hanging this low 80 years old his bald head shining a stick in his hand here he goes glory to God hallelujah walking where you going Moses going down to Egypt to take over one man Invasion why he had met God where he was was running now he was going back to take over and he done it because he had met God and from that time The Burning Bush Moses was a different character after he met God that's right Mary the little virgin never had a woman bore a child without being uh an interourse with man never had she never been able to to ever be able to have a child without natural pollen but she believed God and before she felt any life or anything else the Angel's word was good enough for her she met the Lord said Hail Mary blessed art thou amongst women you're going to have a child knowing no man she said behold the hands made of the Lord and from that time Mary never waited till she was positive why would we wait till we were we've got to see our hand come straight our foot come straight the belly ain't stopped not her the angel of the Lord his message is good enough for her she SC around testifying Hallelujah and going to have the baby knowing no man why she met God that was a different Peter when he met God and Jesus revealed to him who he was from that time he was an apostle Paul the Little Hook noosed Jew sarcastic going down there with a letter in his pocket to arrest all them people Shout speaking in tongues he was going to put him in jail he had a a order from the high Church to do it but he met God from that time oh he was a different man when he met God one time a dirty stinking leper laid at the gate and Jesus came through and he said if thou wilt thou can make me clean from that time he had no leprosy why he met God that's that an immoral woman met God God one time at the well she had five husbands and lived with the six he told her the very secret of her heart and from that time she was a messenger of God to the city come see a man who told me what I've done isn't this the very Messiah Hallelujah when you meet God it changes things from that time it changes things it certainly does it does it for all people there was a blind man one time met God and from that time he could see certainly as soon as he met God now we got a lot more we could say but to hurry I want to make one statement here death met God one time and it never was the same Afters the devil always doubted that being the Son of God he thought if that was him up there on a mountain why didn't he perform a miracle before me when they tuck him down there and put that rag around his eyes and hit him on the head and said if you are a prophet if you can discern the thoughts of the heart now you tell us who hit you we'll believe you they thought surely that can't be God they let somebody pull the beard out of his face and haw with drunken spit of a soldier and spit in his face and that be God and then stand there and not say a word about it said that couldn't be God God to Smite him dead see he just don't know the nature of God a lot of people try to be I'm so and so step out like that that's not God the way down is up his humility proved to me he was God what he was humble sweet now the devil thought that wasn't god let's take a look at him just as we were watching watch how death met him and what happened to death how could that be God being a man why he was born down there out of holy wedlock his mother probably had that baby but Joseph this old man 45 years old her 16 why he is a father of four or five children and then go ahead and marry this young girl why that baby is born without a holy wedlock that's how they had to turn that's exactly the way the people believed it born under without a holy wedlock they believe that illegitimate child how could that be God it could couldn't be God so I see going up the hill let's let's go to Jerusalem for the next 3 minutes or five I we're talking I hear a noise let's go look out the window raise it up I hear something going bump bump bump it's an old cross coming up the street he had one garment on his back wall through out without a scene a howling mob I see a little woman run out in front and say what has he done but heal your sick make gentleman out of your criminals what has he done but brought us hopes of Life a big rough hand smacked her across the street said would you listen to that woman instead of your Bishop your priest what's he done I look at him he's little across Dragon I see some little red spots on on the back of his coat that's got across his shoulder what are they on up the hill he goes and spots begin to come bigger and bigger larger natur while they all run into one big spot Splash now it's blood dragging the footprints out as it comes up I can see the bee of death say you want me to go now Satan yeah ah he that's not God he's not even a prophet you wouldn't stand that he'd curse that bunch of people if he was a prophet he that's out him go on bee stinging anchor him we've got him now and see that bee of death begin to hum around him Buzz around him brother anybody knows an insect that has a stinger like a bee if it ever stings deep it don't have no Stinger no more he stuck his sting in the wrong flesh then he stuck it in Emmanuel's flesh the bee of death stung him death met God since then he don't have any Stinger he pulled his flesh he depowered him he couldn't sting no more one named Paul when they were building a a place of scaffold there in Rome to chop his head off that bee be to hum around him make a noise said oh death where is your stinger grave where is your Victory but thanks be to God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ and when death met God God pulled the stinger out of death something happened to death when it met God and today when we go to face him death can buz but it can't sting it hasn't got any Stinger let us pray father I'm so glad that death has no Stinger it can fuss Buzz around and try to make us as scared we can stand like Paul of old we've had that same experience that we have passed from Death because we've been hid in a body called Jesus Christ that pull the very Stinger of death out of it so we have the muddy grave can no longer hold a Believer for he rose again and as he rose We rise with him for those that are dead in Christ will God bring with him at his coming God is if there's someone here this morning who has never met Christ as I would like to have spoke of it may they meet him this morning and their lives will be change from now on granted Lord now we ask that you would bless these lovely women that helped us in this this institution all this Methodist College here all their courtesy of letting us have this room God I pray that young men coming from here will be real missionaries and man of God grant it Lord May something be done or said that'll turn their hearts so to God that there'll be real uh second John Wesley's come out of here God grant it Bless The deans and all bless us together bless the services tonight and the oncoming Services bless our ministering Brethren here and all this gathered together and we'll praise thee through this Our Time and Eternity we ask in Jesus name amen don't forget the sister's tips on the table if you will and God be with you until we meet tonight all right God bless you did you enjoy that amen wasn't that wonderful I just you could just feel the nuggets of wisdom uh just pouring out and everything but I just wanted just to make a just a few comments ments uh certainly can't add to it um and I've listened to it and just even listening to it again so much more beautiful things open up but this is something that brother brandom said and and we're talking about principles things that we can place in our understanding that allow us to fight the battle of better in the battle that we're in and that's what we all want to do if God could give us anything better than his word he would have given it to us and that's his weapon is his word and and so you know uh that's one of the things that the privilege of hearing the spoken word we and in the hour that we're living in and the fact that we can actually hear a voice uh was just such a blessing to our age uh before you could read and you would just have to wonder what was said and wonder this and wonder that think to see what you might be able to put together and and everything and you just never could put it together but finally a a a a word came and the Word was opened and he began to to speak things to us that is a love letter to us it's just written in between the lines and and those that are elected they they hear what he's saying and it just it comes out because I I just think the way he puts his sentences together was divine so uh you might think I'm a little fanatical but uh it's okay I don't I'm happy so like brother B says I'm happy with this you know just leave me alone but he makes this statement and I just want to uh this statement that he made is the way that I approached the rest of what he was speaking about and he says he says and you know he said M you know he said uh junior did you smoke and he said no I didn't smoke and he says you broke every barrier he said from that time became a liar now brother BR makes this statement and it it it it sunk into me if you don't mind me just fellowshiping with you for a moment he says that's the way we start okay so don't only look back but what he's saying this is the way we start if we're going to make a change or if something's going to take place there's a starting place this is where we start so you start you have to have a starting place to go back and you have to have a starting place to go right so he says this is how it starts he says this is that's the way it starts we have to mark it from some time and so he says and and don't just walk over it by but like looking back and looking he says you have to mark it from sometime our mind immediately medely goes to the time but really is what he's saying is you have to mark it okay you've got to mark your blessings and you got to mark your mistakes you've got to know that you've made them you've got to know that I did this this is what I did and and and what I did caused this to happen and so he's he's saying you have to mark that you have to mark that you can't you just can't do things and do things and just let them fall by the wayside and and and say things and and not think that they're not having any effect or they're not affecting you okay that there's and he says he says he said so you've got to mark it from sometime you've got a market something happened okay you got a market something happened so if if if we don't have this Insight you understand that if you've ever offended somebody you know I remember one time I made a statement to a really close friend of M I didn't know what he was going through I didn't mean to say what I said but I said something and and he got mad and got up and left and we didn't talk to each other for years and years you know and and I and I had to go back to that time of what I said and what happened because I when I marked that time and I went back to that time that it happened then I had to mark that time before something could happen you understand I'm talking I hope you can apply this to your own life he says something happened and from that time it changed things so he say and he says we all have those kinds of times so we find out that in our lives you you're wanting to go forward you you've got to go back and find the time and Mark it when they changed both spiritually for the better and fleshly for the worse because if you don't mark it you won't deal with it and that was one of the greatest things that our Prophet could do he could go back into your life and find that time he could find that time the time it changed we all know the story about the the the little girl that got barked at by the dog and and from that time she got this fear and the fear led to this and led to that and it it absolutely affected her life and so he could take her back to that time and when she came in contact with that time then it came clear to her because once she came to the time that the change came was also the time that she could be changed right but it had to be marked so you you've got to mark your life you know you you've got to know the time that you prayed the time that you prayed many times when I I I I I reach certain battles in my life and I find myself falling to the the same spot I'll go back and say Lord I remember when I stood behind that church and I prayed for this I believe you heard my prayer I I I I told you I needed help but you've got to have that thought in your life you know that you know that that something took place in your life that you something changed and so we we do that because if you you've got to you've got to Mark the time that things change because he told us one of the things that the principles we go back to is when you get away away from him you've got to go back to where you left them you've got to go back to the time that you left them so you got to Mark the time you're blessed you've got to know the time that you left them you got to Mark the things that change you know this whole world wants us to be lukewarm it wants us to have amnesia it wants us to be numb it it wants us to get to the place we just think everything just happens by chance and we're not control and this is happening and that's happening and and I don't know what's going on and I'm just kind of wandering through life loss that's that's a deception the prophet God was talking to these people he says they all will tell you there was a time from that time I took my drink from that time I smoked from that time I lied from that time from that time from that time things changed and so if you you find yourself in a condition then you've got to find the time and Mark that spot find that St pray that it be revealed to you he lays that principle down also and be certain of God he said when you up against something he says you go back and turn every stone to find out if there's a time that caused something right and then when you make that right and you fix it then you can say this was the time I came to him this is the time I backslid and from that time I've been battling this from that time I've been battling that well once you go back to that time that the change happened to you then the change can take place am I making myself clear it it it a it's an a principle what happened to Moses he says Moses Moses was called to do this he went out there he tried to use the force you know what I mean he went out into the desert and then he had to come back to the time that he tried went to the burning bush then he could have a change and so the one of the things that we have to realize that's so beautiful is no matter where we're at there is a a a time that things can change in our lives there's a time that the corner can be turned there's a time we can come out of the depression a time we can come out of the finances there's a time of change a time of change exist right a place where we could say from that time I might find myself in the desert but if I know there's a time that that I know that God's got a time that I can come to life and find water that if I'm walking in a dry place I know there's a time that a Wellspring of life will come up so okay I know that he's got a time of change that he is that there's there is a from that time out there waiting for me I can take hope in that I can I can take rest in that that I'm not stuck here now something might have got me here and I can say from that time I got in this shape I quit paying my tithe I quit giving my offering I quit doing I quit doing that and you come back and say wow man I really in a financial mess and you go back and say wow uh from it was from that time that things begin to fall apart from for me well once you're there you went back to where you left them and when you go back to where you left them then you can meet them again and you'll have another from that time lord and that was so beautiful about the gospel and so there's a lot of things you know uh there's a a lot of things that you got to go back to you know a lot of times it's a decision you made to change your course you know what I mean because sometimes you got to go back and say well how did I get here you know it doesn't he used things like drinking smoking and all those things well those those things are is the is the the Dynamics of somebody that's found thems in sin they didn't start that way but they were tempted and drawn off by their own flesh and they went over and failed and sin was conceived and then it then it became practiced and then they made him a sinner but a lot of times with Christians you're not participating in those kind of sins but our failures are in decisions we make things we chose to do maybe we didn't pray about it maybe we didn't uh uh consider everything uh maybe we uh we felt pressure to get to rush to a conclusion and the prophet of God went over that in the message called letting off the pressure he said pressure will cause you to do things you normally wouldn't do so if you understand this principle of addressing things finding things finding the time find finding the the hour that you came under pressure the hour that you came under inspiration and filter it all back through the word of God go back over here what did it cause you to do what did it get you involved in so if you can go back through that process and find that time that you left him you go back there then what's waiting for you is a brand new from that time from the time I made it right the time I said forgiveness the from that time so it works on both ends a lot of times it's the view that you've taken or the opinion that you've formed you know I when I first came in the message the very first people I met they didn't like Perry green and Perry Green's gone now so not here to defend himself but those guys are gone too so I'm pretty safe but they didn't like brother Perry so man they just laid a picture of Perry green about me that you know the GU guy was you know he's terrible and I had an opinion never met the guy never heard him talk didn't know what he stood for or nothing I was poisoned I had an opinion I formed a view and my view was clouding my judgment and it caused me to say things do things have an attitude and an atmosphere around me because I listened well I was young then but now you know I I don't make that judgment because you know when I meant the brother you know of course I spewed all the all the vile things I heard about him and he just slowly defended himself told me what brother Braham said B but the whole story was different I went to being like brother Bram said that that guy that you're you know and just going why cuz there was a time that I listened to gossip there was a time that I formed opinions a lot of times your judgment the judgments you make uh uh they they they they affect and the opinions you have they affect your decisions they affect the things you do the way you go about things the way you treat people all all these things and and your whole course is being changed and you're and things and you're slowly drifting away from the from the sweetness and the joy and the presence of the Holy Spirit and you don't know why you're in the desert and you say well I'm not drinking I'm not spoken well why don't you look at what what you think about people why don't you look about your opinions why don't you look at your judgments go back to the time that I begin to think this way you know I I'll never forget when Rachel told me that she liked Gary I thought what something's wrong here you know and I remember going to I says are you sure you know and oh yeah brother David I really love him I don't know you know and man I I'm trying to get all kinds of opinions and filter everything now now he's he's he's one of our deacons you can be so wrong about stuff so wrong and it actually is affecting you and now you have from that time I begin to feel these ways about certain people my spirit changed my nature changed my peace changed my Joy changed my happy has changed everything because I got in this great big U wad of thoughts and opinions and judgments going on in my mind and and uh I I love brother bram's attitude towards that girl in the insan this island are you here are you a patient you know well oh what did you do yeah man he just all covering her sins I saw she could be a beautiful he looked at her and what did he see a lovely wife a a mother I mean come on can you imagine him taking the wrong opinion or the wrong judgment the effect and so we we've got this we've got to we've got to to especially the young people going to school and and start relationships you got to Mark those times you've got to Mark the influence you've got to measure the effect things are having on you the way it works on your mind the way it works on your emotions you've got to become aware of it and where it's taking you because it's causing a change in you and then you got to be able to say is that change right and if it's not right and it's not the further of the Gospel bringing you into hum humility then you've got to go back to that time that you that you changed those opinions that you came to that time and you got to go back to where you left him so you can have a brand new from that time and it makes your life you it's always that way daily it's good to sit down at the end of the day and go back back through the things you said the things you thought the way you treated people the attitude you had and then when you got something that's right go make it right Jesus said don't let the sun go down upon your wrath so all these are the really the principles that's going to make the church have power and keep the punches of the enemy off you when you mark the time he tries to punch you when he Mark you mark the time he tried to lay something on you and if you get one of those things working in you go back look at the effect it had look at what's going on and then you'll find out you can get in the presence of the Lord like that girl he said she got down and prayed he prayed with her I spent time with her and then finally she struck the fire Hallelujah she knew something was different she knew because she had a brand new from that time now she got up and said from this time she had it from that time and now she had it from from that time and both of them came from the same spot sess success and failure launches from the same point the same place and so I I I I just wanted just to share that with you this evening and and and and that you know that this is something that the prophet of God taught and I could take you to more than one places you you listen to tapes you probably have many of the same thoughts and different things that he expressed that and like he said you go back to where you left him you go back to where it started you go back to where it caused the The Faults the feelings the judgments the opinions if you got a bad jealous Spirit you got a bad feeling to somebody go back to where you got it cuz he didn't give it to you that's right and and it changed es so remember things these things they change things and if things are trying to change our life and the enemy is trying to change our life he's trying to change our course he's trying to change our spirit he's trying to change our love one for another he's trying to change our forgiveness and our tenderness and our care one for another then we got to we got to keep those punches off of us amen you believe it amen Lord bless you I'm glad you enjoyed your tape let's Stand Together the Lord's good isn't he he's just so good to us and and so if you're you're in a a place that you don't like and your spirit's not right I want you to know that there is a time waiting for you there's a from that time in your future a time that you'll find them a time that you'll stri the fire a time you'll strike your healing and if you're if you if you got things within you that are holding you down and you got a lot of mental battles and a lot of deep emotional feelings something caused it something can deliver you from it and that's what we always want to place Our Hope in let us bow our heads together our gracious Heavenly Father the such a beautiful word we heard tonight brought in such a beautiful spirit hidden words of wisdom just Lac through just 27 minutes of instruction the way UPS the way down you can tell it's God by how sweet and humble it is if it's puffed up you said that's not God lord we could have went through this paragraph by paragraph and just been so enamored with the wisdom and the glory in your word Lord we came tonight to just take a nugget home with us to understand that when things aren't right we've got to go back to where we got our attitude go back to where we got our spirit go back to where we got our feelings and go back and bring all those emotions and feelings and heartaches and find you you like that stinking leopard brother Ram called him he said Jesus if you would and Lord we can take all our emotions and feelings and weaknesses and the sin that so easily besets us and we can find you and say Lord would you forgive me would you deliver me and all the time that caused all what we are we'll have a new from that time and that's what I long for Lord I long for a new from that time I meant God from that time I talked it over with God from that time things changed father I hope this morning that you would this evening that you would bless that to each heart here and increase their understanding there's so
