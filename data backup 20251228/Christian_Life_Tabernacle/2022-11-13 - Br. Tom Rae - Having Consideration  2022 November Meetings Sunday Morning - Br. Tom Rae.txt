princesses [Music] [Music] the greatest love story [Music] [Applause] [Music] What a Beautiful Love Story God bless you this morning you may be seated amen amen certainly uh privilege to be here and this morning and great anticipation of all the things that the Lord can do for us and you know he's God's interested in people he's interested in sharing his blessings and being blessed but I don't know if all the brothers are still here but we've had some wonderful ministers with us this weekend and uh brother Raphael are you here this morning can I see I don't see him but his brother Raphael here where you at brother Raphael would you stand up brother we're amen God bless you brother Raphael kabaya from Rogersville as a wonderful church and I don't know if Brother Sam Parker did he have to go back he had to go back and you know it was really lovely having him from Wichita with us a few days and so uh too I'd like to thank everybody for their uh great patience and bearing with us and parking this year a few days the sun and the grace of God maybe we'll have something to park on here pretty quick so we're trust in the Lord for that anyway we wanted to thank a few people uh here for coming I know Tom mentioned the other day but brother Ken and sister Linda and their daughter Ava our granddaughter excuse me are here and they've come down year after year to be with us we really appreciate them if be that I'll stand up too that would be a blessing amen brother Ken and brother Tom used to terrorize the North together so they've been long time friends amen and Glenn and Shawna are here also down there friends of ours we vacationed with them and and stepped in some really strange places together so I are you here somewhere would you stand up to there you is your wife here with us she had to go back but brother brother Glenn's become a real buddy to us amen and the person that makes this home meeting possible and without her we wouldn't have this meeting because we wouldn't have a good preacher and we wouldn't have had a both good preachers are a result of her love and care sister Johanna would you stand up please amen that's two of brother biscoll's three daughters with us this morning and uh and you know it's it's good and then uh um Michael's wife's here Sister Abigail and where are you at sister travel again would you stand up please these are the two good women that make them the men that they are and without them they'd be nothing that's all true so it's all true amen amen so uh we're we're also very thankful for I think sister Rebecca and and Brother Andy and brother April and all of those that worked so hard for the luncheon serving and everything we we put that together uh Wednesday night so we just said let's do it and we went down the street and the church there gave us their parking lot and they gave us their room and we were able to do that so we wanted to thank all of you it takes all of you to to make these things possible and and so that's what we're so appreciative because it takes just takes an effort I thought how beautiful it was that our sisters from uh some of them from Zimbabwe and different countries and places and they're all here singing in Spanish amen that shows there's one thing huh yeah there's one God who is the father of us all right amen and and he he loves us so much you know the scripture says in Luke it says but rather seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom and this morning I believe with all my heart that before there ever was a star placed in the sky he knew this meeting would be here and as our brother spoke he sent one of those arrows out that it would arrive here this morning at this time to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you could ask or think I believe that if it's the father's good pleasure to give you and I'll put it in this terminology so you don't think it's a future tense or a past tense but this morning he wants to extend and share a greater amount of his kingdom with you and each of us personally if he wants to do something that will be a special for you I don't care where you're from I don't care the situation you are in the background you're in when I was that little hippie boy running around with the Hell's Angel motorcycle gang and and involved in the things that I was involved in the rock music scene and all those things I never would have dreamed that he had a message that would prepare me for my soon Rapture yes sir you know but he was mindful of me and he provided everything for me all along the way to get me to hear so I I don't know what's tomorrow holds but I know where I am now in this moment and so this is the moment that we want to take and we want to believe that he said wherever two or three are gathered together that I'll be in your midst and that he comes in our midst to do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can ask or think it's kind of been requested this morning and maybe by the cosmen could come to the piano and sister Julia will say I I tell sister Julie I said I want you to sing my song but there's something that made it possible this morning and it's the only place that we have to worship and it's under that shed blood and you might look at yourself or look at circumstances but remember somebody loved you so much that they sent their only begotten son that there could be something that stood there for you this morning and that's what we've come this morning to set ourselves under is to realize that this didn't happen by our work it happened by sacrifice it happened because someone was willing to go to the cross and take some nail scarred hands and that's what we're trusting in this morning above all things that you'll have faith in the price that he paid for you that it can do for you even above what you ask so before brother Tom comes let's just listen this Julia sing this and then maybe we can join in on the Last Stand Together and join in on the last verse as brother Tom will come amen [Music] that paid my way death it's price when it flowed down from the cross us my sins were gone sin for God there is a great that's right to hide this precious blood blood that gave me life but in three days he breathed again and Rose [Music] so I can't tell you Proclaim that is coming back for you there is a blood that cites the blind it heals the sick the lonely fights it has a power to free the band has changed they fall upon the ground so pour it out to cleanse my soul and let his liquid Glory flows because it lives [Music] to tell you that it's just so I'm so calm to tell you that he says [Music] like this prize this Blood this world this life he paid he paid the price with Precious Blood there is a blood that caused a life that paid my way death is [Music] my sins were gone my sins were gone there is a grave that's right to hide this precious blood that gave me life but in three days he breathed again [Music] tell me please [Music] what can wash always [Music] like without foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign all about the blood Lord [Music] could wash away our sins nothing but the blood of Jesus what can make me whole again nothing but the blood of Jesus Christ Lord we've reveled in that song this morning Mr Julia singing I pray father God that the reality of the life of that blood living within a people become more real than it's ever become in their lives father God we have not been made for this Kingdom we have made been made for another kingdom and father we will pray thy kingdom come thy will be done in this Earth as it is in heaven so Lord as we have gathered this Sunday morning to honor the resurrection Lord we want to give you all the glory all the honor and all the praise truly the tomb is empty the stone has been rolled away and father God we want to give you the glory in Jesus name amen amen thank you musicians God bless you I can greet you all in the name of Jesus Christ this morning nice to see your smiling faces the time right now is 12 23. I just thought you might want to take a note on that so so just in case you think I'm a long preacher okay we're thankful Brother David for your kind invitation and the assembly for your love that you've shown to us brother Aliante where are you where are you he's the greatest host that I know Sister Deborah the greatest cabbage roll maker on the planet I said my son this morning I I grew up in a little town called Chilliwack and it's a Mennonite town and and it's German and I have I've had German cabbage rolls and everybody claims that they've got the best cabbage rolls in the world I don't know how that ever got to to be an issue until of course you meet a Ukrainian wife and the background of Ukrainian cabbage rolls but I have to say Romania wins God bless you for your love and for your your kindness that's it's just been tremendous and thank you on behalf of my family I lost a friend over this last couple of years I can't say I lost a friend but he's a great friend of mine brother Glenn gruner and uh um I I guess I you know Brother David just pushed me aside and says I think I'll travel with a another fellow or something and uh I call Brother Glenn our most traveling Deacon on the planet I don't know I I have to die I never know where he is he's flowering somewhere but now I'm finding out who he's traveling with and uh I I just trust that they have a wonderful time without me I'm sure they do yeah they probably have a Coke on me and they say Poor Tom but it's been wonderful to have you brother Glenn Glenn brother Glenn has supported me all my trips in China has been as he could be there and he makes sure that I'm taking care of and and he does his Grand job and for that brother Glenn I I thank you for it and without Shauna you talk about wives you want to talk about wives brother Glenn doesn't have a clue Hut address I just thought a lot of money don't let the world know right I mean the sister Shawna lays out everything for him for seven eight ten days I can't believe it I said how come you look so great my wife dresses me she's not even here oh she's got it all pre-packaged foreign so if there's any credit that goes to Glenn's attire please give it to Sister Shauna amen well have you enjoyed yourselves I I have enjoyed myself immensely and uh man I said to Michael you might as well just take Sunday morning and he's been preaching just tremendous I love his ministry I love him and pray God they'll continue to use him in a mighty way now you're stuck with me this morning so or we'll go to the word if you don't mind I'm I'm going to turn I go to Hagia if you don't if you don't I'll give you some time to get the haggy eye somebody need a little bit more time than others but hey he lays it out pretty good but it's not um it's not my I want you to stay with me this morning because I'm going to do a few turns in the road and you might think that I'm I'm trying to make a point about your new building or something but I am making a point about your new building um no I'm not and I I just something just stirring in my heart and I was studying yesterday morning and looked at this scripture and it so went in line with where I'd like to go so haggai chapter one the Bible says in verse 1 in the second year of Darius the king in the sixth month the first day of the month came the word of the Lord and we got everybody okay okay by hagiai the prophet understoodable the son of shatil governor of Judea and to Joshua the son of Jose dick Jose dick the high priest saying thus speaketh the Lord of hosts saying this people say the time has not come the time that the Lord's House should be built then came the word of the Lord by haggai the prophet saying it is time for you oh ye to dwell in houses sealed with house sealed houses and this house is lie waste now therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts consider your ways now I'm not saying that like I said I'm not saying even though that it could apply somewhere but I'm not going that direction but I would like you to take a word because it takes time to consider and I'd like to speak on having consideration that's powerheads Heavenly Father we've read your word we pray father that you will make your Word Alive make it true and real to every heart so we've read your word Lord It's Eternal spoken and God we just pray that you'll take the the substance of it and make it alive to every one of us in the name of Jesus Christ amen you may have your seats there's a lot of things that you could we could go through in the subject of consider or consideration and everybody wants to do something on the Fly these days make a decision on the Fly but there's some things that we need to realize we have to consider our actions because there's going to be a day that you're going to be answerable to your actions and so then before you do something because this day and age is a quick age things are happening and they want you to make a decision quickly and you make a decision this morning whether you want to serve God or not I've got quotes if you want you know if more of Evangelistic type of service and you want to realize if you don't get saved you go to hell you get saved you go to heaven that's a consideration some people fall asleep already and want to go home well why are you here that's my question why be here don't hinder the service you know it's a consideration you considered to come to church you said well what am I going to wear to come to church I'm going to look handsome in this or I'm going to look beautiful in this how do you like my tie you like that diet so I consider I have another tie that I like wearing with that so you know you make out these these thoughts you considered you know who you're going to marry consider what church you attend there's consideration Falls in so many categories and and yet we understand with these thoughts that we think there's also a consequence that comes with your consideration there's always consequence well if I do this this happens if I do this this happens and a lot of people say well you do that it's bad and I say well how come maybe it might be good who are they to tell me on my own consideration you know I wished maybe a uh Aiken would have sat down and talked to somebody before he made his decision and considered to take us a silly wedge of gold and a Babylonian garment really that was worth the destruction of his wife and his children and his cattle and his lamb so you say well that's a that's a little that's a little subject that we could touch on and that would be a deep subject that we could cover but just that little simple Act caused a destruction of his family so it was deeper than just I think I'll grab that or I'll have that and I'll hide that under my dent consideration to consider your ways and you say well brother Tom you know we're all saved well that's great and we're all in the mess that's good and and and and how happy I am that you have come to that position but let me tell you as soon as you leave church today you're going to have to consider a lot of thoughts and so now before I get a little dance on the bubble type of thing of Hallelujah glory to God we're going to come down to a little bit of hey this is serious life because decisions that you make today the prophet said will tell you where you will be five years from now so that's that's pretty deep and then you got College children or children that are graduating and they want to go to a college and my first reaction would be well is there a work to there is there a church there why would you even consider going there right so so there there's things that we need to just step back a bit and consider what does God want because it's not our will but it's God's will and but but we're getting so charged to make decisions how many how many have a smartphone oh I know that that was that's embarrassing isn't it I'm smarter than hey this is not sin and it's just how you use it you know so we have a smartphone so then you use a phone and how many have had a text that you have not replied immediately and then all of a sudden you get another text where are you my own time right so everybody wants to make a decision for you hey you want to meet us for lunch well maybe I don't want to meet you for lunch maybe that's why I'm not answering you but you know before it used to be you know send a Pony Express right you want an answer wait three months you get a letter but now it's everything's quick on demand you don't have time really to consider the things of life that really matter really matter and so then as life goes on and Technology speeds on and I was talking to a brother in the Philippines whose son is in the AI realm artificial intelligence and augmented reality and he's high up in that age he said in in five years from now just throw away your iPhones and Androids he said they won't even be in existence well you say well how could that be well just think about it 10 years ago you never had an Android or or a smartphone so technology is moving on and it's never moving on for your benefit okay you say well I I'll have more time are you kidding me I would told my wife when I got my first 8880 880 whatever computer 8088 oh yeah before his time I said honey computers just think I can study faster no you just have more material we used to come to the pulpit with two or three pages now we come with 20. so it you know the thing the reality of life is things will speed up and is speeding up and all that is to detract you from the things of God and we have to start realizing where we're living in two kingdoms and that's why we pray thy kingdom come thy will be done because we do not live for this Kingdom we use this Kingdom can I say that again we use this Kingdom and I always look at this way plunder the Philistines plunder with all you can and use whatever you plunder for the kingdom of God I know I'll get a question on that one but that's okay I don't mind plundering the Philistines I said the Philippines one day and everybody looked at me weird because I was going to the Philippines don't blunder the Philippines they got nothing to plunder time goes on and as time goes on there shouldn't be less consideration for the things of God there should be more because the trick of the enemy is to consume your mind to take away that real estate of thinking away from the things of God that's why the scripture says in the days of The Voice because we needed a voice because you've got the voice of Economics you do have the voice of Technology you have the voice of success you have everything pushing you away from the voice of God boy that was a real raw Ross Damon wasn't it he said well I knew that already well then go to over it get rid of those other voices mm-hmm because they are right now I mean if you're in business you got to think of what's Happening next week is everything all planned up and set up that's fine but don't let it occupy your mind where you don't have time for the things of God so we're going to talk about the consideration of mortal to immortality because there is a spirit that is trying to hold you back from the place where you belong we don't belong here that's why you're not happy here and we know and we start to realize that there is a kingdom coming that we are a part of and that there should be something within you and me this morning saying Lord let the kingdom come because this world is crumbling and falling apart it used to be a time even when brother Ken and I were growing up in our 20s that our moms for some rare reason I'm only saying that because Ken told me about what his mom said I know what my mom said oh honey you're such Doom and Gloom things will get better well here we are 40 some odd years later and let me tell you things aren't better things are worse because a prophet said in north and not it will get worse and worse and worse so we're under the prophecy of the arrow so now as we go on a Sunday morning service now we're just going to dig a little deeper in God's love all right we're going to dig a little bit deeper and just and just see what the Holy Spirit would have this morning can you turn to a Hebrews chapter 11 verse 27. for those that are looking for success we're going to read about a man that had everything at his fingertips Hebrews 11 27 says by faith talking about Moses he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured are you listening to me he endured as seeing him I want you to really I'm I'm going slow for a reason as seeing him who is invisible now who who said so foreign I saw him who is invisible and look what he did by seeing someone who was invisible he took two million people out of the grip of Egypt by the faith of seeing him who was invisible everybody there I'm right there okay wow brother Billy gave me the authority to read from Christ the minister God revealed he says every time you come here he said you used Christopher God revealed I said yeah I'm stuck with it I love it and I always I love uh wow so I want you to understand Moses by faith came out of Egypt right but why because he endured as seeing somebody who was what invisible oh somebody that was invisible you have a picture here I noticed the invisible has become visible so Moses by faith came out of Egypt and you had to believe what he said and then a prophet comes in this generation and says I said the same God that Moses meant is the god that I meet and he's still invisible but one day that invisible God became visible and they said it's not just a picture of a pillar of Fire it is a picture of God who was the invisible becoming visible so really what you're looking at now is two Dimensions meaning don't look it at a picture because that Pillar of Fire came from somewhere and he came from another dimension to this Dimension to a prophet that was in this Dimension to take you back to that dimension that's what the message is all about it's not starting at church we are the church we're going from this place to another place okay I slowed it down a bit that pretty good huh man get going with it Tom so now brother Brown says here on page 92. of things that are of uh Christ that mystery God revealed the Great Angel of the Covenant now now I I really want to emphasize this point because we're going to move from that point to another point that invisible that dwelt in another Realm Where Angels dwell where future homes being built in another dimension I want to get you out of this dimension uh-huh feely touchy hurty look past this Dimension because this Dimension is passing away so God sent a prophet to let you see into that Dimension so that you could feel a pull and only those that belong there have the pull and you say well you are crazy yep let me alone I love this I have been called to another dimension now he said the great Angel of the Covenant the one who was with Moses in the wilderness everybody got that you say oh I love Cecil B demille's he just that picture of the Ten Commandments is just incredible it's far past Cecil Peter Mills the one that was with Moses in the wilderness the one who met Paul now he's bringing it now thousands of years forward thousands the one that met Paul on the road to Damascus is the same one who allowed his picture so now Moses has declared to you he endured Egypt he left Egypt by seeing into the invisible now you have a prophet at the end of the ages saying that one who's now invisible is becoming visible and who is he coming visible to to you to the elect to only the sea Gene that even care because what amazes me is when I watch deep calleth the deep it doesn't amaze me that there's people that's not interested in this even in this church or my church at home it's not my church at our church at home in Cloverdale you have people that just come to church because maybe parents pushed you to come to church but there's no real Drive there's no real desire there's no real nothing there we're praying that there will be and we want it to happen but the desire for the things of God has only been given by God so a church can't give it to you a preacher can't give it to you a prophet said that you were predestinated for this only the predestinated see this oh I'm sorry friends you can tell a person about this message all you want but it takes a revelation from God himself to open their eyes to see this one who was once invisible becoming visible yeah say well I've been in meetings for so many years you can't tell me anything I don't know already well then why are you here if you're so spiritual how come you're not changed and gone there's obviously something in our lives that God is working on and I say Oh Holy Spirit we have meetings like this for you to work on the inner man because the outer man what perishes so now what you're looking at when you see the picture next time just say I'm looking at two different dimensions one that came into this dimension and one that lived in this dimension brother Branham lived in this dimension but then he says to us and we'll get into it he says I live in that other dimension sometimes More Than This dimension so people were wanting to get healed they wanted their names to be told and what he's trying to do is pull us from here to there and we still got the thing we got to pray we got to do saints of God we do pray and we do do but that's not the purpose of the message the message is to translate us into a rapture we're all right that only took 20 minutes okay well we're watching the time so Moses forsook Egypt fearing or not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured seeing him who was invisible can you turn to Second Corinthians 4 and 18. this is why nothing impresses me in this realm nothing because everything in this realm second Corinthians 4 18. everything in this realm that you see around you is perishing I know I know everybody gets caught up in in life and and we've got to live that I'm not saying we're not going to live but don't get it caught up in life because the things that that the devil tantalizes our our feelings and our emotions and our memories and our affections and all these other things are really just passing away use them lately second Corinthians 4 18 well we look not at the things that are so you can read that that you can you can help me read I'm a slow learner at school while we look not at the things which are but at the things which are not for the things that are are temporal but the things which are not are eternal so now we're just we've just been planning it real slow I know I know you know we get so tantalized by laodicea by Amazon who knew Amazon's even name a few years ago Alibaba the Chinese website guys a billion gazillionaire and they're selling things and you again buy you can buy them on screen and send them back and then and all of a sudden you didn't go Windows the old idea used to be you brother Brown talks about it window shopping I think it's window grabbing that's what's happening these days they're going in grabbing everything start to realize things of life are just a tool to live and not a means to live for so while we look at the things which are seen we look not at the things that are seen But at the things which you're not seeing for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal so then if we start looking at the Unseen then brother Brahman says we are told that the outward man and the inward men are two different people the outward man looks with his eyes but the inward man looks and walks by faith um this is where we like to go that's why David can look at Goliath and see nothing because it's temporal he was anointed as a prophet to be king so there was nothing that's going to stand in his midst I could care less if there were 50 goliaths it's just a number it's just the number it wasn't even the stone that killed Goliath it was the faith that was behind the stone so if you look at the outward man Israel knocked their knees and worried that this guy's a giant David looked at his God who was in an unseen Realm and said I can kill that thing and I want you to know this morning you can kill anything you want it's whether you want that's the problem we had homosexual come to our church and brother biscoll nailed them right between the eyes he says I want to be delivered he says no you don't he says you love that demon you cannot get Deliverance unless you hate the thing that is causing you problems come on come on you gotta hate that Spirit you gotta say I deny that devil I rebuke you in the name of Jesus Christ I hate you well you say well brother Tom how can can I can you give me an example I'll give you an example I was once a smoker before I got saved and I hated it and I hated it because everybody was telling me that it's not good for you but it's not smoking a cigarette it's a demon behind the cigarettes so every time I wanted to quit I crumpled it up and I threw it out the window but I counted the fence post because I knew tomorrow I needed those cigarettes you didn't really hate it you just disliked it but when I got saved and the Bible says he that destroys this Temple I will destroy I start to realize I gotta hate that thing that's out to destroy me and by hating it and asking Jesus to come into the temple I've never had a problem with cigarettes in my mouth from the day I got saved the key and you say well you're talking about cigarettes we could get into many areas of life personally and you know your area better than anybody and you say well brother Tom we want a prophet to discern that Spirit of lust or that anger or that whatever we want to put there when it's already being discerned by the word right now it just didn't call your name he just came to your address so the things that trouble us are temporal you can deal with it right now you can take the word of God and bind that demon and say never to bother me again we live in dimensional realms and I'm more and more your being inundated by it I grew up in 1954 when I was born and my television that my father bought as a babysitter because my mom was going to have another baby and the only thing I could see was an image in snowflakes now you don't have a clue outside being older than me what I'm talking about you turned on the TV and was black and white dots fuzzy fuzzy fuzzy and you had to stand on top of the roof with the antenna how many of us froze on top of the roof a hockey games playing you can't see nothing to the left to the right get it right and now technology man I walk into a electronics store and you see the pictures that are unbelievable beautiful I said where were you when I was three years old but it only is getting better because it's Satan's Eden to attract the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life but I'm letting you know this morning that's temporal that is a temporal realm of reality is what they would call it's not even real everybody in that picture is a phony you think that she looks that beautiful are you kidding she's had a makeup artist for four hours making her up then they get a graphic God designer to take every pimple and pour out of her face I'm just trying to help you and we get so enamored by the Marlboro Man the guy in a horse oh I'm for God I'm in Texas you know he's got that sheepskin jacket on with the hat on his head and he's the Marlboro Man he's dead you know did you know what he died of cancer yeah great product to be selling but I'm not selling you a project uh I'm not selling you a product it's free that's right it's free whatever they have is temporal and it's passing away and it means nothing today so whatever you think is something it is going to be nothing and so now we want to by faith now start looking from this natural realm into a spiritual Realm and so often the prophet would say now he's here he's just 20 feet away or he's just 10 feet away or he's just above me or he's standing right here what was he trying to do bring you into another dimension who did she touch is that that you remember that or who did he touch so it wasn't a physical touch it was a faith touch and so if God could just increase your faith a little bit this morning not to touch the things of life but to look into another realm of where you're going then I pray that the Holy Spirit would achieve what he wants for you this morning the Bible says this in second Corinthians 4 and 15. for all things are for your sakes of course we could preach stop right there that's the abundant grace might through the Thanksgiving of many redowned to the glory of God now we're looking at Old English we're looking at what the King James version says here but if you look at the different translations that were were used to get to this point you find out then these things are for your sake that the remarkable Grace of God reaches to more people and it increases at Thanksgiving to the glory of God so it's not you But as God using you to reach the many because there's people like us that wanted what we've got now that didn't know how to get what we got run from church to church spoke to people spoke to theologians and we were looking and trying to find what the word is termed God but then we find through a message you can't find him he finds you so is God reaching From Another Dimension to this Dimension to bring you back to that dimension just I hope I'm not confusing you because I'm trying to just go as slow as possible so that you can realize that the crazy seats that you're sitting in we I don't mean it crazy in the sense of crazy crazy I mean it's the material that was made to make deceit is non-existent right now as far as God's concerned you need it because you're in this dimension but once you move to that Dimension and once this world gets a renovation it's all gone and I think let me let me help you on this other thought just I'll just help try and help you because this really became real to me anybody heard of Fukushima Fukushima Nuclear Plant and and the disruption and uh Fukushima had on on on the people towns were Swept Away by tsunamis nuclear fallout was everywhere people are dying did you see the the rivers of homes floating away Vehicles being Swept Away did anybody see that I'll I'll try and help you I did houses beautiful homes being swept away cars that were worth thousands of dollars getting swept away maybe 24 hours before that the husband and wife got together and said hey we're not going to Window Shop we're actually going to buy we have saved up ten thousand dollars to buy this vehicle or to buy this object what did it mean 24 hours later what did it mean 24 hours later their expression is as long as we got away with our life so the house didn't matter the things that the house didn't matter the car didn't matter but what matters is life and why does a preacher preach it's for your life Let Jesus Christ that Giver of Life Come From Another Dimension into this room but there has to be an atmosphere and I believe it's here where you can reach out and say nothing is impossible nothing's impossible listen no snickering boys brother Michael was talking about the other day they were snickering they were mocking they weren't sitting there like you and nice and listening so attentively they weren't sitting there listening to a prophet's story they were mocking a prophet they were telling their own things and they're doing their own thing so I don't care where you are I know that in a moment when that Arrow got shot nothing going to stop those two children to fall at the feet of Jesus Christ so that's what I believe and so that is another dimension for the Bible says in second Corinthians 5 and 7 we walk by and not by can we read that together again for we walk by and not by okay anybody ever wanted something so bad that you just thought about it 24 hours a day I got one man on this brother right here I I says oh man my son is sweater I gotta have right I gotta put away that extra few shekels to buy that sweater that might make me look so great for whom is my question I will look at these brothers and say that again who do we want to look great for do we want a great great so that guys could be looking at us or do we want to be great that Jesus would be honored to walk with us [Music] so we do not walk then by sight we walk by faith we walk by faith brother Ram says this in Fellowship of redemption now in meetings sometimes I watch those Visions become material I thought oh God how can it be when standing here a minute ago stood a man with his arms folded looking to me and I heard his voice talking to me and telling me things that's going to happen there they've never failed yet he vanishes away and I know then that there is a land beyond the river that's what we want to be focusing on now for the next little while there is a land beyond the river that they call the sweet forever he says there's a lamb beyond the river there's a region Yonder there's somewhere that that glorious persons of the great angels of God and their beings are fellowshipping again can you imagine we're sitting in this little church and God has got his angels fellowshipping in a realm where you're going who wants to go there [Applause] glorious who put that desire there God put that desire there and we're not going to be tied down by by anything Satan throws at us no Gadget say no Gadget no fashion no car no house nothing that's temporal gonna hold me from going to that dimension right we either believe this message or we don't you either believe what I just preached to you right now or just walk out of the church because saints of God to me is more real than you sitting here he says now I know there's a land beyond the river there's a region out yonder somewhere that the Glorious persons of the great angels of God and his beings are fellowshipping again oh the fellowship God wanted back at the beginning has now started to move down come on people father loves Fellowship Christ the mystery God reveals he loves Fellowship that's what he wants and Satan wants to take it from you barely get it time to pray 15 minutes hmm I got a few whoms mm-hmm can I he takes it away because we get so caught up with the things of life but we walked on after the natural but we walk after the things of God by faith he said your sight your hearing you're feeling you're smelling you're tasting we cannot be normal without them but there's something missing some portion of life that we cannot contact without the sense acting whatever those senses are yielded to they will dominate you so we covered the five senses didn't we so whatever you're yielding to will dominate you but by no means were those five senses given to you to guide you they were given to you only for Earthly contact so there's a contact here that only these five senses contact but there's a sixth sense it is the faith sense that reaches out of this realm into another Realm your natural eye sings sees things that are created your eyes have faith see the supernatural Realm Beyond this realm the outward man is a part of creation and it sees this creation but the inward man that came from the Creator that germ seed put there looks beyond the five senses and looks into another Realm now you say well you know it's brother Tom you you have you know it seems like when you're preaching you're preaching we can do it and we can do it and we're more than conquerors and services after service that's right that's what I'm preaching you're Conquering the outer man by the word because Satan plays with us and we think that this is our Utopia this is the worst you're ever going to know get off Fox News see I got it more than that um I even got a few rights on that one how about CNN MSNBC because it's not news it's gossip you know I I want to know what's happening in Ukraine and I'm and they're talking about some comedian Stephen Colbert or something was he there's no news who's Madonna front news these are demons you might as well let them know what it is and you say well I know Madonna say those are demons just get into the realm where the Prophet wasn't he'll tell you exactly what these stripped down striptease people are they're demons that are tantalizing the fleshly man to keep them away from the spiritual Realms of God and he's got the world don't you worry he's got them but now he's now fighting for your soul and that's why God sent a messenger that could reach within that realm to let you know what that realm was about so that your heart would be turned not just from Egypt but to another land future home things that are to be these are key messages rapture you read them you heard him read them again when that woman touched His Garment or when blind Bartimaeus stop Jesus did they touch him by face or by the natural man said blind Martin Emmaus Jesus couldn't even hear him the crowd was too loud but he had a need and there is only one that could reach that need and what he said the Bible says he cried out Jesus and Jesus never heard him Jesus never heard him the natural man the Flesh of Jesus never heard him but the god part of the man heard the faith part of another man and delivered him we want to lift your face up not your emotion come on we want to lift up your faith this morning let's forget about the emotion that we love emotion because without emotion it means you're dead but we want to raise your faith level to a realm where all things are possible thank you there has to be an expectation that creates a desire that doesn't come from me pumping you up but there's an expectation of the Inner Man that says there is a place better than this place and and now Paul writes in Philippians according to my Earnest expectation and my hope that in nothing I shall be ashamed but that with all boldness as always so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body whether it be by life or by death it is something that's driving us man amen it's not something that you're scolded into or yelled into as a coach would on a football field as we took the analogy yesterday you're out of position but by the word of God we start to understand that there is another realm that's more real than this realm because we had a prophet step within both realms and we get caught up in one Realm but if you want to take the quotes that I'm going to be quoting and different things that are being said there's more that he talks about that Realm then you even understand or I've understood before studying this little subject just think he says just think you're at the end of time now time will fade into eternity maybe today so the question would be where would you be where is your heart where's your expectation where's your anticipation your dinner you know I have this is a crazy thing that happened to me in Dallas Texas my wife says that everything you think about is food she's not going to dispute it she's standing right there see how you finished breakfast you already got lunch plan and when lunch is done there's dinner we're having dinner huh but being here I don't have no desire for food because I'm fed up that's a good thing right but this feeding of the Soul is what's way more important and it's really going to do something very special for you because you'll start looking at hey the suit it's just cloth the tie it's just whatever brother Graham said in the message Shalom there's something laying ahead of us the years have been Joy and we've been looking for looking forward to the pressing coming of a great light and now we can see the breaking over that horizontal Realm it's breaking between Mortal and immortality shalom 1964. we see it breaking Between Heaven and Earth from an Earthbound sickness and troubled world into a bright shining day of immortal life and an immortal body and an immortal Earth that shall never pass away oh it's a shalom unto the church it's light time for the coming of Believers but it's a gross Darkness for the people that's an announcement that's an announcement that is where we're going and it's breaking and it's becoming realer and like some brother told me he says where do you get the word realer and he says I'm making a dictionary up of all your new words but it's becoming realer and realer now let's just digress for a minute because I know you're you're growing weary already so I'll just try and speed things up a bit hints works on your senses foreign Commerce worked on your senses you go to buy a suit first thing what do you do don't try it on you feel the fabric maybe only guys do that girls don't do those sort of thing you should feel my suit huh they deal with your senses stores I can't it I won't even name brand the store okay stores pump fragrance into the air because they want because by the sense of smell makes you time travel because if you smell that smell again somewhere else it brings you back to the place where you first smelled it that's right let me help you out Ken can help me with this word because I can never say it right Mitsubishi thank you he was he was the smarter one of the class so I want to say it louder Mitsubishi their sales were down so they had a department in their sales department and said how do we increase our sales so a gentleman came up with a great idea he says let's get a scratch and smell pad and put it in our ad and the smell was new leather who's ever stepped into a new car and smelt new leather ah it has that off heel you know what I mean you know what their sales went up their sales went up within a week 16 percent just by a little patch that you could scratch and smell new leather it was all phony but they sold cars how about another sense of hearing I looked it up yesterday as I Was preparing you deserve a break today you wouldn't even know that one how many knows that jingle you deserve a break today huh it's called the golden arches that was their jingle when they first came out you deserve a break today really it's a nightmare their eggs aren't eggs I just thought I'd help you out on that one how about mm-hmm good anybody know that is anybody old enough to know that it's October scissors they're put your hand out I'm not looking at you there's no way that means Campbell Soup what were they doing they were getting your sense of your hearing um good we we thought that was a good one in University Campbell's Soup how about oh no you wouldn't know this one because you're not my age it hit the spot Pepsi that's why I'm a Pepsi drinker not a Coke drinker the real thing are you kidding me so all these sayings are to what get a hold of your outer man but God sent a voice not to get your outer man not to tingle your ears but they hit the Inner Man and it's a bullseye every time yeah [Applause] I'm trying to bring the back back and forth to you to understand this world is using you it's abusing you and and it's directing your even the trains of your thought that's why you need to sit down and consider am I being affected by laodicea or am I being affected by the word of the Lord I came from these meetings I wanted God to meet me it's not by your feelings it's by the word and has it hit the target yes it has amen Hallelujah for you to have an expectation where did that expectation come from God so expectation then of expectation came from God does God have expectation he surely does Isaiah penned that arrow down oh man I love that message Mike you preach it again at home preach it here again preach it everywhere you want because it's profound because that word was sent forth it was sent forth and the Bible says in Isaiah 53 and it pleased the Lord to be bruise him and put him to grief that when they'll make his soul an offering for sin and we go there and we use that scripture wonderfully because it's of my most beautiful scripture but in squeezed in there says he shall see his seed yes do you see that there you see that there so he has an expectation he went to the cross for you and me knowing he's going to see you where is he going to see you he's not going to see you here he's going to see you at the wedding supper he shall see his seed now I want you to say I am his seed I'm in seed I've been birthed by the word I am his Gene I am his expectation I am not living for this world I'm living for another world hmm the Lord himself has an expectation we have children and we have expect them to be certain types of people we expect them to be doctors and lawyers or accountants or firemen or doctors or whatever policemen whatever accountants there's an expectation that comes with the parent I remember telling my son he came home one day not Michael so I won't say the other one to a half but one of them comes home said dad he's in grade four he said Dad I want to be a flag person I go what he said I want to be a flag person son a flag person I said get your ambition higher come on flag person stop go stop I'll get to that point I said okay okay I thought man this is unbelievable how did I raise a flag person he is you know he owns the company actually so anyway I go to my office and I get down to pray for him for a thought for the local assembly and it seemed like the Holy Spirit was saying what's wrong with that what is wrong with that I got rebuked I mean it was a major rebuke he said if he wants to be a flagger let him be a flagger let him be the best flagger I said okay so I went up to Sam I says hey Sam if you want to be a flag or be a flagger and we left it at that so then when he got out of school he worked for a a landscape company you know landscape companies they got dump trucks and they got you know back up you know and hold traffic where we go out of our minds because we're being held by two minutes when are they gonna move that dragon come on so Sam was working away at this landscape company and his boss says go get the stop sign and be the flagger um so he says okay so it got to be what hey watch what your heart desires you're gonna get it and you're gonna know what sometimes that's why I said consider consider so he gets this soft sign and you've always seen those people that stand there huh and so he says okay this is my chance I'm control of the whole traffic system of British Columbia and he holds the stop sign the guy who drives right by him foreign stop so the next guy comes out driving up stops for a minute takes off and he says what's the matter with you people that was his end of his stop sign career but now he owns a company that's bizarre I never thought of that until now but here we are God has a desire within our hearts and he's going to fulfill that desire whatsoever you desire When you pray you shall have what you ask you know what I'd love this morning you should say brother Tom the hearts desire would be I want to go to heaven I want to go to heaven I I want to be with the Lord Jesus if that reality became real to you this morning then I'd say well this broken up little message meant something to somebody you've moved you from where now Satan has tried to hold you and that's why brother Brown said he said God broke Satan's grip in future home he broke the grip of Satan without this message I'm sorry you're gripped by the Devil Himself looking to the Unseen my subject tonight he says is looking at the Unseen we are told that we have an outward and an inward man the outward man looks with his eyes and the inward man walks by faith so we have to be led by one of these two persons outside the outside or the outward man is self the inward man is God you see we do not see with our eyes though many times we have thought we see with our eyes but there was given you a sixth sense and that Sixth Sense only belongs only to Christians did you get that The Sixth Sense only belongs to Christians you can not have this Sixth Sense until you become a Christian is the only way that you could ever have any more than five senses for the natural man but the Sixth Sense is better known to Christians as their faith sense it's the one that governs you and guides you and it's Superior to all other senses um it's Superior to all other senses all of the five senses the super sense is the Holy Spirit the faith of God that dwells in you and if you will let the five senses be yielded to that sixth sense it will guide you and bring the other five senses under its control and that then becomes your super sense it's so far above the natural sense as the spiritual man is above the natural man it's as far and high as Heaven is above the natural man and its five senses reach higher look higher think deeper reach for the promise of God amen it makes you believe things you can't see that's where we'd love to start preaching now it makes you believe for the things you can't see well you say brother Tom I have that growth I can't see it but my faith tells me it's gone my faith tells me that that complex that is in another realm is not my complex it's the devil's complex and I resist that complex and I take dominion over that complex and I stand as a daughter and a son of God and I live far above this Earthly man it's a super sense that reaches out that came from God and it's called faith yes sister you with the back black gloves on your hand raise up look look at me if I don't quote to you your prayer that you're praying that I heard in another dimension in another world I'll tell you what you were praying will you believe that Jesus heard you so now it wasn't William Branham come on let's get together it wasn't William Branham that heard her prayer it was the god and William Branham that heard her prayer it was the god in that messenger that's trying to bring you out of this realm into another Realm ah but we get so caught up especially use and I'm not looking at the the older ones are past this front rows here oh I look so lovely this morning it's so far past that you might look lovely that's good or you might look so handsome there's another realm we live for keep your eyes on that Realm keep your eyes on that prize he said sister do you believe that Jesus heard your prayer now here's a man that's coming out of two realms sister you don't think I don't know what you're thinking right now he said how could you know what I'm thinking right now God knows every thought that you're thinking now and will ever think he knows we say well that's just he's a sir that he's just um preaching and nothing's going to happen to me he knows your thought and he knows that that unbelief is sitting there but now he also knows that faith is sitting there and you say just a second here I'm hearing a preacher preach and I'm going to tell that devil I'm not going to have that unbelief anymore I I'm putting a stop to this by the word of the Lord I'm reaching into another dimension pulling it down to this Dimension and say Satan yeah I accept my healing I Take God at his promise he said now I'm raised you he says now I've raised you up to a level of faith she he got she got raised up to a level of faith he said you believe he governs that by Sixth Sense super sense oh how Marvel it is to know it think how simple it is to believe it oh sister dear didn't you hear from another dimension and you've been listening to William Branham for how many years and yet now realizing that it's not William Branham I'm listening to it's the spirit of God through the vessel that's trying to Quicken your heart and turn your heart not just from Egypt it turned it to now heaven here's a man here I believe is honest in heart I've never seen him before God knows all about him I had talked to him a minute and see what God would do it's hard sometimes to single out straight in front of me at least two dozen people are praying right now their Spirits are in another world and when the vision starts coming they start moving this way and that way and I can't detect which one it is but then I look this way and that's where you are so after so many you can't tell where you're at hardly I'm trying to get you singled out and I keep seeing a woman coming before me and I don't know why it's a woman standing before me why brother it's your wife you're standing here praying for your wife I've never seen her in my life till just now but she's got some sort of trouble in her bowels and they don't know what to do don't you worry Jesus Christ is going to make her well let me say that operated by The Sixth Sense and the same Sixth Sense is in you so why don't you take control over your domain amen I got this problem no more say no more no more devil you can't occupy this mine but you must hate it [Applause] stomp it Beat It rebuke it [Applause] but we we like living with it don't live with that Saints voted out because it's not going with you Hallelujah praise the Lord can you say victory is mine victory is mine he's been up from the dead for 2 000 years and he's with us tonight then if he's with us at the time brother Brown say in 1964 where is he today where is he today where is he this morning come on don't get too intellectual on me don't overthink this one the same God that was with the prophet is now with his bride because she is the final Voice come on she is the final voice to the final age and under her messenger flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit life of his life she is him [Applause] hallelujah what is he trying to tell us things get out of this realm let's move into another round [Music] Hallelujah did you ever stop to think this morning as far as returning that is that he has become visible he's already here with us right now just imagine his presence as being here the Lord Jesus is in another world or another dimension but he's right here why is he right here he's a dimensional realm God he's here Elijah's God is with us today he's here not by your imagination he's here because the prophet said he's here he is here now he says the Lord Jesus is in another world or another dimension but he's right here today he's God he said well what is that how does that how does that work well who cares what you think I really don't care how you figure this one out because you can't figure it out it's my face his spirit is blending in with our spirit our eyes can't see him because they're physical yet unless there would be something happen that he could you could see him by Vision but he's here as visible and as real as he was when he spoke to Mary at the grave come on think about it that Jesus that spoke to Mary is right by you what do you have need of rabonai Mary what do you have need of listen if you've got a demon spirit this morning you should rise up and say I

from it saying come up a little bit higher things come up a little bit higher because there's so much more to obtain you know I I I've got it somewhere here people want prayer lines people want lots of things he says prayer lines and those are wonderful things he says but you know he says you can do it by faith you can get into that super around faith and there's nothing wrong with purlins I'm

I know you're happy about that it's been grand to be with you just to put our little shoulder to the wheel with you and to realize saints of God there's more to life than just coming to church and

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] probably never alone hey Jason praise [Music] [Music] amen hallelujah [Applause] thank the Lord praise the Lord [Applause] amen you know what praise is praise is the recognition of the existence of a God in another Realm that's what praise it it's it's it's saying I believe yes I believe there's another realm you know I I wrote that down here on my Note like he talks about there's two worlds what do we call this one world we call it the world the world right if you have a need the world goes to the world right they run to a doctor if when they find out that doctor can't help them then what do they have to do you have to go to another Realm the world has limitations God's got no limitation no limitation whatsoever not none he's got absolutely as the choir saying but but this world's got got limitations I think our trouble is so many times we go to the world when we got all the supernatural you need to look to we need to separate ourselves from the world and the things of the world you're you're in existence doesn't even come from the world the world hates you they don't even want you they're regurgitating you [Music] but I'm not of this world [Applause] I come from God yes and I go to God we are in this world but we are not of this world [Music] and maybe you find yourself this morning you don't feel you've made contact with this other Realm you know the baptism of the holy spirit is it's this realm making contact with you filling you putting it in you [Music] if you if you if you if you don't have that take a look around and say you know what I I've been dabbling in the world I've got World in me I got World thinking in me I've got World habits in me all you have to do is say father I don't want to be in this world I want to separate from this world and I want to have a taste of the realm what are these people jumping up and down going praise God why they make contact with the realms and if you haven't had that it's here for you to make contact with I don't I don't want to March out with the with the victors if there's one soul left that belongs in my March yep there's one person that belongs there that long and is hungry for a real experience with God religion and denominations that is Satan's counterfeit dollar bill [Music] for what's real aren't you glad we had someone show us the difference there's a formula to go from the world [Music] to the supernatural [Music] it's repent I'm sorry for the worldly things I've done not only am I sorry to him I'm sorry to you I'm sorry to all the people [Music] that I really should have been serving all this time [Music] I'm sorry Lord I repent and if you've never been baptized there's a formula that says if you'll repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ identifying yourself with his death burial and resurrection that you know and realize that he himself is the only one that can take you from the worldly Dimension into the Heavenly dimension and you are baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he made a promise he said if you repent and are baptized you shall receive the Holy Spirit you shall receive this dimension for the for those of us and you that have [Music] made that Journey [Music] why go back again you know what backflip means it means to slide back out of the spiritual Dimension back into the world back into your trust in the world your efforts in the world I thought our brother laid it out so beautiful to us this morning that this world will perish amen don't don't don't the scripture Jesus says goes on he says don't put your your Treasures on Earth well they are perishes but place your Treasures in Heaven well though neither grain moth or rust and where the thief can't break in and steal it from you right oh once you cross over he can never take it from you but it could be beautiful if we could just in our life start relying more on the supernatural world's got its limits he has none the world has to use things God's a creator he can create your healing he can create he can create everything you need foreign you have a lost loved one don't try to create some sort of scheme look to the Unseen isn't that what our brother said let's start looking to this other dimension let let the life and the word that's trying to bring this other dimension into a reality for us let us start turning all our heart there wouldn't you all agree don't let what we want for our little local assembly to be an assembly that relies on the supernatural assembly believes that God can do all things an assembly whose Hearts open for whoever would come into our midst and would like to take a drink of the Fountain of Life not a bunch of rules but an open Fountain of the Living God you can dress like the world or you can dress like somebody that's from this other dimension you want to represent as for me and my house will serve the Lord how many of you feel that way today amen Lord let the love of God be shed abroad in My Heart by the spirit necklace Supernatural dimension that her brother this morning so beautifully laid out for us Lord let that flow through me let it live out for me no man lighteth a candle put it under a basket but he setteth on a hill that it might not give light you believe in the Supernatural let's show the world that the Supernatural is available to them if you're here this morning and you know that you're not in this heavenly place you're not here we're a rapture is going to take place if you find yourself on the other side of the line and you haven't passed from Death unto life and you feel this morning that if brother Tom and the ministers prayed for you all right it would make a difference then we want to give you that opportunity I'm not talking about you got a need and you want to better this or a better that you have access I'm talking about someone that doesn't know that they know in their heart they're not part of this dimension and they want to cross over from Death unto life I offer you that opportunity like Jesus offered the young man he said thou lacketh one thing that you sell all that I have so all that you have and come follow me if you're here in that condition this morning and you'd like to follow him you'd like to give your heart and Surrender Your Life and have him come and take his Abode in you we want to give you that opportunity because I don't want to March out without you I don't want to Rapture without you oh God [Music] don't put it off if it's here if God's dealing with your heart if you know that you're not saved this morning and you know if he would come this afternoon that you'd be left don't be ashamed because every man that's ever come into this Kingdom has had to walk out of the world and make a public confession that I've accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior if you believe and you haven't had the spirit and you want the spirit of God in your life you can do the same thing just look to the Unseen this one has seen that this morning if anybody who's outside of the kingdom of God and outside of the security of the blood of the Lamb and opportunity to come to life the gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus let's just sing it Hallelujah as we just offer whoever might not know him who would like to come oh is he tugging at your heart good [Music] have you met him face to face [Music] or if you have just lift your hands and praise them [Music] oh Hallelujah [Music] oh Lord we praise you [Music] oh [Music] I thank you Jesus [Music] foreign [Music] whoa foreign [Music]

hearts to the Lord all right they wanted to go from the worldly realm into the spirit amen you know something I want to give a testimony I looked all around and there is no one No One Like Jesus amen
