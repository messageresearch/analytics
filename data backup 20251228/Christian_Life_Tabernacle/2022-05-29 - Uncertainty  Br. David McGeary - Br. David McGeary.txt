oh [Music] oh [Music] oh [Music] foreign [Music] this morning the promise will be with us even in us until the end amen but it's himself if i could just come and open our service in prayer and our song reading this morning certainly welcome everyone in the house of god in this memorial weekend god bless you good morning welcome to the house of the lord beautiful day that the lord has made [Music] david said we're going to rejoice and be glad in it amen be determined to rejoice and be glad i mean we're going to read out of psalm 149 we'll let brother mike continue the psalm 119 but you know i look at the congregation and there's nothing like the beauty of holiness a beautiful spring day we come together we lift up our voices together and praise the lord you know out of 150 psalms there's a lot of of exhortation and praise and and prayers uh supplications call upon the lord david and all his travails and victories the last five chapters from 146 on just giving over completely to praising the lord amen i think obviously the overcoming in our own lives the things we've gone through even in the midst of trial we want to praise the lord in verse 11 of 147 said the lord taketh pleasure in them that fear him solomon said it's the fear of the lord that was the beginning of wisdom not to be afraid of the lord but to respect his holiness his righteousness so there's definitely a reverence that we apply we come to the house of the lord but there's also a freedom in worship and praise so this morning each of us in our own way let's lift up that name and praise glory he's kept us he's blessed us and above all people of this earth we've been blessed amen if you don't recognize that we pray that you have that recognition amen even this morning and i look out and you think uh i just considered this the lord just dealing with you in many ways you realize that you have children that are growing up you love to see them blessed you love to see victories if you look at verse 4 so the lord taketh pleasure in his people you know as an earthly father or a dad you take pleasure in what your children accomplish even your friends children and uh we take pleasure in that but how much more a heavenly father realize that he's kept us he's blessed us but he has a desire for us to be an overcomer and i can ask how many uh probably over the age of 50 i'm sure know what uh pop bottle deposits are all about anybody remember that the young people probably don't but back in the day as they say uh the coke bottle we call them pop bottles in north arkansas was worth about 10 cents and uh you know littering was a common thing back in that day people get finished one day just throw it out the window so as young kids barefoot many of us poor we could scour the ditches the dumps and everywhere else you could find them for those pop bottles and we can take them back to the store and we never got much money we got a lot of candy and a lot of baseball cards for them but uh as you come in the store if you were gonna buy a a six-pack you had to have your deposit with you you had to have your empty bottles back with you or you got charged 10 cents a bottle extra for your purchase so it made sense people would yeah there's my deposit right there and they take that off the price of your of your new purchase and you consider that and you realize there's a redemptive value in that model because it was cheaper for the company and think of this there's a type here they could clean that up and sanctify and purify purified and refill it cheaper than they can make a new one the lord didn't do that with us but there's a redemptive value in each one of us collectively consider the redemptive value of this assembly brother graham taught us that each soul is worth ten thousand worlds oh my the lord can take pleasure in this group this morning and say that's my beloved surely we can give him praise he's very deserving of it he like i said even in the midst of the trial he takes pleasure when you can lift your head say thank you lord so let's read one psalm 149 together you know and briefly the last verse of 150 says let everything that have breath praise the lord but if you'll notice back in 148 praise them all you angels praise them all you host praise them sun and moon everything these things don't have life but they're still glorifying god the creator surely we that he has given life to we can praise him let's read together psalm 149 praise ye the lord sing unto the lord a new song and his praise in the congregation of saints let israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of zion be joyful in their king let them praise his name in the dance let them sing praises unto him with the temple and heart for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meek with salvation let the saints be joyful and glory let them sing aloud upon their best let the high praises of god be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand to execute vengeance upon the heathen and punishments upon the people to bind their kings with chains and their nobles with betters of mine to execute upon them the judgment written this honor have all his saints praise you the lord blessed by our heads gracious and kind heavenly father we thank you lord for just the ability to assemble ourselves together lift up our voices and give praise to our creator lord we ask that your blessings would be upon us lord that you'd come in our midst and lift us up beyond the cares of this world lord above our troubles and

him speak to us he believes he'll talk to you this morning amen that's because he loves you and he can do for you exceedingly and abundantly above what you can even ask or think and [Music] we don't deserve his love but yet he chose to love us amen so let's approach him this morning if you have something on your heart that you really desire [Music] i mean it's the deep down in your heart your heart top talks to your subconscious and it's something down in there that you really wish well i have a book here [Music] that says god give you the desire of your heart and it tells me to cast my cares upon him for he careth for us it could be a deliverance you need it could be a blessing it could be anything it's it's the it's what your heart's desire is a freedom whatever it is you have a promise that he will meet that need in fact he already knows it but he's waiting for you to approach his throne so would you approach him this morning as you pray as i pray [Music] and just say lord this is the desire of my heart this is what i really desire more than anything that you would do this or if you could do this one thing i'll serve you [Music] our gracious father [Music] we're assembled here from all over the world [Music] many languages are spoken this building this morning [Music] dialects from india and romania 13 14 countries in africa south america mexico [Music] many many places father the philippines father we could go around the globe [Music] and yet you know each heart you understand each language lord and we're coming to you this morning because we have no place else to go [Music] where could we go lord doubt alone have the words of eternal life and we're presenting the needs our personal needs and father the needs of the brothers and sisters that we've assembled this morning we're bringing them all to you today because you ask us to because you proved to us that you love us and as the father of our faith abraham so testified that he believed you were able to perform that which you promised and father that's what we rest in this morning is your word we ask you to bless each heart here this morning as we fellowship around your word in jesus precious and holy name we pray father also this morning lord there's a great tragedy took place in our country in our land father there's hurting parents today [Music] because they lost their children and they lost their children because our country lost you lord and i know there's no redemption we've passed the line we've rejected your voice but father may your kindness go out to those hearts father may you receive those children into your kingdom [Music] may you wipe away their tears and their voices of the hour that we live in we ask you to deal with our hearts this morning father also we recognize this day those many men that went off to battle to fight for freedom [Music] lay their lives down for our country or that this nation might be preserved for the only purpose of bringing forth your messenger and lord now that that's been fulfilled we see it falling apart but lord we ask that you help us today father may you bless this word to the people may they understand it may it encourage their hearts father if there's correction in it for some may they rejoice but father we commit this service into your hand in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen god bless you this morning let's open our bibles and turn to the book of the gospel of mark in the 13th chapter and we'd like to read the 29th 30th and 31st verse before we're seated this morning and have our bible lesson today we trust that we'll be able to put it together in a manner in which you can glean something from it that will bless your heart it says so ye in like manner when ye shall see these things come to pass know that it is nigh even at the door verily i send you that this generation shall not pass till these things be done heaven and earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away heavenly father we ask you to bless your word to us in jesus precious name we pray amen then you may be seated you know i i believe the desire of my heart as a pastor and i'm sure every pastor that uh approaches this congregation feels the same way but we want the best for each of you that's our heart's desire the best for each of you but as a church we certainly want the church to be all that it can be we want to live up to the full potential and the full expectation that god has for us i believe he's equipped this church to be the church that's prophesied that it would be amen do you believe that i believe that that we we're supposed to have in this day that there's supposed to be a church that has a book of acts written behind it there's supposed to be a body of believers that are empowered with the word of god in order to defeat the enemy on any ground any place any time and anywhere and we know that we're as even as the word of god tells us that we're approaching the end there's got to be the end the end of things many things are coming to an end and and we see those signs of it and so we want to uh pursue that path this morning but what in desiring that we achieve uh to a higher level it just came into my heart a little bit kind of like an automobile when an automobile isn't running to its uh perfection or it's running or something's wrong with it you know that it's not operating the way it should operate then what you do is you go back to the operation manual you know what i mean and uh you go search that out and you find out what are the causes of this problem what what what causes this to happen what causes a certain thing to happen and it doesn't matter where it is in the book some manuals are this thick and you go through that manual you'll go you just don't go to the back pages and read in the back pages you go to the place in the manual that describes the fix for the problem you understand what i'm saying so this morning i i i feel in my heart just looking how things are that uh what is what could it be that's keeping us from going to a higher level and i don't want to leave anybody behind you understand i don't want a small group of men or a small group of people that are all on fire for god that you're you're you just got this little burning bush i want the fire to be all through the church i want every believer to feel that they're a part of god i want every member to feel that they've got hope that they can touch the hem of his garment i want them to believe that there's a god that's standing with them that will fight for them and work for them so that our hearts desire is somehow to be all inclusive this morning to be able to gather everybody up and have them hear the word of god and find something in there that stirs their soul and moves them closer to the kingdom of god and and so going back and and i i just seeking the lord in my heart and he just seemed to lay this on my my heart and at the uh this certain uh sermon title and i went back and looked in it and i think within the framework of it i i found something and i'd like to share that with you this morning and and in the diagnosis of the of the problem the diagnosis was laid down early in in the message so we're going to go back this morning and we i want you to listen to 13 minutes of a sermon called the uncertain sound and it's preached in spokane washington and i'd encourage you to go back and maybe listen to it some time there's several he preached this message several times and usually when somebody is trying to preach something he's making an emphasis and to me it's kind of a turning a cornerstone kind of a turn where he's trying to present something to the church he's came out of the early stages of his ministry of taking people by the hands of discern he started the discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart and his message is moving now to the church trying to bring the church back into order that it can receive the word of god and then in listening to this i thought that it was like he led me to a place that's a beautiful description of exactly where we are as a country as a people and a lot of times as individuals so i don't know exactly how to approach this this morning what i want to bring but i thought maybe it would be best if we just listen to this 13 minutes now listen to this 13 minutes in light of not only what's happening in your personal lives but what's happening in this country the nation and the world i mean it's unbelievable to think what's transpiring many people are only concerned about their wallets and and and the fact that uh gas prices are so high and we all affected our our body of believers affects it i know what it's like when you put a dollar or two in the offering and it's so appreciated and now every dollar you have to go just goes in to get you to work and you don't have any leftover change you don't have those things we all suffer but we don't we don't mind the physical suffering we don't want to suffer spiritually we don't want to suffer spiritually because of the times that we're living in we want to be able to embrace those times we want to be able to understand the times we under we want to be able to recognize the day and the hour that we're living in and its message to us we want to be able to recognize the enemy at every single one of his tricks and we and by understanding what's happening and what he's trying to do to us then we can we can anchor in our place of rest and we can gain the victory so if our problem of god begins to speak to us and he began and we're just listening to 13 minutes of this this morning listen to the things that he's saying very carefully because he's talking about and he starts this off is he says now we're living in the day of uncertainty what a day and only a prophet can speak things you say well this was preached in 1960 yeah i forgot when the prophet gave his prophecy a virgin shall conceive that was 400 you know this is a few years 50 years later and it's so clear so may the word of god reach out to your heart this morning we're not here promoting a church we're not here promoting a system we're not even here promoting a profit we we read paul but we don't promote paul we read isaiah but we don't promote isaiah we read truth and we promote truth and that's all that i can ask you this morning is you listen to this you answer back to me is it the truth or not so let us just have a good sunday school lesson this morning amen do you love him i got something better than that he loved you first god bless you let's listen to 13 minutes let it be a blessing to you god bless you now we live in a day of uncertainty it's an uncertain time now i want to ask you something and as we i try to teach just for a moment and refer to these contexts here in scriptures i'd like to ask you anything that's uncertain cannot be trusted if it's uncertain you can't trust it paul said you're if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound how shall we prepare ourselves for battle now uncertainty there never was a time that things were so uncertain as today and anything that's uncertain cannot be trusted just remember that anything that's uncertain cannot be trusted if there's a question don't do it at all a lady come to me not long ago a woman on my own church young girl and she said to me they got some kind of a fashion out about girls wearing scandal skirts or something that showed the little piece up cut up like this that wore a shoulder underneath skirt and she said brother branham do you think it's wrong for us christian girls to wear a scandal skirts i said well you asked me that far she said i was just wondering i said if you question your mind don't do it i said if this question leave it alone you can't be certain dress the way you know you're certain don't take any chance i said by the way what would a that's what is a scandal skirt i didn't know what she was talking about and she told me what it was and i said what in the world would a christian girl want to show an underskirt for i can't understand that's right i just can't get that my mind don't make sense to me christ is our life all right now but if there's a question man come say do you think it's wrong to smoke what are you asking about it for if it's questioning your mind leave it alone or anything you don't do by faith is sin right you've got to be the face of how can you smoke and have faith write your own conscience shows you that you're wrong so if it's uncertain you better leave it alone because that might be the one thing that keeps you out of the kingdom of god or you say brother brown one little thing like that one little thing like that will do it just disobeying one commandment of god one little disobedient one commandment caused all sickness and look jesus said in his own texts and his sermon remember lots wise now she had a lot more uh excuse than what we have today doing the things that we do that woman's children and grandchildren was burning up in the fires of hell sent down from god and the poor thing screaming and crying going up there and she merely turned to look back and she turned to a pillar of salt and stands there yet today and jesus said remember lost white we've got to keep every word of god amen just one little thing that's reason sometimes people think i i get rough with people bawling out it's not because i don't love this because i do love you what if your little boy sitting out the street you said junior dear uh uh you shouldn't sit out there daddy don't want the you better strip the hot off of him if you love him keep him in off of that street real love is corrective genuine love is corrected what if your wife is running out of somebody man you say dear i hope you have a good time but really i don't think you should do she already kicked you out the door yeah real love is corrective that's right now uncertainty the american home today is uncertain a man marrying a wife it sure is a problem certainly is a woman marrying a man it's certainly on certain things they even got it in the marriage ceremony now i'll take him for better or worse there's a question on it uncertain be good to pray through on it don't you think so i think that would be better pray through but it's uncertain homes are broke up remarriage constantly all the time uncertainty of home life america leads the world in divorce cases all the rest of the world america leads it business uncertainty in business you don't know whether to start a business or not there's so much competition there's so much everything you don't know whether to start or not it's kind of questionable another thing is national life we don't know where to build a home or not might be blow up before morning you can't tell russia's standing there they got a uh a bunch of missiles set the only thing they don't need an army just one man with a little too much vodka to pull a line and we go to dusk no way he got set on everywhere that's all and remember we've got it for them the same way every little island every little nation's got us they don't have to fight any more wars just press the trigger and they'd stand enough bombs across your there'd be no way of stopping it you can't get away from it they'll blow a hole in the ground they got them hydrogen bombs that'll blow a hole around 150 yards deep i believe it is 150 miles square how would you ever get away from it the thousands of them set to explode at one time the world couldn't stand it and we roll there and hold up our fists they run back this way and run back is scared every nation is scared might as well like the white house we're like a little boy in the night time passing the graveyard whistling in the dark acting like we're big and brave but all behind everybody's shaking in his boots it's uncertain right our nation's treaty of pieces and everything else this is shaking the um's are shaking everything's shaking the bible said it would everything that could be shucked would be shut but we receive a kingdom it cannot be shown [Music] everything's shaking it's uncertain the seasons are uncertain you don't know where to plant your crops you haven't got some kind of irrigation the season's so irregular frost rain anything else can happen right in the summertime look uh once sometime here is having a freeze down in florida last year and a heat wave in alaska uncertain science says the earth is pushed out i forget how many miles is pushed out around the earth swelling out in the middle finland is almost one third or one-eighth bigger than it used to be a few years ago it's raising up the middle of the earth's are pushing out oh brother what is it the the red signals down he's coming be ready amen she's right at the door you don't know where to go to find security you buy life insurance how you know he's going to be any life from here after how you do you do you do everything but it's also just a gamma right so uncertain church life is uncertain churches denominations are so uncertain one don't know what to do with the other they're so uncertain until they're bumming themselves all together and going into the world council churches how are you going to do that when you mix yourself up with believers make believers and unbelievers people who deny the virgin birth deny the baptist the holy ghost deny divine healing and everything and yoking yourself up amongst unbelievers trying to do it for security security you know the bible said let the wheat and terrors grow together and he would funnel up the terriers at the end they are they're getting bundled up in one great big bunch all of them coming together to form the image of the beast an ecclesiastical power an image like rome oh it's coming don't you wear it it's going to be here and you're going to see it if you won't die at all age and none of you don't think till you'll see it we got the head of it sitting here now jezebel turning over ahab's neck and remember the days of that don't you i never heard my tape on jezebel religion scatters a whole lot you know what i'm talking about all right now uncertainty church life people belonging to church they're so uncertain they'll join the methodist this week is this it they're going to join the baptist next week go back to this and finally wind up in the catholic that's right uncertain they don't know where to go catholics running here and there and everything else nobody knows what to do just uncertainty whole thing it seems to be crumb no foundation but is there anything that's certain yes hallelujah [Music] is there something sure yes jesus said both heavens and earth will pass away but my words shall never there's something that's certain yes sir heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not pass away then that's certain one thing sure that god's word will never fail no matter how critical critics might criticize it how uh educationals might explain it away how they might do this that other but it won't stop it one bit it'll happen just the same as john said god's label these stones right children abraham god's going to do it his words are going to be fulfilled in their season and nothing's going to stop it i'm so glad of that oh how glad i am paul here was talking in corinthians 14 8 of training a soldier he's trained to a sound that soldier if he's a trained soldier he knows every sound of that trumpet just exactly what to do he's trained to that trumpet when that trumpet sound he said if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound then the soldier don't know what to do because he's only trained to the sound of the trumpet he knows exactly what to do because the trumpet sounded tells him what to do he said now the trumpet gives an uncertain sound then uh you don't know what to do now that was training a natural soldier and the christian soldier is trained to a trumpet a sound of a trumpet and that's the gospel trumpet the gospel the sound of the word of god the gospel trumpet and if one never knew the sound of the gospel trumpet he'd be a bit confused if he didn't know what the word said and what the word taught just what the church said he'd be a bit confused when he heard the sound of the trumpet he wouldn't know how to prepare himself and i think that's where we've got to the world today the trumpet is sounding exactly with the gospel and the people don't know how to act amen they don't know how to stand in line and make ready the battle they're confused because they have been listening to different trumpets creed denominations sectarianism all kinds of stuff and when the true gospel with the true word made manifest proved in that of people don't know what to do someone walks back and says it's it's a devil the other says it's uh telepathy it's um they're excited there's no such thing as the holy ghost dr so-and-so said so i don't care what dr so-and-so said what's the god saying that's the only thing it's solid his words will fail but god's word will never pass away this word's uncertain but god's word sure that's the reason i build my hopes on nothing less than that bible it's got to be that but it's strange as i go about and preach the word and testify that he's maybe taking a simple thing one statement of the bible use it's better to do that i could stand here for weeks and go a few things to show you that the scripture pointing right to this time and they don't believe it don't be mad at me you can go home and pick it up and keep listening makes you just want to keep listening doesn't because it's truth it's truth and so we want to approach this this morning and uh and so if you could see what the prophet of god saying uncertainty is a problem uncertainty is a problem and he said that in a battle and in a war and especially in those times that's how they communicated now today we would have a radio signal or we would have something that we would call out but before everything acted upon the trumpet and we even know scripturally that we're taught that the trump of god shall sound that is a that is a sign of the end the the trump of god uh sounding and so we as we listened and as we saw we saw that the reason that people are in the condition that they're in is because there is uncertainty uncertainty act and they don't know how to act and there's reasons for uncertainty there's things that cause uncertainty so if uncertainties the problem and and i feel that so many people are in this condition because that's what they're trying to do is the world is trying to create an uncertainty satan is trying to create uncertainty he's setting himself up people are uncertain about politics they're uncertain about uh we're uncertain about energy hey you know they're trying to say well gas price is so high we we have to turn the whole world over to a battery well i'm not ready to trust in the battery i don't know about anybody else and very you know i was thinking the other day i made the most stupid statement out of my mouth but i believe that god allowed me to to make that statement is i asked and they said we got an electric car and everything and i i said well will it charge itself while it's running well everybody knows that's called you know that's called perpetual energy there's no such thing so they're gonna it i'm just talking about the failure of man's mind okay so they're gonna they're gonna have batteries well you got to charge batteries you can't charge batteries with batteries so they're going to have to create energy somewhere to charge the battery so they're going to have to have nuclear plants or big coal plants or big gas plants or natural so instead of coming in out of your car it's going to come out of the manufacturer that's producing it what are they trying to create uncertainty because where there's uncertainty you can be sold oh this morning i i want is i want to get rid of my uncertainty yes sir and if i can help you with your uncertainty that's what i want to do today he says we know every scripture has a compound answer to it repeats itself certainly it does and we're in the day how we could take hours on that and show you just exactly the truth and you can't explain it to people and show it to people and they don't know which way to go that's uncertainty that's where he wants to get you into a place where you don't know which way to go he's trying to cause uncertainty satan is the author of confusion confusion is an attribute of uncertainty he that what he is wanting to do he says he says i'm one and one way you feel like you want to scold them yet you're sorry for them because they've been listening to something else that's contrary but always come back to see if it's thus saith the lord if it's the bible then that's certain and every ounce of it is certain not even one little phrase will ever fail as much as lot's wife right so like he said he said uh lot's wife would turn her head at her own screaming children and grandchildren burning up in flames of hell god's wrath and judgment poured upon sodom and and the poor little grieving mother just turned her head just think of that that that's that's the thing he he's saying just turned her head to look back but the angel said the angel messenger of the hour to their people said don't even look back and she disobeyed the messenger and just turned her head and she stands yesterday see friends that's the trouble i've noticed it amongst our people we just don't have the sincerity the reverence and respect to that word that we should have and that's the only thing that's going to stand is that word so that you understand that's what uncertainty does that you don't have the reverence you don't have the respect now because this is the argument of society today well that's not fair her babies were crying what did you expect her to do god expects you to obey his word he's the supreme authority but we don't have that respect we don't have what he says we don't have the sincerity we don't have the respect for the word you see say just trying to wash it down that's why all these people jumped up everywhere and started walking away from this message what were they trying to do they were trying to cause an uncertainty uncertainty breeds uncertainty doubt brings doubt don't even hang around with people that aren't certain of what they stand for but uncertainty that's what they do he says now and it and it it it shows that that they they were taught something they had something that was uncertain they didn't have a certain sound you know something that they they couldn't recognize the sound of the trumpet well in our day shouldn't we by now recognize the sound of the trumpet here everybody's sitting in uncertainty we don't know what what's going on nobody knows what's going on they're afraid the stock market's going to fall apart they're afraid that uh did he said it businesses are uncertain they don't know whether to start a business or not they don't know where to invest their money they don't know like that everybody's guessing because things are uncertain now we're talking we're not talking we're saying we're looking at the uncertainty and i hope that i can express this to you and try to sum it all in there but the church is going to be the church that it's going to be with power and demonstration that it's going to present because it's going to be the only certain voice in an uncertain time i don't care what disease they come up with somebody's talking about monkey pox or something now i heard the other day monkey pops chicken pox dog pops pig pox i don't care what it is there's still one certain by the stripes we are healed that's certain there's only one thing that's certain and that's god's word so you have to understand that if everything's uncertain that which is certain that which is certain that's what's going to stand true that's what people are looking at how can you say today certain when you got this church on the corner but teaching this one thing in this other church over here teaching this thing christianity is one of the most uncertain things you can possibly view if you're sitting on the outside looking in everybody's got a different idea everybody's got a different this prophet of god said its flavors is all it amounts to everybody's got a flavor what flavor do you want how do you want it it's called what a church just the way you want it drive up order your religion just the way you want it there's no certainty in that i want something that's certain i want something i know if i take this path i'm going to glory i want to have something that's real i want to have something that's genuine i want to have something that's positive i want to be certain of god and he's telling us there's one thing you can be certain of and that's my word this is what will remain i don't care how they paint it i don't care how they twist it what was truth in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god that's the thing that's the word what do you anchor to what have you attached yourself to what is it that you're getting your advice from he said that's the problem they didn't know the sound of the trumpet they didn't know the sound of the voice the voice won't stand up merely mining backslid preachers won't stand up against the spirit of sodom and gomorrah this day that homosexuality is of the devil it's a spirit that can be cast off a man or a woman what kind of voice is you getting today on that i don't care you kids in school you may have a friend you love her she's a good friend she's your best friend and one day she says well i don't know whether i'm gay or not you might laugh at it but there's guys in this building right here that are suffering with the same question you know it's true on the outside too lack of sincerity lack of commitment lack of an absolute voices what they did they've listened to an uncertain voice they're not certain of what they say why they have to they have to have a way out why because they don't know whether they're right or not it's the truth that's the truth they just they're just not they they just don't know what the voice is he says now if they doesn't know the sound of the trumpet doesn't know what he's talking about then he's a bit confused now today we find people confused look here presbyterians episcopalians lutherans by the hundred just coming and seeking the holy ghost that's right hundreds and hundreds denominational people coming up seeking the holy ghost and the pentecostal people they ought to know what's happening doesn't do it instead of grabbing and holding their congregations and shaking them down to the gospel they let them go right on living as luxurious as they want to when they don't know jesus said the sleeping virgin's coming to buy oil hundreds of people are seeking the holy ghost but you know why they can't bring them to the altar you know why they can't lead them to where the whole the fountain is you know why they can't share the experience because they're not certain themselves whether they got it they're relying on some kind of man-made evidence that they spoke in tongues and they know they spoke in tongues and they know they don't have power over the devil they know they can't lay their hands on the sick and they recover they know they don't got one ounce of anything but intellect because they haven't had a genuine born-again experience what is the holy ghost it's the change of your nature i wasn't free from temptation when i got saved i was still tempted in the flesh he was tempted in the flesh just like we are but i know one thing before i'd have stabbed you and took your wallet before i helped you up off the ground you brother mcgeary yeah praise god that guy's dead i didn't care about nobody but me and i wasn't sure about me think of it voices everywhere they don't know they don't know what what's happening they can't they can't bring them to a real experience so what are you gonna do if you're uncertain how are you gonna bring them to your uncertainty if we want to rise up if we want to be the church of the living god if we're going to if we're going to make good on our claim realize everybody that's sitting in here has made a claim i am the bride of jesus christ that's pretty heavy friend i'd rather have you honest i ain't no bride i'm here because if i don't come to church mama won't let me drive the car praise god that's the kind of people i like there are this local football team over here that claims they're america's team and hadn't won a game and i don't know many how many years but they had a coach one time i didn't like that coach he you know he took over tom landry's job i didn't like him i just thought he was phony as all get out and one day he made a statement and since he made that statement i like that man every day of his life he said i sold my soul for football i said amen that's the kind of man i like at least he knows he's going to hell right he stood for something there's no uncertainty in his life he was certain that he was gonna live eat and drink football all the days of his life make my coffin like a football good for him god you know gotta have more merciful on him then he would some lukewarm backbone person that's ashamed of the gospel that's what he said paul said i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ because it's the power of god unto salvation why there was one thing that paul lived for he said i've fought a good fight i've ran a good race now i'm looking to receive the crown that's laid up for me in glory he knew where he was going he was certain what he was living for no uncertainty in his life even the prophet when he went before israel he looked out at israel and his spirit was so disturbed he said why halt you between two opinions choose this day whom you're gonna serve as for me and my house we're gonna serve the lord god of israel how long are you gonna be halted between two opinions people are hauled because they don't know the sound there's a sound a trumpet was sounded to let us know that where we were and and what the hour is that we're living in if it was sounded can you say well it was it was that just brother branham was he's the trump of god he was the voice of the trumpet amen you understand the word was the trumpet but he was the voice of the trumpet but even if you didn't hear the trumpet is sounding many other places too it's sounding in society what do you think happened in avaldo texas that was the trump of god sounding out to this nation you've turned from god that's what happens when you turn for god amen what he said he said it would lose all common decency think of our country what a what a trumpet sound that you're listening why how would you be halted between the opinion of whether you're going to serve manna or serve god when you can look down the road and see that a man sat in a classroom for 45 minutes shooting kids that don't wake you up that'll make you shake yourself they're letting criminals out of prison they don't even keep them there they know for a fact terrorists are coming across our borders by the hundreds you say oh that don't bother me it will bother you when they start blowing up your shopping center when they start blowing up your schools when they start blowing up your bridges what's it going to take what's it going to take to move the uncertainty out of your life what's it going to take when you're going to give up seeking a career and making millions what's it going to take the trumpet sounded the trumpet sounding men marrying men oh i could understand that maybe in a political mind about taxes and our government gives a married couple tax benefits okay fine but it ought to shake our soul i'm talking about uncertainty okay they don't know they don't know the sound that the trump is sounding everywhere everywhere is everywhere we look is god screaming out i'm coming you can't go on this way crime in new york up 49 percent subway crimes up 26 percent just on the subway car thefts everything going up everywhere totally insane what bigger that audit we ought to be able to at least recognize that sign the world ought to be able to recognize that people that don't know god ought to be able to look and say there's something wrong here in fact every commentator that's talking is oh there's something wrong you know what they say every time you listen no these are uncertain times they were told this how long ago they didn't know the voice they didn't know the voice they didn't know the sign they didn't know the thing that was speaking out to to tell them see they they just they should know the bridegroom's coming he said and every every sign is right there and he says now there never been a time that we've ever known that the denominational world has been wanting the holy ghost until right now the evening light signs wonders and miracles and everything's setting right here ready sure they're a bit confused the evening light's shining they did he says but they're a bit confused they don't know they say oh hallelujah hallelujah going right on into it and letting everything run loose i mean just think what he's saying this is back then everybody's going after the charismatics everybody's coming up they all want the spirit of god all the television people want the spirit of god we all want the spirit of god now hallelujah hallelujah you know everybody wants the spirit of god they they want to speak in tongues they want the they want this oil they want this anointing did it happen right in front of our eyes and we didn't recognize it every television evangelist john hagee marcus lamb uh benny him even bob-haired woman preachers everybody wants the anointing they all want the spirit hallelujah hallelujah jesus jesus jesus they all run right into it that's what the prophet of god said it was a sign of the time it was the trump it happened right in front of our eyes and we missed it we've been kept waiting for the foolish virgin to want the oil we kept waiting for the foolish persians wanting the oil when did they come running in they came running in when the revival started under the ministry of malachi 4 5. that's when they started come running in no they all got the spirit they're all led of the spirit the spirit told me to do this and the spirit told me to do that and the spirit told me to do this and it be contrary to the word of god the holy spirit didn't even come to speak of itself but to bring you into remembrance of all things that i have taught and spoken to you i'm just moving towards something give me a little bit please he says they're a bit confused they don't know they say hallelujah hallelujah going right on into it and let everything run loose well we ought to be checking up they let everything run loose and notice they do this they do that they dress they do all the stuff that they're doing they they they're loose as a goose no sincerity no pulling their life in now we're talking about them okay because i have to look at you next sunday and i don't want to say you but you you look at yourself this is what he says well we ought to be checking up it's going up time amen we ought to be checking up it's going up time when that takes place when the sleeping virgin cries out for oil see it's going up time now are you certain it's going up time ask yourselves this morning have you settled that question in your heart and mind that we are at the end well let me tell you something someone said well brother mcgeary what happens if life goes on 50 more years does that mean we're not at the end i'm 72. you almost meant your end not too long ago if it wasn't for the grace of god brother darren you almost met your end if it wasn't for the grace of god brother almighty i don't see you but i know you're here somewhere there you brother i remember you almost met your end you don't look at the end of a clock you look at your end that's the end that you're dealing with are you right right now ready to go up right now or are you in a place of uncertainty okay in other words instead of checking up because you're certain that this is going uptime in other words you've heard the voice of the signs of the time the signs of the time are a voice jesus says look at the fig tree when it puts forth its lambs he says look at this look at the signs of the time we know by the signs of the time that i need to check up not for the world i need to check up for my time is my time right it's my life for the for the faithful time that god's given me when my day and my hour has come have i met the challenge of the hour that i live in it's got to get certain the evening light sounds coming on what is the evening light sound according to malachi 4 it's the message to restore the faith of people the faith of the fathers to the children a message now the question is do you know the sound i mean when i say that you you know and not that brother brown was a prophet not that this is what we believe and we love to say things that make us feel good or you're elected your name's on the books of life nothing can take it off nothing you put it on hallelujah hallelujah then live loose our lives testify louder than our words see this morning now we're not we're not talking condemnation we're trying to talk the recognition of uncertainty we've got to recognize uncertainty because there's an uncertain sound the world is giving out a sound that's not certain they don't know where they're going they don't know what they're doing they don't know how to solve their problems is there something certain yes it's the word of god now listen he says now the church didn't know him why because they they hadn't been trained to the voice he said they had been trained to the voice of the ecclesiastical system of the day and it was an uncertain voice they didn't know what to do when jesus walked out there and foretold things and prophesied things and yet their own scriptures telling them telling them that when he come that's what he would do they didn't know the sound no i i hope i can i wish i was a better speaker that i could use vocabulary and words to let this sink in god is playing a symphony for you with modern events he's playing a concert for you with the condition of the world and the fulfillment of prophecy in the beginning of plagues he he's showing us everything to try to tell us let's get certain about this message and about god's word because we're not going to rise up to be the church that we're supposed to be unless we're 100 certain and sold out on the voice of this age what is the sound of this age malachi 4 5. she said but they didn't know the sound and they didn't know what to do so here jesus shows up the very fulfillment of all their prophecies they didn't know what to do with them and he told them if you can't believe me for my words believe me for my works they're still confused which one of you can convict me of sin they couldn't lay a finger on this character they couldn't lay a finger on his works he said search the scriptures for in them you'll find that they speak of me i do nothing unless the father shows me yet they didn't they couldn't hear the voice they couldn't recognize the time they sat right there and was blinded well that ought to make us all very humble that he blinded them so he could bring it to you they were frustrated just holding something back i'd like to blast them talk about a frustration yes frustrated they didn't know what to do they said they they seen something happened and they know that they had to answer to their people and instead of taking the gospel and searching it out when he stood there and perceived their thoughts they just they was going to tell their people he was beelzebub they just cast it off oh it's the devil jesus turned around and said i forgive you for that but someday the holy ghost is going to come to do the same thing one word against it will never be forgiven the uncertainty and the certainty when a certain sounds the uncertainty uncertain is confused and when the uncertain sounds the certains confused until he sees where what's sounding yes you're an elect people there should be no uncertainty in your life a man knows where he's standing he can hear the uncertain sound but he won't listen to it that's right a stranger they will not follow all right what happened what made them that way why did they do it how did they do it they denied the word and when you deny the word there's only one thing to build upon and that's the educational system when the truth is denied education is accepted think of it when the truth is denied education is accepted now i want you to notice when a man's heart when a man hears the voice of god personally hears the word of god now you can hear it you say well god has come to to meet me yes sir i could sit here and preach till i fell dead in the pulpit 20 or 30 years from now you would never hear until god reveals the word to you you can sit right in your seat you don't have to be by a burning bush maybe you are closer than you think you are just sit there and let god speak to you in the word he can speak to you this morning you're closer than you think he says they don't either and they take the educational system in instead when they deny the truth education is accepted that's exactly right they took education instead of them experiencing we used to have experience we used to have with god we send our children over to school somewhere a phd in an lld and bring him home and he knows no more about god than a hot and tot knows about an egyptian night right we take our children we take our children to in sunday schools god don't have any grandchildren god has sons that's right but we take we take them in and say well they're pentecostal because their mother was pentecostal raised them pentecostal that don't make them pentecostal pentecostal is an experience sunday school don't teach your children you teach your children you talk to your brothers and your sisters about god i'm going to close with this and then i'm going to just finish i'm going to truth that's the reason we're losing now look at church we're losing is america what it used to be are our morals what they used to be is marriage sacred anymore they wouldn't they wouldn't use a three-letter word on television now vocabulary is wide open i don't know you know i wish i had more quotes on it but i thought what he said well there's doubt leave it out if you have to question it don't take a chance but uncertainty leads to chance taking i know all our kids want cell phones and i'm sure there's a lot of reasons to have cell phones and all those things but i don't know if the technology is there but i wouldn't hand a kid a cell phone that he could get on the internet and watch the stuff that's out there if you can help it i surely wouldn't give them something that's smarter than you are why don't you just hand him a checkbook or a credit card how many is willing to give your teenager credit cards here's a correct card just do whatever you feel bad you're not certain you're certain enough not to give them that well if you got to give him a cell phone set some rules up i think you can monitor the time it's on i think you can monitor the conversations i think you can monitor they want their privacy they want their freedom let them pay their own rent let them get their own insurance let them pray for their own education you know what parents we need to get some backbone and some guts because the word of god said the children would rule the parents in the last days how come all the people that didn't have kids amen no it's a challenge you know why you're uncertain uncertainty is a plague in the church right now it caused good men and good preachers who stood for this le this message for 30 and 40 years to walk away because they let a spirit of uncertainty come in they no longer were sure someone who's not sure is not committed that's the reason we're losing because we're we're taking our boys and teaching them education instead of the principles of the bible and the salvation of god and the power of the holy ghost that's the reason on this great revival we what we have done the assemblies have hatched out great big groups like oral roberts and other churches a church of god billy graham baptist and so far thousands and thousands but where is that church of christ spoke of where is that great powerful church of god he promised so that was what raised my question and and when i looked at the question and then i i saw within the same freak of the sermon is where is that church where is that church the church isn't there because the church isn't certain there's still people that aren't 100 percent sold out to this message just in case or because somebody else can raise questions they raise questions about oh the cloud and the seven angels he saw in it and everything i don't know where brother branham was when he saw it you tell me where brother brown was and you come back and tell me where paul was when he got caught up into the third heaven which epistle did he write you give me that time frame you tell me where he you tell me where philip was so when they can't explain it and they can't get revelation what do they turn to education education's got to have some logical timeline you're dealing with eternity where were you when the sons and daughters of god shouted for joy before the foundation of the world where was i before i was here when brother van's wife said what happened to your hair he says you tell me where they were before i got them and i'll tell you where they are now ain't lost to one of them they're somewhere ignorance uncertainty sows ignorance so we've had a certain voice we've had a certain sound we've had a message that's given us a a certain sound we know the sound so if we know the sound we know the word now we've got to understand i'm not going to amount to anything until i have an absolute until i can wash the uncertainty out of my life though i'm sold out because this is lady osea you can't serve manna in god the church that's going to rise up is the church that's heard the voice of god in this last day they understand this is true truth this is what's going to be we just listen to a portion of that tape things that are to be that wasn't things that might be it wasn't this is a possibility of what might happen uncertainty let's talk about uncertainty just for a few moments anything that's uncertain is unreliable and can't be trusted you know there's a great subject uh see if i can just find that great word that i i i want i want to use and it's it's it's what it's what they call i think it's called quantum mechanics me and joseph gordon are well versed in quantum mechanics they have to figure in quantum mechanics that's the study of small particles like electrons and atoms now they say that if you had a baseball and you threw the baseball that mathematically if they had all the data they could tell you where that baseball would land but they said a little electron you don't know what it's going to do and if you if it did go where you thought it was going to go you wouldn't know how it got there it's uncertain they're uncertain of what they do so they they built everything around uncertainty i think yeah this is great we got nuclear power plants and nuclear bombs and there's a whole a thing there how do you say that that guy's name right there starkling h eisenberg heisenbergs uncertainty principle that's science in other words the principle of something that's unreliable that can't be trusted and others are saying we've got to make provisions because we got something we're not certain of and we can't trust that's what uncertainty does uncertainty creates risk you ever heard of risk management management is why you pay what you pay for insurance because they're not certain of what you will do they're not certain of what's going to happen so there's a whole study of you take things that are uncertain is there any uncertainty in your business i thought that's why they had you there well if anybody can get rid of it you can't uncertainty you're living in a world we heard that's totally uncertain they're so uncertain they actually got laws and principles of uncertainty they're not certain everybody's going to drive down the road they're not certain of things uncertainty causes risk what did you hear the prophet of god say don't take a chance don't take a risk uncertainty causes risk because they're uncertain they know there's a risk i believe they call it risk and reward god doesn't have a risk and reward program he's got a certain program my word certain you confess me before men and i'll confess you before my father if your life confesses me before man i will confess you before my father if you choose me i'll stand for you if i start to work in you i will finish it till the end but uncertainty causes risk risk means there's a chance of failure there's a chance of something happening different than you thought would happen uncertainty creates risk uncertainty creates compromise you're not certain of something if you're not certain you're not going to make a stand so uncertain it creates compromise you're willing to compromise christians don't compromise we're talking about this morning is let's get rid of all the uncertainty among us either we're sold out to this message we're sold out to what's on those tapes we're sold out to what he said either that's the way it is or it isn't. but if there's one ounce of uncertainty you will compromise you will make decisions that this message would keep you from making but because it's not your absolute and you're not certain you will go out on tenuous ground you will go out and make risk and compromise because you weren't a hundred percent positive that that covers everything heaven and earth will pass away but my word will not pass away uncertainty causes choices without certain outcomes risk causes you to make choices you know there's a great study here and i won't go into all this but this is a whole study on uncertainty and the effects on mental health and you know what they bring depression back to the inability to accept uncertainty anxiety uncertainty their final conclusion is the effect of uncertainty runs deep through all mental illness there's a such thing as mental illness and i know you know and i know what and i appreciate doctors and psychologists and and all the people that are trying to help people treat it but i know what they do first of all they're trying to separate you from the problem and they may give you coping skills they may have you understand it but in this whole article on treating mental health he says the most difficult thing we have to deal with is the uncertainty of our diagnosis i like doctors who practice on you we think it's this we're going to take this out and if it's not that we'll take this out and we'll give you this and we'll give you that i don't know if this will work or not let's try it you're living you're living with uncertainty it's bread into us educated into us because when they reject the word when they direct what is certain they've got to take education and we've got all this educational out there trying to educate the church and give the church of the living god an educated substitute to god's the saint the lord we're trying to incorporate all kinds of there's excuses i don't know if he said it that settles it i don't know what it'll do to the world i don't know what it's going to affect i don't care how it's going to affect the job this said the righteous shall not beg bran [Music] you think there's an uncertainty if you quit your job because you can't live the word of god no there's not uncertainties and doesn't live in the lives of christians he said if i choose him he says choose you first the kingdom of god and all else will be added unto you how certain is that that's the kind of certainty i want i don't want to deal with uncertainty because uncertainty causes you to make choices that you don't know the outcome of you don't know the effect if you start missing services for work you don't know the effect of that on your life we don't know the effect of a lot of things but what i'm trying to say if this church is going to rise up to our very own testimony that comes out of our mouth that we're followers of this message i'm a follower of william branham as he was a follower of jesus christ paul said follow after me and he teaches the same thing why do i have to tiptoe around a bunch of deaf blind miserable naked people and don't know it because i'm uncertain of how they're going to treat me well let me tell you i can end that uncertainty they hate you they will kill you thinking they're doing god a service but where's your stand where's our certainty if you want people to come here so i can present them a jesus that they like i don't have to have to point you to any other place than where jesus was in this generation he was veiled in that ministry that's where you find the word of god because the trumpet is the voice of malachi 4 5 to this generation i am certain of it i am more certain of it this morning than i was 10 minutes ago i am so certain of it because everything that he said i can actually look outside of these walls and see it happening just the way he said it would happen what does it take me to wake up and stand up and say people there was a man here who could turn on the light it shall be light in the evening time [Music] but it causes compromising it you know what uncertainty does it restricts authority you don't have no authority if you're uncertain like the sons of cephas i thought they'd go over and cast out a few devils they weren't certain they were trying oh satan i adjure you in the name of paul i assure you in the name of jesus those devils looked at them and said hey you know something paul i know and jesus i know but who are you by what authority do you come by what authority do you lay your hands on the sick but what authority you do you introduce somebody to jesus christ by what authority do you cast out devils but what authority do you speak that you're the bride of jesus christ by what authority where's your authority if you're uncertain your authority is restricted it's limited how are we going to go forward as a body of believers with any big eyes or little use in here i don't want nickel ladenism i don't want every time somebody's got to be baptized we got to call the pastor because he does the baptism i don't believe it you win them you baptize them this isn't no sacred pool of bethesda back here take them to the creek take them to the pool take them to the river you've got authority if you're certain that baptism in the name of the lord jesus christ is the only scriptural way to be baptized and if you're not baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ you've been baptized in an uncertain baptism you can't find it in the bible anywhere where anybody was ever baptized in the name of the father son and holy ghost you can't do it but that's what uncertainty does it breeds all kinds of compromise it breeds all kinds of risk taking it breeds all kinds of decision-making uncertainty is the enemy of the church uncertainty paralyzes you uncertainty restricts authority uncertainty leads to imagination it leads to all kinds of things all kinds of thoughts if you're not certain somebody said something about you that's what the problem with gossip is it just breeds uncertainty it just breeds all kinds of stuff church let me tell you something we we've got the effect the prophet god said it this way the breath bride does nothing till she has thus saith the lord where do you get thus saith the lord from the word of god i hope i don't sound like a fanatic i'm not talking about you i'm talking about your enemy i'm talking about the spirit that's in the land today i'm talking about what satan is trying to do he's trying to create uncertainty he's trying to create doesn't know whether you make a decision whether should i buy a house should not buy a house you want to know whether you should buy a house pray through [Music] i've seen people that you know i've seen people walk on a piece of property with their hands up in the lord walking all over that you know and and you know i'll be honest i was fixing to buy it and here's the guy out there praying well i said what do you say i'm claiming this land in the name of jesus christ i'm going to build my house here i thought no i'm going to build the house here didn't even own it he said i'm certain you ain't got no money i'm certain god i'm gonna build my house here well i said well i'm certain i'm gonna build a house here we were both right there's no uncertainty to us there should be nothing uncertain in our lives nothing be certain of god be certain of god you're created to pray through and hear from god hear ye him get through the uncertainty if if we are in doubt leave it out clear it all out get it all out because uncertainty uncertainty leads to imagination leads to repetitiveness do you know that how many can somebody give me the definition of insanity to do the same thing over and over again and expect a different result uncertainty leads to you know why people sometimes pray and pray and pray for the same thing over and over and over and over again they run to the altar every time there's an altar call run to the altar they go why because they're not certain of what they got the first time they were there i don't care how many comes to the altar but please stay there sometime till you're certain and if you're certain now you can go through my life you can find out all the mistakes i've made all the sins i've made he says without sins a liar i've had tons of failures i've had done tons of things i knew better not to do that sin i've done there's things he's told me to do i didn't do that sin but there's one thing you'll never take away from me is i know he saved me i know he called me and i know i reap a lot of what i saw but i know that there's nothing that can pluck me out of the palm of his hand that has been settled i'm certain of it i'm certain of it we pray for things over and over and over and over again and the repetitive cause because we're not certain i never heard of abraham continually to pray in the bible to have a child he accepted it uncertainty leads to uncertainty makes liars people just lie away they don't know what they're talking about prophet god said they don't know what they're talking about so they lie if you tell the truth you never have to remember what you said so these are fruits of uncertainty well you look at the world we're in the world church but we're not of the world we're the only certain thing that's here you are the oddballs you're the ones that's holding the world together you're the only thing certain in this world is the word that god spoke for this generation you're the ones that have the truth you're the ones that have the revelation you're the ones that have the understanding because that's why you've got to understand this whole spirit of uncertainty that's coming into every one of our decisions every one of our plays this whole battle that we have with this indecision it's everywhere i got people coming to me all the time he's trying to eat away at the very thing that we're based on i don't care what happens to the world god said so that settles it the word of god remains the same it's truth i am the way the truth the life no man cometh unto the father but by me it creates liars they'll say anything none of them have a sign none of them have a wonder so what do they rely on get this they rely on education they rely on contacting your mind instead of contacting your seed and there was only one voice that could contact the seed of god in this generation and that was the voice of william miriam brown you're actually saying the name of a man over the pulpit i'm talking word it was word made flesh it was malachi 4 5 made flesh it was luke 17 30 made flesh it was revelations 10 7 made flesh as long as the word stays up there in some sort of floating place in the beginning was the word and the word was made flesh you are the thoughts of god made flesh are you certain of that now remember what we just read to you last week and we went through a great effort of playing it for you i know i just had it right here and that was things that are to be things that are to be what did you hear in things that are to be your life was pre-planned wow i wish my daddy would have told me that when i was one years old david your name is written on the land book of life your whole life is pre-planned by god you come from god you go to god you may have to suffer things but he knows his thoughts towards you he'll lead you through it all he will not lose you nothing can pluck you out of the palm of his hand the work that he started in you he'll finish till the end our whole life is free planned we were predestinated to be here and can i hope you can understand i'm saying you see this uncertainty that satan's trying to get to work in all our minds uncertainty about tomorrow uncertain about the economy and certain about our jobs uncertainty about a health uncertainty about our education uncertainty about this uncertainty about that uncertainty about that and uncertainty produces borderline believers it's what it does it produces borderline believers because they're they're uncertain and i i honestly feel with all my heart when you look out all mental illness all economy the whole economy look his uh the whole economics is all based on what they're not sure of when i read that i i sat back in my chair i thought oh great you can't trust nothing but him and he's given you a sound not an uncertain sound he's given you a sure sound he turned his back to the audience and he discerned the thoughts and intents brother brennan would turn his back to the audience he would look like this and say i see a woman right here going to a doctor she's sitting at such and such codon and such and such and her name's mrs bailey he says never has the church ever seen this in all the history of the church till this day they don't know what to do with it also they say oh he was taken off the scene or this or that or this or that anything that create uncertainty remember uncertainty is our enemy you've got to understand that there's no reason for any uncertainty in our lives as believers there is a truth to every question you have there's an answer you may have to pray through you may have to fast a little you may have to wait but never be driven by uncertainty uncertainty causes you to make choices that you don't know the outcome of it causes risk it causes compromise it makes liars if there's so many things that come but the greatest thing that the word of god does is it eliminates uncertainty the word of god eliminates uncertainty so i i felt led in my heart this morning church because i see this whole world just the way the prophet of god said it we're in uncertain times the world doesn't know which way to go or which way to turn but how many in here knows which way to go which is the way to go up that's the way to go the way to go is up i don't want to go out i want to go up i know who to follow i know where my heart's at i know where the word of god's at and i'm not going to be shaken i'm not going to let any uncertainty they may be uncertain the world may be uncertain medicine may be uncertain economy may be uncertain the weather may be uncertain everything else may be uncertain but the church of the living god is not uncertain they are certain of god they are certain of the word of god and they are not going to be shaken by the battle and the mind and the battle in your mind is a battle to create uncertainty if you're suffering uncertainty about things remember there is something that's certain you're not as far away from that burning bush as you think you are just take a moment sit down and hear him because heaven and earth will pass away but this word will not pass away the world may do whatever it thinks it's doing but what was prophesied is what's taking place and we can rest on thus saith the lord god bless you [Applause] amen god bless you that's all i stand this morning [Music] oh i've been changed [Music] and ever i found sure [Music] is [Music] for this
