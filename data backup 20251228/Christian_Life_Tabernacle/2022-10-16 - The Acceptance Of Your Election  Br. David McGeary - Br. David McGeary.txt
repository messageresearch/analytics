Lord may we just walk in your presence every day Lord we just love you and Praise You In Jesus Christ's name amen hey man good to be gathering the hearts of God this morning I want to welcome everyone I mean all our visitors it's good to see brother Gary and Sister Barbara God bless you we turn around and welcome someone is invited by the mic for a song reading this morning amen God bless you good morning you can go ahead and be seated for a minute and we'll uh while you're turning to Psalm 16 this morning one of the few benefits of doing the psalm every week is you get to pick your pick on your favorite Psalms a lot so we're going to turn to Psalm 16 and you know I didn't get very far as I was reading through this but there's an interesting passage it says a statement that David makes is where we look at verse two he says O my soul thou Hast said unto the Lord Thou Art my Lord my goodness extendeth not to thee you know here you've got David you know speaking of the witness of his own soul you know something within him speaking out to the Lord and you know I thought that was odd's statement for him to make to be talking about his goodness you know when he's speaking with the Lord it seems like a funny thing to dwell on my goodness when when he's crying out to the Lord and you know the scriptures speak frequently of the goodness of God and they constantly remind us that mankind has none you know David says in Psalm 14 and again in Psalm 53 there is none that doeth good you know Paul says in Romans 3 12 he tells us none that doeth good no not one you know in Jesus himself when one came to him and called him good master responded in Matthew 19 17. why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God you know so it's kind of interesting that he would talk about my goodness you know and this is one of those scriptures you know in the King James where the old English way of saying something doesn't translate well in our new English speaking the way they said things was different than how we talked today but you know when you boil it down to the original Hebrew all he's basically saying is you are my goodness Thou Art my Lord and thou art my goodness you know I don't in fact it's just the old English way of saying I don't have any goodness to extend there's nothing no goodness to extend except for the you know Thou Art my goodness you know and that got me thinking about goodness being good works you know we say things all the time you know that's a good person or you know that that's a good thing that they're doing or that's a good work that they're doing but you know as the scriptures told us we have no goodness mankind are not good people and you know we we don't even have the ability to have the right conception of good outside of the good one you know we've had a skewed perception of what good is ever since we first partook of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil we don't have we don't know what good is we don't know what goodness is you know we live in an age where everyone seems to be talking about or trying to show how good they are you know that their work their cause their skill their accomplishment is good or that theirs is good and someone else's is not what feels good is good you know Proverbs 26 says that most men will Proclaim every one his own goodness but a faithful man who can find you know goodness is an attribute or a characteristic of God not man no goodness is the effect of his presence of his work not not some good thing that I have done you know goodness is the evidence that God has been there because he's the good one it doesn't come from what I do it comes from who I've been with or from who's been with me you know religion tends to focus on how good I can become how much goodness I can have you know and that you know depending on how good I am I can be in the presence of the Lord and then the devil is always trying to do that battle in our minds that we don't have enough goodness to come into the presence of the Lord but the truth is goodness is the result of being in his presence not the prerequisite for getting in his presence goodness is a result of being there not a price you pay to get there you know it's his quality goodness is his quality it's in in Exodus 33 when Moses was up on Mount Sinai and he was there with the presence of the Lord the Lord told him in Exodus 33 19 he said I will make all my goodness pass before thee and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee he says in verse 20 you cannot see my face but I will make my goodness pass before you he is known by his goodness in fact Paul says in Romans 2 4 he says don't you know that the goodness of God leadeth you to repentance David said three times in Psalm 107 oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men in Psalm 144 1-2 he said the Lord was his goodness goodness is not something we have it's something he gives you know in Psalm 21 David speaks of being prevented With the blessings of goodness in other words receiving so much goodness from the Lord that it's actually more than he can handle in Psalm 23 he speaks of the Good Shepherd surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life speaking of being pursued by the goodness of God and in Psalm 107 9 he speaks of being filled with goodness we know from Galatians 5 and Ephesians 5 that goodness is a fruit of the spirit it is just like Faith just like peace just like Joy it's a characteristic of him any goodness I have is a result of his hand on me you know even his definition of what's considered a good work is different than what we have you know in John 10 in spite of Jesus doing many good works the Jews were trying to Stone him because it didn't agree with their religion which they thought was good his Works were not good you know and it was in Matthew 26 9 when Mary took that expensive ointment and began to wash his feet he called that a good work instead of taking that ointment and going out and feeding the poor which is what others would consider to be a good word you know you could do a whole study on what the scripture actually calls a good work but I was thinking is also as we turn to Psalm 16 we can go ahead and stand David makes the statement my goodness extendeth not to thee but to the saints that are in the Earth and to the excellent in whom is all my delight any goodness I have isn't for him and it's certainly not for me but it's for someone else it's for what he calls the Saints those who are set apart for him and for the excellent the unusual ones because his goodness by which he is known is not the result of my good works but because he's passing by and they Rejoice at his appearing you know so as I was reading that it just struck me you know first of all if you see any good goodness in me then thank the Lord because the good one has come by and I just pray that the good one is able to extend his goodness to me and through me so like I said that's as far as I got but let's go ahead and read that together it's a beautiful Psalm Psalm 16. it says preserve Me O God for indeed do I put my trust O my soul thou has said unto the Lord Thou Art my Lord my goodness extendeth not to thee but to the saints that are in the earth into the excellent in whom is all my delight their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another God their drink offerings of blood will I not offer nor take up their names into my lips the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup thou maintainest my lot the lines are Fallen unto me in Pleasant places yea I have a goodly Heritage I Will Bless The Lord who hath given me counsel my Reigns also instruct me in the night Seasons I have set the lord always before me because he is at my right hand I shall not be moved therefore my heart is glad and my glory rejoices My Flesh also shall Rest In Hope for thou Wilt not leave my soul in Hell neither will thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption thou will show me the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at thy right hand there are Pleasures forevermore I'mma have your seats amen it's good to be in the presence of the Lord amen oh Christ Our Redeemer died on the cross who died for the sinners [Music] [Music] I said of life [Music] [Music]

school this afternoon man um there was a couple of emails sent out for uh sister Mark the young nephew Fabian Benavides who's back in the hospital with cancer was certainly going to continue to pray for him and man we've received a message that says even cancer can't stand him and I believe it's the belief is desire to seek for that and to make sure that God can move on the scene for him and also by the David Salinas who passed away who want to remember his family pray that the Lord will be with them and comfort their heart amen please pray for brother Matthew and the family as their way traveling for two weeks and they have service this morning at brother Craig boar in Connecticut a certainly pray that the Lord will give them a wonderful service a man man the purpose of preaching is to draw the souls to God a man that he may move on the scene and certainly do for them if you haven't eat upon your heart this morning man just lift your lift your hand after him and the brothers that are taking the offerings if he could come amen amen let's just bow our heads our gracious father we bring this needs before you Lord father you are the God of all might and power there is nothing that escapes you and where your children are coming before your throne Lord and father we desire to see your manifestation in our midst Lord you promise that not only you will be our God and you'll be above us you'll be with us but this end time you promise to be even in us oh god father you said the works that I do shall you do also and father what we desire is to conduct ourselves like you did oh God and Father when the enemy comes in like a flood the scripture says that you have lifted up a standard that we can walk in and claim our god-given rights and our position in you Lord and to be able to know that this is not supposed to be this way and we ask this morning Father that you may just move and father heal the sick and Afflicted in our midsole God and Father Comfort the hearts that are mourning o God and Father God whatever the need was are behind the absolutely lifted hand Lord I believe that these are the opportunities that you can come and show yourself for who you really are you know so God and Father just be with us to this morning and father we commit our pastor into your hands as you will come and preach the word Lord and father the word is life to us and I pray that you

past the Realms of flesh [Music] that we could look into the heavenlies that we could rise above the burdens that we have and taste of your goodness that we could come to a greater understanding of your love for us and the Bounty and the benefits that you want to provide us father there's a dark times but you said you would not leave us comfortless but that you'd be with us even in US father and that's our hope Christ in US is the hope of glory and that's what we trust this morning that you'll be our portion in Jesus precious and holy name we pray amen amen God bless you this morning if uh if you have your Bibles let's turn over to a scripture uh thank you musician certainly enjoyed that this morning we want to turn over in our our Bibles to a couple scriptures this morning and uh let's turn over to Galatians this morning and we want to read as many of you uh have heard uh several months ago a brother that believes this message he lives in Washington and he came over to his family and introduced his his brother-in-law and his sister to the message and his name was brother the brother that he introduced to was his brother-in-law so his sister's husband so he introduced the message to them they accepted the message and they started to attend our fellowship and because of his work schedule he mostly came in the evenings and with us in his name was David Salinas and he probably have heard that he had a work related accident and he lost his life on the job uh they're a young couple they have two young children and so this morning after service we're going to have a basket in the back or the offering box in the back if you'd like to give them an offering to help them out in this time and as they go through this very hard time of all of a sudden not having her husband children without a father you the you just get to that place you don't know what what am I going to do you know what I mean and when you can come around them are are Hispanic speaking brothers and sisters have been over there comforting her uh spending time with her uh letting her know that you're not alone that we're here with you and as a body so I believe they may have the funeral here at church we don't know what the arrangements are but if you if you want to just write a check out just make it out to Christian Life Tabernacle put it a love offering you can I guess first uh uh the salinases are are and we'll know what it's for and then we can transfer that into cash and and get her an offering if you'd like to leave cash just put it there but we certainly don't want to forget them in this time we want them to know that we're there for them even though many of you didn't get a chance to meet them lovely lovely people and we certainly our heart goes out for them so just a sorrowful time but anyway so that it's let us read here in the scriptures and we're going to read from Galatians 4 and then we're going to switch go back from Galatians 4 we're going to jump over to Galatians 27 and finish the chapter and and uh just trust the Lord will bless us this morning it says now I say that the air as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all amen now if we have our our title for our our little thought this morning it's the acceptance of your election okay so uh this is a beautiful scripture he says but is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time has come God sent forth his son made of woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that they might receive the adoption of sons and because ye are Sons and God hath set forth the spirit of his son unto your hearts crying Abba Father therefore Thou Art no more servants but Sons and if a son then an heir of God through Christ isn't that beautiful amen 20 let's go to same chapter verse 27. as it is written Rejoice thou bearing and that beareth not break forth and cry thou that travaileth not for the Desolation that hath many more children than she which hath and husband now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of promise oh my God isn't that beautiful so who are you your sons children of promise but as then he that is born after the flesh persecuteth him that is born after the spirit even so it is now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the bonds woman and her son for the son of the bonds woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free amen Heaven father we ask you to bless your word in Jesus precious name we pray amen amen God bless you may be seated the uh if the brothers in the back we're going to be uh reading and speaking a little bit this morning out of the message that seed is not air with the shuck and uh we just trust this morning that it would be uplifting you know in our our heart's desire is is never to take a negative approach against the gospel I think that you know you can uh it doesn't do any good to preach against a lie and keep preaching against the lie because really all you do is you propagate that lie it just keeps going but the best thing that ever answers a lie is the truth and so there's a lot of different things a lot of uh things that go on a lot of ideas that are spoken uh different people have different comprehensions of different things different ways of doing things but we know one thing about the Lord God only has one way of doing things and he does everything by his word and he interprets this word by bringing it to pass and so yeah you know you can spend a lot of time trying to correct air you can spend a lot of time trying to piece things together but you find out that if you just uh speak the truth that those that are for ordained to hear the truth will accept the truth and they'll live by it and because you don't want to create hard feelings you know there's a lot of churches out there there's the Methodist there's the Baptist Presbyterians all of them have different ways doing things but I want to have the love of God in my heart towards them all I uh even our messenger said I'd rather have a church that loved one another then all the gifts operating in their midst I just want that real love and I think real love is generated uh the very first part where Love's really generated is from the word of God the word of God but I love how this scripture starts it says now the air as long as he is a child differ nothing from a servant though he be Lord of all right and so you you have somebody that I I just I love this so much he says you could have the air of all the King's children but they're they're nothing separates them as long as their children in other words it's the maturity that that separates us and so and that's what he says but he says so as long as they're children and we're talking to today about accepting your election and as long as you're a child then you you you you don't differ you're in the same struggles you're in the same problems you're subject to the same things that the servant is subject to but you're not servants in fact your sons and daughters of God you're elected you're chosen you're Heir you're heir to all and so what were our heart's desire is is that we can come to the place that we can accept our election or our inheritance because that's what goes with our election is our inheritance we are joint heirs so therefore we are heir to everything that he was we and that's what he did for us he made us joint air you could look at him and see how that he acted our lord Jesus how he conducted himself how he approached things how he handled things in fact he was the master of every situation and Circumstance that he came in contact with he was in control now this morning this is what you're heir to your heir to what he is and in John I love that scripture John uh 4 and 17 first John 4 and 17. uh we could just uh I'll just read that to you real quick he said herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world now I I don't want just to look at that as a uh as a desire in our heart to be something because so much of us in Christianity we approach things like this is my desire to be this I want to be like him that's my goal is to be like him but if you can look at that from a different standpoint it's not a standpoint of a desire or a learning a yearning or a hope or some form of achievement that all our Christianity is is this great effort to to reach this achievement and to to achieve something and to uh work our way towards something and to live for something and if we can master this achievement then we're Christians so it's a it's a labor it's always a labor but this isn't he's not saying this is a labor or a goal of achievement he's saying because as he is so are we in the world this is not a labor or a goal it's a positioning you understand if it's not we hope you make it there it's I've elected you and I've chosen you and I positioned you that as he is so will you be if we could accept this now that it's our allotment right it's our entitlement it's our inheritance in other words when God in his great program when and we know what his word is when he spoke it in the beginning in the beginning you were a part of him and he had a place he had a a creation that he wanted to bring forth and so in every age he elected people to fulfill that role to manifest that uh expression that he was making for that time and so he elected a people to to be there at the end through the desire that he put in their heart the life seed that was in their heart and the word that was spoken and every time when the word was spoken it ignited something in the heart of the believer that caused them to think a certain way to act a certain way to have a certain desire and a certain Pursuit in their heart they were LED without even knowing it without helping it the prophet said things that didn't make sense people made choices because they were so compelled in their spirit because they the very life that they they lived and the choices they were making and the way they were thinking be even beyond their total understanding was the expression of what God was trying to do now God's trying to do something in our day he's trying to bring a people to a certain place and he's Chosen and elected people he's chosen a people that he can manifest the expression that he wanted for the day and the time that he allotted it to talk I don't believe God's dead I don't believe that we're serving the historical gospel but I believe there's a God that is trying to express himself that has something that he's predestinated and prophesied and and is wanting to accomplish and manifest now he's elected a people to do that and the way that God works so he he he has uh he he has an election and it's not an election without a purpose it's not I'll just choose you I'll just choose you I'll just choose you and I'll take you to heaven no God's got a purpose in everything he does so in in his choosing he didn't he didn't choose you and say okay I Choose You I'm going to set you over here you're now in my my uh salvation basket you know you're chosen you're here it's over okay and I Choose You and I choose you and all you that are chosen um your your over here and that's really uh that's nice to believe you know that's like saying all you have to do is confess that you're a sinner and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior and you're saved but Paul didn't want that to happen he said show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my works now he's saying I'll show you my revelation because my works are the predestinated works that God had for me now I've it's been revealed to me and now I'm going to express the love and the Salvation that God's manifested in me to bring me forth that I have a purpose so our election for our day and that's what we want to we want to grip and understand it's not the election for the other days not the election there was a people that were placed here on Earth that were elected and chosen to sit within the Frameworks of the meetings when the messenger of this age was broadcasting his message so there had to be a here and that word went out everywhere kind of went around the world seven times it was preached and it was expressed and it was manifested the anarch was Vindicated so there was a an elected group of people that were hearers and they heard it and yet and that's good and they believed it and and some doubted it and some fought against it and it was undeniable to others um many people took uh exception of many travels hundreds of miles to be in every meeting they could every time God's word Goes Forth there's a separation and there's a a manifestation the unbelievers manifested the make-believers manifested in the Believers manifested every time God's word Goes Forth there's a separation taking place even in our own lives every time the word of God Goes Forth there's a separation that takes place in us we should be separating ourselves farther from the world farther from the world farther from the world but there there comes there's a Time where it's not what's spoken it's not what's received but it's what's brought into manifestation because the word was spoken to bring forth a manifestation oh that's where the question comes in because we're humans and and the I have to say this humbly but a lot of times the biggest plague to the church is the ministry because the ministry wants to Force a manifestation or a product this is what we want what we've heard to produce I want the word to produce this I want the word to produce that and there becomes a variance a lot of times between what some ministers feel the work you're produced and what other Ministries Ministries thinks the word should be produced and then the people a lot of time get caught in the middle where some say well this is the anointing this is the move of the spirit this is the great working of God and everything and the people are going oh I want you know I want to be a part of that but there's something special about the elect and that is my sheep here my voice so God is always provided a way to bring you to Perfection and to manifestation and you've got to come to the place in your heart that you're settled on what that voice is and what it is that is moving you and that's why we could we have to understand that we've got to move to a great place of maturity and the exception of your election is the beginning of your maturity because as long as your as long as your uh a child you differ nothing but after you've had tutors and we we know that in our Bible teaching right the great Tudor was the Holy Spirit and the word of God the word of God continually bringing to your place tutoring you don't do this don't do that separate yourself from this separate but the purpose of it is is to mature you and then when you come to that labor level of maturity then you're no longer servants okay there comes a time as long as you're being tutored you're us you're a servant to that tutor and there's you he's continually teaching you continually teaching you in other words it's like being an apprentice you're being taught you're doing this you make your mistakes they teach you this they teach you that but one day you get that certification you get that card you're now you're a journeyman or you're a master you know what I mean okay you've got it well you you're not subject anymore now you can go perform your trade you can perform your task you know when you're an apprentice you can't be caught on the job alone do you have to have a journeyman with you you have to have a a Master with you you have to have somebody that's there that's continually watching you and testing you and trying you to make sure you do this as you come across different circumstances they're there to say do it this way do it this way I help you with this help you with that but and now God's looking at his church and he doesn't want to have to continue to tutor it he doesn't want to continually to have to anoint it anointed anoint it anointed they don't go by the anointing anymore they go by the maturity of their election I'm called to do this I'm chosen to do this I've been instructed to do this I can I can do this now give me the pipe bender I'm going to bend this stuff I'm going to put this stuff up give me the panel I can put it in place hook it up I know where it's going I know what it's going to do I can find the problems I'm certified God's trying to certify his church he's trying to certify his pride this is my certified bride may I say it humbly but he wants to move it out from under the instructions if I could even say this of preachers where we're Forever Learning another never coming to the realization of the truth but he wants us to be certified genuine Craftsman men and women of the word of God men and women certified as Christians sealed with the seal under the day of their Redemption this is my bride this is my elected person well it would be like going through all school and I and going through everything and getting passing all your grades and now you come up to get your diploma and and the master sitting there to hand your diploma and and you have a a a a a a a meltdown of complex you have a meltdown oh I don't know if I'm able I don't know if I'm I'm I I can do this I I I got a lot of problems and a lot of things and but the whole idea and the understanding of it is is that you have the ability because of your tutoring to fix and work through your mistakes I blowed up a lot of stuff as electrician I Buck faces on a 800 amp breaker you ought to seen that baby go off boom lights flickering I shut down the whole First Baptist Church of Euless I never should have fixed it did I make the mistake yes but did it was did I have the training the tutoring the understanding of to find the mistake to fix the mistake and to overcome it but I had to accept my responsibility I had to accept my position I had to accept who I was and the problems and mistakes I might come into them but I've got the goods to fix it it's called maturity it's called the understanding that I've been separated I've been called out I've been made different I'm not moved by every wind that blows I'm not moved by emotion I knew a man one time first thing he'd do you come on the job you ask for a job you look at your hands if you had some silky smooth hands he just didn't really care for you much you know he only hired people with calluses I said well what happens is that he says I want people that work he said well what happens if they if they don't know how to work he says I can train them if you got somebody that's always wanting to do to protect his hands we got to move past protecting our feelings so this is what we're talking about this morning I want to read you a little some statement I want you to walk with me I want you to understand I know there's a lot of emotionalism going on today I know there's a lot of questions that come come in about gifts and about operations of the spirits and about prophecies and about those things at which none of those things I heard Prophet God said many times that's all right that's okay you know it's it's okay but that isn't it okay so let's go let's see just for a few moments this morning what is it that he's trying to bring David McGary to what is it that he's he he's his goal is or if I could say this what did he have in mind for me in the beginning what was it that he wanted me to be now if I'm his right and I've been purchased then my position is to be as he is so as he is so am I in this world and so that's what he's trying to bring us to and he's trying to bring us to that through tutors and not just tutors but the tutor so look I want if Brothers if you would turn with me uh or if you would go in the message the seed is not air with the shock and let's just start okay and one book is paragraph 54. and uh I think it might be a different paragraph it depending on what book that you might have but now we're wanting to find ourselves here so when I talk about accepting your election accepting your election is not the fact that you're chosen you understand it could be like a basketball team so the if I chose you and I said to you uh brother Benoit I picked you on my team now wouldn't the first question you have what position do I play I mean I don't want to be on the bench well your position's the bench I have a cup of coffee over there and I want you to make sure that nobody touches my coffee I want you to keep it warm wait a minute I I'm a player you know I don't want to be on the bench so I I don't want to just make the team I want to know my position I want to know the part that I'm supposed to play I want to know I want to know what the plays are you know you have a football team brother Brandon used football so I'm okay there there's you got first string you've got second string you've got different people that's because people get hurt and people got to step up you know if you get your helmet knocked off in football you got to put somebody's got to take your place somebody's got to come in that knows the position knows the plays well we're on a team where everybody plays all the time because who we're fighting against is the devil Soca the exception of your election is no longer dealing with the hope of making it or battling with the fact you are elected when you accept your election you understand that the very election came with a position therefore an adoption you're under tutors but when you mature you become Sons and now your heirs to what that he has set aside for you from the foundation of the world he has had something for me not for the church not for all the Believers not for quote unquote message some anointing that sweeps over the whole group that we're all part of that's fine but if within it all there's ever eternal predestinated thought of God that's designed only to be manifested in me you can't take my place it's mine it's not ours I've got mine but thanks be to God you've got yours and yours and mine fitted together becomes a beautiful body of Christ Jesus and any in an eternal manifestation of the thoughts of God brought into perfection oh I like that he chose me he's got something for me he says this is paragraph 54 because this is you know this is a story of Abraham in Ishmael and and Isaac and and the whole election that Paul refers to in Galatians he says here we are predestinated with a picture here we are presented with a picture thought so you under isn't that a statement here here we are presented with a picture thought the seed started the seed of Promise started in a slightly doubted doubt of the original promise see how it started low in doubt in the original promise God promised Abraham through Sarah to have this child but now watch the first Seed of Abraham by the bonds woman come by Sarah doubting that this could happen because she was old and passed in age of bearing now that you understand that is a a a bride that looked at her flesh and didn't think that God was able to perform his word because of her fleshly conditioned but he settled that and not only that you had a fleshly condition that you would have continued to live in doubt if you don't accept the payment for that fleshly condition s and so we will jump down to uh that that's all wonderful reading but let's jump down to uh paragraph 59. that's where the trouble is today you cannot make a denominational chicken believe with an eagle it just can't do it there's where the Trouble Comes you've got to believe every word of God now remember this is this maturity this election what is he wanting for this day what did he predestinate for this day what did he elect this people for what was the purpose to believe every word of God not to have a rabbi come along and carve out just a portion of the word for you to believe or another Rabbi over here said you've got to have this feeling Earth this emotion or this Revelation how many of them I've seen since I've been in the message every Every Soul four five six eight years there comes a movement along and everybody does the Jericho March like they're fiction to March off into the rapture then the leader perishes the fire burns out and they find themselves right back thank God you know where they find themselves right back right back sitting in front of the message of the hour where once again that can go to the storehouse and be led where did I jump to what what paragraph is that 59 okay gotta make sure okay 59. okay okay it could not be air with Ishmael the seed of the Bond woman because of the doubting Sarah doubted God's word that God was able to keep it notice Abraham you seek what I'm building to for Sunday morning Abraham did not doubt it Sarah doubted it she was the one it was not Adam that doubted it it was Eve that doubted it so then we find out one out more about this as we pick it up Sunday morning neither can the spiritual and the natural be Heir with the spiritual no American ishmael's children be heir with uh Isaac's children no more than the carnal can be Heir with the spiritual Church natural Church spiritual there is a church that there is a church that these women here type and there's a church spiritual also so the natural church and the spiritual church cannot be errored together they're two different separate times two different separate people under two different separate Covenants do you understand so you're an elected people an elected Church in a different time under a different Covenant separated and not heirs with the church that went before if it's not it's a coming out it's an exodus it's a complete leaving of the religious systems and those things which have gone on before moving into a divine spoken maturity that's bringing you to a place that you that it could take some faith to believe that you can come to the perfection that he's predestinated you to and you're going to have to leave the doubt of yourself behind you can have to leave the flesh behind My Flesh howls at me the flesh Wars against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these two are contrary to one another when I would do good evil is present with me when I do that which what I'd want to do I end up doing that when I would not but praise be to God we've had one that's made a propitiation for us we have a sacrifice that allows us to separate ourselves to the Flesh and begin to move into the maturity of God's word two different people separate people under under two different separate Covenants now listen to this statement as we read that's why the Rapture is different and will only be for the Royal Seed of Abraham wow you don't think you want to settle your election the Rapture is only for the Royal Seed of Abraham I'm not going to go into this Rapture with the hope so I'm going to go into this Rapture knowing that I am the inheritant of that Rapture I have been predestinated to be a part of that Rapture that's my position that's my place God elected me to fulfill that that's why I've been created I've been created to take my position to be that fulfillment of the word of God I am that Royal seed my proportion in that Royal seed has got to be manifested just in the position that God placed me in you say well what happens if you die I'll meet you in the air because I'll rise first that would be in my position that would my my election that would have been the part that God chose me to play you can't look outside of yourself the kingdom of God is within you the Revelation is within you God brings that word to pass that life to pass in Your Heart by the spoken word that he predestinated to that time in that age to Enlighten you and revelate you and increase your understanding it's not a group thing it's an individual thing and those individuals by the nature of the spirit and the word are drawn together to fit and join together and make a body because every piece of that puzzle has been cut to match up with the other piece and that piece of the puzzle Longs for the peace that makes it complete because it wants to finish the picture how many believes God wants to finish the picture how many believe you're part of the picture well quit fussing about the way he cut you out because he's benefited together he's going to position it together and then this is it's different so I want you to understand you're different your oddballs you're all very weird but that's the way he does it he takes things that only he can fix and he'll fix him it's beautiful you understand what I'm getting at about accepting your election if you accept your election you will enter into the program it's like applying for a school and you finally get your scholarship and you don't accept it well when you get that when you get that letter of acceptance and you get that scholarship you just don't run over here and get your degree come here right yes I don't go down and go for a job interview and they say Well Mr McGarry uh what's your qualifications now that you're going to run our whole company you're going to be the CEO well sir I want you to know I was accepted into Harvard and I had a full scholarship never went through the program never attended class you know but hey no accepting the elect the scholarship is accepting the program it's accepting the tutorship it's accepting the experiences it's accepting the trials it's going through the failures it's the educations it's the struggles and when you get all done with going through all that and it comes time to take your degree it comes time to take the job TV you've got to know that you're chosen for it you've got to have that part in your heart that says this is me because the other seed was conceived with slightly doubting you know Pentecost is is the evidence of doubt oh I got way ahead of myself bad boy let's just read for a little bit do you have the Royal Seed of Abraham he says it cannot be the natural Ken carnal seed of the church it'll have to be the Royal seed of the word of God through Abraham the Royal seed that's why the Rapture has to be first because remember we which are alive and remain shall not hinder prevent them which are asleep for the Trump of God shall sound the dead in Christ shall rise first and we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them together to meet the Lord in the air notice it's written again and the rest of the Dead live not for a thousand years therefore they will not be heirs together they're not to be in the Rapture together there's absolutely a church natural a church spiritual a church carnal and a church spiritual the two different churches and they're so close it would deceive the very elective possible and each one's claiming evidences that they're the true church let's get to the first thing that's got to be solved see here there see here is no there is no judgment to the Royal spiritual predestinated seat of Abraham for they are predestinated to eternal life they have accepted God's provided sacrifice and that sacrifice which is Christ the word and therefore therefore now no condemnation Saint John 5 24 if you want the scripture there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus Romans 8 1 that walk not after the flesh but after the spirit Romans 5 24 he that heareth my word the word there is understandeth any drunken anyone can hear it and come walk away but the hearing of my words understands my word and believed on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into the Judgment but has passed from death into life now that is not my works that's by election you will never pass from Death unto life if he didn't elect you to do it because you have no ability in yourself thanks be to God I'm going to try to go real quick now yes sir that is the great mystery of God made known understand how that God was in Christ reconciling himself to the world how that he and the father were one and how that the great mystery of the fulfilling of God taking and bringing himself manifested in the age of human beings and the stream of human beings and in the company of human beings to make his word manifest in the day in the East Eastern rising of the Sun okay that's what he did to him right but now you're talking about your election what you've been elected to see what you've been called to what you've been chosen to be a part of how you've been separated out he just said this is what they understand they see they get the mystery of it the same he says his word manifested in the Eastern rising of the Sun and to do the same thing as the sun sets in the West to make himself manifested in a bride Church the word made manifest now what are we elected to are we elected to anointings are we elected to gifts so to say they're good but we're elected to a word Union where the word was made flesh now the flesh is being made word so there's a perfection and a maturity that this bride has been elected to that sets them apart from anything that's ever before therefore there's a separation of this people from the shock that carried them so their power oh remember the rain falls on the just an unjust they're very shouts but their power is not in the rain their power is in the seed because they have the life they not only do they have the word but they've accepted their election to be the word now they've got what thus saith the Lord they're not relying on something that's outside that's why he got to the place he said pray to him that was within you the kingdom of God is within you that you can't understand either the beginning or the end of it in other words what he's trying to bring us to is the revelation of what we were in his mind in the beginning don't think you're going to get in unlovey-dovey Christianity oh I'm just going to love everybody I'm going to pick up the snake and put them in my pocket say oh good snake I got so much love in my heart you know that and you know the snake bites it's hard when you talk to people how can two walk together unless they agree every time I open the door and I go into something my testimony is this is a good place I go into a restaurant and I eat there I'm either going to come out saying this is pure food this is good food this is home cooking this is the best ribs I'm gonna go back or I'm not going to patronize that place right but if I keep patronizing that place and I keep patronizing that place and so where do you want to go well let's go over to Papa goes where do you want to go well let's go over to Spring Creek where do you want to go let's go over to Lucille where do you want to go let's go over to Dixie House would you think by the time that I think that's a good place look if I don't believe in something why do I keep going there why do I keep patronizing it why do I keep because now I'm I am preaching their gospel I'm saying this is good food this is what everybody should have no it's important because that's part of the reproach is blessed is he who is not offended in me what the problem was the church didn't like the product they didn't like what the words producing they want denomination they want system they want organization they want signs these signs that this church is going to have is not the signs of of of emotion It's The Sign of the saith the Lord when they meet Satan face to face and they stand there and they say it is written it is written get behind me because they're steadfast because it doesn't come from without it comes from within you say are you again shouting no I love to shout I love to praise I would that all of you speak in tongues I would that you all dance in the spirit I have danced in the spirit it's wonderful but it's not what God's bringing us he said the bright Church the word may manifest it will he that understandeth that is to know that been revealed to him of him that sent me has everlasting life and will not come into the Judgment but is passed from death and the light what is it a bride church right the word made manifested it it will too he that understandeth that is to know that's been revealed to him of him that sent me has everlasting life do you know there's a pathway of Revelation that God chose God chose a prophet to bring the revelation to the church it didn't it it didn't choose he didn't choose a another way to do it he chose the the word way to do it and and there's there's just no separation from that let's grab our Bibles real quick as we work here just for a moment this morning to go over to Corinthians and you know this great Corinthians 13. how it just speaks of all these great the great things in the word of God so he's talking about charity 13 4. charity he says you know of all these things you've got to have love how many knows that loves the Capstone God is love right God is the word in the beginning was the word in the beginning was the love the love is what put you here the love is what created you the love is what elected you it's the love that made you the way you are you see me just the way I am here I'm the love of God now you might think he might have done a better job you know he could have left me with some hair he could have rearranged a few facial features he could have made me stronger and have a much more better personality but he wouldn't relying on that I'm not relying on that I'm relying on the love part of accepting my election is accepting the love that goes with it God so loved us here as we're reading it says Charities long suffereth long and is kind charity envious not Cherokee Bank of itself it is not puffed up does not behave itself unseemingly seeketh not our own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in truth beareth all things believeth all things hope with all things endureth all things charity never faileth but what wherever well where there be prophecies they shall fail where there be tongues they shall cease where there be knowledge it shall vanish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come then that which is in part shall be done away when I was a child I spoke as a child I understood as a child I thought of the child but when I became a man I put away childish things because there was a the maturity you've been under the tutors but you're no longer we've got we got to take our our uh diploma and we got to enter into the work Force and perform our elected trade whatever it may be but you're equipped with it he's put it in you each one of you has the power of God wrapped up in your heart if we could move past the doubt we don't compart shall be done away when a child I spoke as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkening but then face to face now I know in part but then shall I know even as I am known where do you think you are where are we in the the great scheme of things where are we in the time that we're living we're no longer heir of the shock the life has come up right we've come down to the age of maturity the shock is there what was the shock it was Pentecost right they spoke in tongues they prophesied they they did all these great things but they did it in part and it's fine the prophet of God said it was a good Chuck it brought us to where we are but it's hard because everything in the word is manifested in the flesh so the shock when it was coming it wasn't a shock it was a type but there was real human beings that were living worshiping and praising that represented that type in the flesh if that type's represented in the flesh then there's got to be a seed type represented in the flesh there's got to be something that comes into maturity of the same seed that went into the ground oh Hallelujah I'm looking at a house full of them little Messiahs Sons and Daughters of God that have their diploma that have thus saith the Lord that have the word of God that meets Satan it is not going to move him with a shout it's not going to move them with a Hallelujah or with dancing not a people that's got to be delivered over and over and over again you know how Deliverance Ministry works first of all I'd convince you all sinners you all got problems you all got trouble with television you all got trouble with internet you all got trouble with your phones you low down Center people you're so burdened and all this stuff you need Deliverance come on up I'll lay my hands on you well you feel delivered you'll fall out I'm not afraid thus saith the Lord you'll fall out and you have another big Deliverance you'll run to the altar over and over and over again you know why that's the shock is the shock it's a good shock it's a good thing speaking in tongues and prophesying and the anointing of the Holy Spirit and Dreaming Dreams and seeking Visions all that was what brought us it brought us to the place if that wasn't there we would have never recognized the ministry of William Branham and it's good you say can we still do that yes do it but understand that's not what God's bringing you to okay and let's close with this and we'll be on this subject some more because paragraph 91. and I'll just throw a paragraph 82 in there before or 81. it's just like the corn matures or the wheat it comes forth a stock then it comes forth the pollen and then comes forth the shuck but when you think that the shock if you don't watch it it'll look just exactly like the real wheat but when it's opened up the real wheat is on the inside it's only a carrier you see Mary through faith not through sex but through faith something exactly like it Mary was not that seed Mary was the carrier of that seed he was a genuine Faith seed because the word of God Is by faith that he gave to Abraham and only faith can produce what God said it'll do faith in his word paragraph 91. but Pentecost represented Mary but Pentecost represented Mary Mary the last stage of it now she was not the seed yet the life of the seed was in her now you see what he's saying right so Pentecost the life of the seed was in it that's why it's attracting it's you can't say it's not the life you can't say it's not the anointing you can't say it's not the spirit and you can't say this is it but they're they're they're there there's something more that pushes beyond that so I don't ever want to be guilty and I know a lot of people put me in that place I'm not against the life that was in the shock because it was the life mm-hmm but what I want you to understand is you're called for something higher than that so don't look for the life that was in the shock look for the life that was in the seed same life couldn't I preach anointed ones at the end time right now same life listen yet Pentecost represented Mary the last stage of it now she was not the seed yet the life of the seed was in her but it hadn't matured yet I feel very religious it hadn't matured yet it was there but it wasn't matured that's my heart's desire is the maturity and I know a lot of people because they've been brought into this message and they haven't been through that shuck stage that they're attracted to it okay it's okay but there's a maturity Beyond it there's a maturity where you make contact with the word you don't need them brushing wind you don't need a shiver you don't need excitement You Know Who You Are you know where you're going you know where you're come from you know what you've been trained with you know what you possess and ain't no devil in hell yes I'm gonna move you because you possess the gates of your enemy I've been chosen I've been elected I've been called my name's on the Lamb's Book of Life I've matured to that perfect faith that Jesus knew what the word said he was and he wasn't afraid to accept his calling for this cause did you know that Jesus had to accept his position as Lord and savior and Messiah just like you have to accept your position and pride Jesus by faith sought the scripture took his life lined it up with the scripture and came to the place saying what they're talking about I am no wonder he said I am the I am that's what he was I am I am that word I am the god that orchestrated history that raised those prophets that put Israel in bondage that ran the whole history of his people to produce the prophecy and a in an example and a shadow and a type he said I am that word I am the way I am the truth I am the life that was the mature seed the I am to be all-inclusive that's the big thing nowadays again can I say we are the we are I'm not the shock I'm the full maturity of the word of God that's predestinated for this day did that offend you let me say it again you know I don't ever say something unless I got a quote don't you I'm trying to make sure that we don't stray though all these things are wonderful and if you want to you want to scream I'm all for it I scream in my office all the time I love to rejoice I love to praise God praise God hallelujah it's wonderful but I want to understand what I've been elected to I've been elected to a maturity that makes me in a position that's been prophesied is that as he is so are we on this Earth and he didn't go by outside feeling he went by inside Revelation that allowed him to speak the word and he lived by Spoken Word and let's just go and finish up this morning and we'll go we'll just jump over it this this ought to all get your hearts on fire to get into seed us not air with the shot let's jump over here to paragraph 100 but when the seed was delivered it said I come to do the will of him that sent me don't let that blow by you when the seed was delivered aren't you the seed that's been delivered in this day he put you in this day he delivered you in this day he put you in this dark time this Dark Hour this Dark Age he delivered you to this age he could have delivered you to another age you say deliver you were in his mind the color of your hair the color of your eyes everything your statue and everything you were with him in the beginning and he delivered you to this age Hallelujah I've been birthed to this time to this age to this maturity if I'd have been birthed in Pentecost I'd have been the most dancing shouting speaking in tongues running around the church fool you ever seen I wasn't delivered to that age it's the same life because it's the same life I can produce the same product did that go over anybody's head because it's the same life this same life produces justification this same life produces sanctification this same life produces a restoration of the gifts but this same life produces maturity of Christ the word in The Believer I come to do the will of him that sent me I and my father are one these are your words they're your words when the seed is delivered you are the seed delivered it it said I come to do the will of him that sent me how many Heroes come to do the will of him that sent you the rest of you can do your own will thank God for the blood of Jesus Christ and the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he can get you he says and I am my father are one how many of you and God are one the rest of you God can make you one you don't have to raise your hand I'm just not trying to be so heavy on you if I do not the if I do not his Works Believe Me Not there was the seed which one of you can condemn me of unbelief what the Bible has promised I would do I done it now hasn't the Bible promised you that you're going to be the elect mature seed word of God little Messiahs and to do the works that he did also you know he did very little works in the synagogue because the Sinners weren't there we're reading down right notice he says but the seed in Mary the shuck it was close to being that but it wasn't it was still in the womb so can you imagine that here's all this movement of the spirit it is the life but the seed is still in the womb of that do you understand it's hard for the womb to let go of the sea now I don't have that experience but I should get amen from every mother in here it's hard there's what did we just read we just read in Galatians there's a travail it doesn't want to move from the life that it had in the shock where that spoke in tongues where it prophesied where it worked Deliverance where it had the movements and the movement of the spirit and everything was flowing and they felt that was God but it was hard for the shock to give Deliverance to the true seed and to come forth and become what it was in the womb to do was to produce the genuine son of God again we had the son of God but what was he missing he was missing his Eve because he was a two-part being in the beginning so he was missing his second part because without you he's not made perfect and without him we're not made perfect but the shock didn't want to give it up they wanted to birth that works now you say the word the bride is the word because her in the bridegroom are one didn't want to birth her out or she could come United totally with him in an invisible Union and become the word but notice he said notice Pentecost age it was still in the womb but notice in the Pentecostal age through the Luther age through the Wesley age it seemed to be the same thing through this Pentecostal age now notice but at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelations 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again the full word is to be born into manifestation again not the shock but the full word is to be born who is that full word who has been predestinated who has been elected who has been chosen I have Hallelujah are you against anything I'm not against anything I'm only for my election I want to be what he wants me to be well he's elected and chosen me to be the full word born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as it was when he was here on Earth manifested the same way doing the same things that it did when it was here on Earth amen Hebrews 13 8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Luke 17 30 said in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom when the son of man will be revealing himself again it'll be the same thing the world's in a Sodom condition and the churches went into Sodom with it like Lot's wife and I say that there is a elect church somewhere in this world that's pulling out and set aside from those things and the manifestation of God has attracted its attention we're at the last days the shut has given forth its strength into the seed it when uh it went on out it was a good shock but it served its time see it is word Bride of the word groom God bless you this morning God bless you accept your election accept your positioning in Christ accept the life that you can live don't defeat yourself if you don't have that life it's yours claim it not by some laying on of hands not by some feeling not by some repentance but by revelation of your election this is mine because I've been elected to have it I'm going to take it and it's going to produce in me The Works that he did also it's the same life but one is maturing let's mature and you know how I feel about this message the only place that maturity lies is in the message of God's word God bless you I hope you understand me my heart and what I believe thank you brother Billy thank you my brother God bless you hey man I saw a stand this
