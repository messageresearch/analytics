half moon looking things there you go hey yeah you don't up here real nice and close you're not fixing to tell you a good story yeah you want to hear a good story all right you see the way this happens the way this works is there's this really really powerful magical book and in this book it's so powerful that it can transport you through time in the blink of an eye and if you don't believe me you want to see what that book is you got to be careful you got to be careful this book's powerful this book is powerful see that book right there that book right yeah is the most powerful book on the face of God's green earth and you know in this book are some of the most incredible but true stories that you'll ever hear and I'm gonna tell you a story about a young man you know sometimes it's hard for young kids to see where it is that they fit in God's plan sometimes when we're little like you all are it's hard for us to look out there and see all those grown-ups out there who are well slightly older but see all them grown-ups out there and you see him he said well I see where my mom fits in I'm a dad what about me right because your little your little guys but I'm gonna tell you about a young man I'll tell you about a young man that God used to bring an entire nation back to his feet I need a volunteer who's eight about eight years old I need somebody 8 years old 8 years old all right come here buddy all right you see this guy right here what's your name Malachi see Malachi Malachi's but did you know that there's a young man in the Bible that God used it was this guy's age he was just this guy's age thanks Malachi have a seat his name was Josiah and Josiah and Josiah the reason that God used him is because the children of Israel now who knows who the children of Israel was they were God's chosen people but you see the problem see I've been to Jerusalem a whole bunch of times back in the past not being in and out of there all the time I teleport in and out I come and go but this one time I went back and the children of Israel had a real bad habit of disobey they always thought that they had a better idea than God did but you know what this one time I teleported back man I popped out just like I did a minute of going sometimes you just never know where you gonna land the takeoffs are great but it's the landing that's a little bit rough sometimes I popped out that time in the middle of one of them streets and right into a Pigpen what I come to and I was not to snout with a 400-pound pig and a smell lord of mercy you ever smelt a smelly smell that smells smelly well this is one of them smells it's that kind of smell that you smell that you're like Oh Lord that ain't never coming out well two days later I got the smell out okay I'll give you the recipe later on it's some duct tape and all kinds of good stuff anyway I walked out into Jerusalem and I started walking the streets and I tell you what I could not recognize Jerusalem to save my life it was a mess all the temples of the Lord were all torn down there was idols everywhere there were people running up and down the streets acting crazy it was not the Jerusalem that I knew and I said what in the world is going on here about the kid must find somebody but you know what it was under the rule of a king called Amon and he was a bad bad man he liked worship idols and crazy things and they were doing all kinds of weird stuff pretty soon the people of the town said you know what we've had enough and they killed him because they were tired of living that way and they were desperate they were so sad and desperate because because they were gently was the world was just a mess but you know what happened a Manhattan he had a little Sun and the people were so desperate they said you know what we ain't putting in another adult in there cuz adults are gonna mess this thing all up I know what do they got Josiah and he was 8 years old and they said Josiah you're gonna be the king that Josiah was like what me I barely knew how to tie my shoes but you know what Josiah knew Josiah even though that he hadn't been raised a Christian Josiah knew that there was a better way Joe solder knew that somewhere in his heart there was a better way to live than what those people were living like and so Josiah sat down in the Kings chair but I do know there's a better way he said and so he got the high priest and he pulled him in he says well mr. high priest you lost I just learned that a diamond shoes and the priest said well Josiah what do you want to do well I guess I guess we better find a better way and Josiah knew that the best way to go well that was God's Way that's what Josiah knew so Josiah said all of his mighty men and he called him in he said fellas look ok I said he said he said fellas look here's what we got to do we have got to find the book you see because your sign knew that there was power in the words of the book he knew there was power in those words so Josiah this book and I know what you're thinking the book was called the book of the law and that book was a book that had been written by Moses it was given to Moses by God and God said and john-john Josiah said I gotta find this book because I know that if I can find this book that I can undo all the mess that my forefathers made in the town so he said everybody out and we went he went down to the business and he went down to the business of cleaning house and he said that said all this idolatry stops and he got out his hammer and he went out there and he started smashing idols and he smashed the idols so bad that they were powder he mashed him he got him all down broke all the idols and tore down all the temples and in the middle of the city in the middle of the city of Jerusalem is a big giant building called the temple of the Lord it's a huge beautiful building and it's built for the worship of God but you see the idol worshippers they went in there and they destroyed it and they tore it down and they filled it full of trash and they made a mess out of it well Josiah said you know what first thing I got to do first thing I got to do is clean up the house I got to clean up the house of the Lord that's what he said so he got all the janitors and he got his painters and his carpenters and he's in all of these guys and he said guys we got to go down and we got to clean up the house of the Lord that's the first step so he went in and they started painting the walls you ever painted before man it gets everywhere doesn't it and you get on your nose and it's in your hair and I've ruined a good pair of shoes doing that they painted and they fixed everything and as they were moving the junk from inside the temple what do you think they found they found the book of the law and they ran to Josiah said Josiah look what we found look look what we found and Josiah said praise be the Lord and he said now here's what I want you to do mr. high priest I want you to read me this book read it to me I need to study it I need to get inside of it and figure out what's going on in my kingdom I got to find out what's going on I need answers and I know they're in that book so the high priest sits down to business and they start reading and they start reading and it says thou shalt not and remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy and the high priest is reading it - Josiah and Josiah realized that the way that they were livin was so bad then he had jumped up on his feet and he ripped his clothes and he threw himself on the floor before the Lord and he said Lord I am so sorry we did wrong we lived wrong we acted wrong we behaved in a bad way but lord I promise you lord I promise you that I'll fix it that's what he said he said I promise you that I said about the business of fixing it but you see the Lord was angry he was mad because the Israelites they had been living so bad it was bad I mean they were spray-painting walls it was bad they were driving cars on the wrong side of the road and the one way and running the stoplights and the whole bit it was bad yeah it was there was there was an anarchy in there was dogs and cats hanging out together and they had goldfish and betta fish in the same tank yeah yeah I mean did you just don't do things like that God was mad he was real mad he said no I'm on a judge Judah I'm gonna judge that country but you know what your sign because you read that word and because you recognized what you guys did wrong I'm gonna spare Israel for your sake Josiah and I'm gonna give you all another chance to fix it and Josiah did for the next years of his reign he sat about the business of fixing all the things and under Josiah's reign people got to know the name of God all over again because they had forgot the name of God could you imagine could you imagine you forget the name of God could you ever forget that name that's a hard name to forget right it's God how do you forget that but they forgot they couldn't remember what it was like to serve God anymore so Josiah said the first thing we got to do is have ourselves a Sabbath and they had a Sabbath and they kept it and that was the first Sabbath that they had kept in like a hundred million years okay wasn't that long but still it's a long time so Josiah fixed it and God used this boy who started as king he started out at eight years old so when y'all think I don't know nothing about God maybe God don't even know me think about your sire because God knows every one of you he knows every little hair on your head or in my case there's no hair he knows a man he knows everything about you he knows how many times that you take a breath when you sleep at night he knows how many times that you blink your eyes he knows how many times did you think good thoughts and you think bad thoughts and he knows them so when you guys think where do I fit in in God's plan just know that he's waiting for you he's got it all set up for you and one of these days maybe he'll use you like a Josiah and he'll have you fix the nation and he'll have you do some great things maybe you'll be the next preachers the song leaders for ladies you'll you'll be the next Sunday School teachers and then you'll be able to teach the people like you holy cow right mind blown I'll tell you what Josiah fixed the nation of Israel he fixed it started out eight-year-old boy fixed the whole country imagine all right guys how many like that story awesome you guys can go back to your seats thank you for being wonderful listeners great job guys so how many want to be like a Josiah yeah how many of you guys want to be a Josiah how many you want to be just somebody just somebody that God just uses just a little bit and maybe maybe God doesn't use you to do a whole big old nation and stopping world thing maybe he just needs you to be kind to one another maybe he just needs you to say couldn't worry mom good morning dad maybe that's all he needed because sometimes moms and dads have a rough day too right sometimes they have a bad day sometimes maybe just a hug fixes a whole lot of stuff really does right well guys I want to thank you for your time thank you for listening and I got to teleport I got to get on to the next place so I don't know who's taking my place but here in just a few seconds I'm out of here you guys have a great
