and Ecclesiastes was the frustration of Solomon's old age Ecclesiastes estación as to Adam and Sarah and when you read the book of Ecclesiastes he kinda lost Ecclesiastes it almost seems to contradict

this morning for that no matter to opinion don't fundamental what a thing it is look at them into yes but you finally understand that I'm feeling in their watch as we get into this message now is the mintus entrance to understand where Solomon is coming from you know in the V&A Salamone we have to take into consideration two expressions that he gives through the book then Emma's came tenderness especially scale a state number one Munna under the Sun debajo del Sol number two under heaven democracy you know and I want you to those are the two expressions I want you to remember today aikidoka requited a solomon uses the expression under the sun Telemundo's a lesbian debacle in seoul 27 times in the book of ecclesiastes st. TCA terraces in a liberal ecclesiastes but he only uses the phrase under heaven three times hey Roberto de Cielo Lucia Christmas watch this is what the unbeliever does not understand or get about this book it's the local government in they or receive it as to leave 27 times saying this is and he says things like this he said questions I've seen all the works that are done under the Sun joint beast almost over asking each other it's all vanity oh it's money that I hated life was the because the work done under the Sun its authoritarian of spirits affliction the spirit and then he goes on to say that the person never born you say let persona canoe kinesio is better off than men living under the Sun it's mejor que los office trying to tell us something now are you with me he's trying to tell once again whenever smashed those that were not born those cannot I'm not saying you're better off it's those that live under the Sun can you escape even they're like oh my once again under the Sun they work on its own under heaven the rock well it's you know life under the Sun let me that the ruffle is so just speaking about cycles I've gotta stick close a life without God who not be lasting Dios are you with me I'm gonna say it again it's not gonna be I was at all vanity for care of because my life lived under the Sun but you know either there's a life lived without a purpose it's an arena sim propósito if my purpose in life see me propose it is to get well for myself is their mantra naughty kids to be educated instead adieu kado hello if that's my purpose in life to make myself somebody try to make myself somebody big this is me propose it to the SME alguien grunting I have missed it a million miles Clara of mean listen it is a life without God it's what I mean I see the earth it is man trying to find happiness outside of God s along with the Thunder that was kinda felicidad 20 long did I remember now you can see the Old Testament is types and shadows 20 poses that are pointing to the New Testament system and the phrase under the Sun he la francaise means that one is living life you know viviendo love is under their rights as a son PB ain't over for most deliciously unique home are you with me I'm gonna say it again under the Sun they huaca del sol been under your rights and privileges as a son of God though they lost a rich and when you are living under those privileges the via the resistors please all vanity although it's money that they have not recognized no one but who knows they are a son of God it's not because did you have that they don't have to live under their god-given rights and privileges he cannot even give me back one dose then it shows CC privileges and when one lives life under those rights and privileges as a son you can don't get be about horses belay heals all is vanity although is money done are you with me church it's not called me Gorman it makes sense then when Paul says enter 16 isn't you know I have seen all the works that are done under the Sun when the Paradiso dijo every stole a sovereign and behold all his vanity when our works and our labor our actions quantumness nosotras intersección a surface are not guided by God's great purpose in those propose a toast no Sun ghettos Polly by God's great purpose propósito they granted then life is empty it doesn't mean Isaiah and a vexation of spirit his vanity efflux you and any of what we do is not for the glory and honor of God he looks like Gloria is the man we've lived our life under the Sun and possess that most people understand me that debajo del Sol I want you to ask yourself the question this morning am i living under the Sun or under heaven estoy viviendo they weren't going to solve our hotels don't scare yourself I guess another person who asked yourself this the question I guess is de la pregunta watch watch as he as it unfolds he assumed interest in peace because if we live under the Sun or kcvo there is no contentment no icon like no place there is no satisfaction - that affects there is no peace no I know joy he goes under the Sun where Christ is not leading the rock was installed on the Nastya because living under the Sun is tiring well Sunday's cansado depressing as the premium pouring rido it's a vicious repetitive cycle esto stickler deputies Oh work trabajo school squalor home life la vie de la casa even the

another way to live there tomorrow de vivir within the same book of the ecclesiastic gonna miss more liberal he began to tell us that there's not a better way another way to live he starts Ecclesiastes 3 impersonalist yes distress with these words when it does belong to everything there is a season yes because the believer would kill again thing goes to the same cycles as the unbeliever who is most sick we're all humans almost too much we all have to go to work oh we gotta go scare the families not for me everyone has the same as going through the same cycle those muscles mismo stickler but what solomon is trying to get our attention about this element that the matter is not he says to everything there is a season separate annoying implant a time to every purpose under heaven the rifle is yellow oh now here he's telling the believer her Achilles they don't live under the Sun live under heaven and you'll find a purpose for why you do what you do but can notice in quintero propósito podcast you can read it when you get home and oj get customs when he says the time to give birth a time to die him put anesthetic April laughs do you plan a time to uproot him kill
