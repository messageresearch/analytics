and work we must pass through a process most episode process in order for certain events to take place or unfold or the para que ciertos eventos the cerulean when we talk of time with allah moses we have heard this many times moses which always to muchas veces time is simply event as Yukos implement this one event and therefore we must remember lo tanto tenemos que recorded events cannot happen
