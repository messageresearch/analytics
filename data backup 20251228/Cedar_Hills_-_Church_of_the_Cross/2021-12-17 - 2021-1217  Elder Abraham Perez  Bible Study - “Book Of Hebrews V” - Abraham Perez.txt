========================================

so so so so god bless you this basically every day that passes by we're closer to eternity [Music] and i'm so grateful for all of you that made an effort to be here may god bless you and help us as we go into it this will be our fifth bible study on the book of hebrews will you please stand so we can ask the lord for directing this evening like in the days of pentecost [Music] so lord we're together believing the same thing [Music] why the prophet skipped the first 14 verses i have no idea no idea so lord i am asking you for your divine help that you help us as we try to explain this first 14 verses so we kindly ask your presence and your anointing god bless everyone that's online internet and all that are present here anoint my lips love you nothing people come out of my mouth [Music] name of the lord jesus christ 25 so if you will open your bibles to hebrews chapter 3 verse 1. wherefore holy brethren partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle and high priest of our profession christ jesus participated my bible says confession and not profession which i think is more correct but his the high priest you confess to the priest equal correct is much called saying that then we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold first our confession that doesn't mean just to keep testifying don't profess a christian no professor christiano and leave something else because you'll be the biggest stumbling block in this world christiano hold first to your confession [Music] and we're just fulfilling what the pastor said this church is a scriptural church that way you don't take our word if we can prove by the scriptures then you're anchored who was faithful to him that appointed him as also moses was faithful in all his house was moses faithful numbers 12 verse 5 numerous cuatro versus numbers 12 numbers and verse 5. and the lord came down in the pillar of the cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called aaron and miriam and they both came forth and he said hear now my word if there be a prophet among you i the lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and will speak unto him in a dream my servant moses is not so who is faithful in all mine now no see with him will i speak month to month even apparently and not in dark speeches and the similitude of the lord shall he behold for for then were you not afraid of to speak against my servant moses to this now who has more glory all right gloria the house or the builder la casa constructor second corinthians 3 7. it's going to get good now and we're now in chapter 3 in chapter 3. brother venom says you better know how to swim because we're going to go through deep water this is but if the ministration of death written and engraving in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not step fastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away [Music] does death have a ministry of course here it says the ministration of death in my greek bible says the ministry of death ministerio who is administration but administration is just a minister doing this in the beginning the spirit of god and a principio el espirito de dios moved upon the face of the waters god the spirit is without form informa but as the builder of the house it can come in any form and moses wanted to see him and only saw his back because god changed from the supernatural to the natural jose [Music] and became one of us he came as the so he came as a solomon when did he change porn [Music] [Music] is he right isaiah oh my he changed forms it comes in different forms remember but the greeks wanted to see him and they didn't see him because he was in the temple of his humanity again i asked the question does death have a ministry was jesus an apostle jesus yes amen amen scripture and message of unleavened bread drew knife which is called the passover estava and the chief priest inscribed thought how they might kill him for they feared the people here he goes then enter satan into judas her name is scaried being of the number of the 12. is scary as i said last night and jesus christ was born the son of god jesus christ then god lived in christ is that right and satan lived in judas if christ was the son of god born the son of god christ the incarnate son of god elijah's incarnation then satan was born the son of perdition he was incarnate in judas in uh an apostle is one sent is someone that goes and puts orders in order but saying in so where did that spirit come from the thunderstorm to quest when you're reading the in the church changes from the left these denominations are the synagogue of satan and they do you think that they could be pray for the sick and s and for money and they would give them money so you see where the spirit comes from best done so if death hit a ministry what about life we read what we read at the beginning if you follow me closely we're gonna end with the same thing who has more glory gloria the builder of the house or the house oh la casa first corinthians 3 16 the medical influence that she says knowing not that you are the temple of god and that the spirit of god dwelleth in you jesus if any man defile the temple of god him shall god destroy for the temple of god is holy which temple is and then those attributes became words and they had to become flesh what did he bring back he had to bring something that he that uh he did he to bring back the the people that will never be able to see it does everybody in the world tell us were they in the thoughts was everybody in the thought of god but they're all on the thoughts of god today am i not all the people were in the thoughts of god in the beginning was the woman at the well in the thoughts of god in the beginning who was the woman of the world it was you you you you and myself notice at the time that she went because because she went to get water from that well you come to this church to get water from the well healed us and notice that jesus came to her he could say jesus why did jesus come to her when the bible says unto his own he came jesus let me ask the question so she was drinking from that well that belonged to the jacob dog years before then that spirit is a spiritual ask you the same question go call your husband esposo well [Music] so then you and i entrances us attributes of him at the beginning activities were made flesh and we became redeemable limousines partners in pharmaceuticals this is why this message was revealed to each and every one of you but our fathers worshipped on this mountain and in jerusalem in silver city in las cruces ferrantes are almost in silver city in las cruces woman let me tell you not even in silver which is the glory in the house or or the builder of the house he does not dwell in buildings made by the house by a handsome man [Music] in the old testament in antigua testamento god veil himself behind badger skins they was at his mercy seat estaba and social media and to them he would come as a cloud or a pillar of fire and would bail himself to the outside world that's what jesus told the woman of the world in the world i don't say you don't talk to them you might win some of them but not hang out you know do what they do escondido for this man was counted worthy of more glory than moses inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house for he has been counted worthy of more glory than moses which person is that okay so then to stay away from his glory that happened of course when the veil was read at calvary so now to stay out of his presence the mercy seat from the people ii corinthians 3 but if the ministry of death written engraved in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not steadfastly behold the face of moses or the glory of his countenance countenance which glory was to be done away the ministry or the ministry of death administration in letters and letters of course we know there was the ten commandments which was engraved in stone effect and that law came with glory yes i laid dino congloria but follow me closely second god came down on mount in the same spirit of fire and in miss my spirit to the fuego and the one he gave the promise to el diola promesa he brought him forth with the word what was the word it was engraved in stone yeah because the world always first comes to the prophet now we're talking about the house and the one who built the house who has more glory in tenemas gloria and the ministry of death that's what we read in second corinthians 7. for the world wasn't completely made manifest they knew something had happened to moses but they didn't know what it was the roaring and the thundering that's what they heard and they said let moses speak to us remember that the law came with glory recording can allay be not from gloria to who has more glory and justice continues gloria so then moses with a natural law enthusiasm how much more will the spiritual before it's made manifest to them which has an end or had an end to it was now that uh we have this plague of the covet hit him real hard it started to hit real hard in europe and uh they were superstitious in that time and uh they used to say and this was this year that the cat was an animal of the devil and then people start dying by the hundreds [Music] his house nobody got sick they didn't know why he knows because of many of them all the families somebody died in their house and families what happened moses which says moses had to enter the pillar of fire alone what does that speak up that you don't come here by joining any group he never revealed this to any group you have to walk alone solo nobody makes a decision for you did anybody force you to come tonight over here are you forced to come to church on sunday morning i know some of you like to sleep late you don't have to raise your hands so i would say i know a person that like to sleep kind of late but it's it's hard sometimes to get out especially in the winter when it's warm under the blind case especially anyway but you come to this message nobody forced me to come into this mess if you are redeemable you know who to follow is no coming on you but you followed what he thought thank god for that when moses went up to mount sinai did anybody go with him he went by himself if anybody wanted to follow and you'll get a spiritual [Music] are you the living word there's my sister here you guys preach that that uh that you can give life to the people can you give life to someone mr yolanda you can give life to somebody rachel can you give life to somebody will you have life you can't aren't you are tree of life if the world lives in europe [Music] and those were made manifest in this day and they have to believe the world and the promise of this day that god is pouring out his spirit upon all flesh in the time of moses in a temporary mistake it was manifested with it was manifested only to the exodus people are you danielle in an exodus foreign where are we going well this person all right esta persona and every one of you we are going to two exodus to the grave but what about the inner man just people see we have changed [Music] how shall not the administration of the spirit be rather glorious gloria administerio del spiritu or is the administration of condemnation be glory much more than the administration of righteousness exceeding glory for glory for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excellence for that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished who have more glory quintinimas gloria the house or the builder of the house another thing in the old testament what did the villager skins in the glory of god was hid behind that screen where is the glory of god now where is the glory of god [Music] was in that tabernacle in the wilderness [Music] orita and i'll explain now in that tabernacle in the desert that glory of god hid behind the common people so then when they got to the promised land they did away with that then it is behind skin i say this all right i was talking we had a meme the best friend tommy and jimmy we spent five hours monday with brother from norway and uh very fruitful yes a lot of questions and we like i told uh and i know caleb and you say and i don't know who else they spend a lot of hours so he's taking a lot of immunity he took a lot of ammunition to norway talking to him i i told brother more [Music] it is lamp dreaming time all right so how can the glory of god be behind a dirty vessel in mexico in english a glass uh like a little glass little chimney too and and the films of the fire would blacken the sides of it [Music] so people you know you go to you i know you have to go to the to walmart [Music] can you imagine all the spirits in those places and a lot of times emojis messages you get there from those stores and other time you bring one of those period some maybe maybe not in any of you this this bible studies goes to a lot of people and then you get into a fight with a wife or the wife with the husband you get angry he says where did you pick up that spirit mana as i turn up we're gonna finish with this thomas conesto but now that kind of glory moved to another tabernacle that uh we will not have another bible study until january of 2022. next friday is christmas eve and the following friday is new year's eve and i believe the president wants to have communion correct so get ready okay [Music] that's the reason we we're not going to have bible study studio but glory she kind of glory gloria moved to another house so paul has been speaking about the house who has more glory gloria just as soon as moses brought them out of egypt they were under the blood and they were led right to the red sea when you get the holy ghost there are a lot of obstacles i'm just obstaculous because many are the afflictions of the righteous affliction because jesus jesus as soon as he was baptized he went into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when moses and israel cross the red sea he led them straight to temptation to the wilderness of sin we sing cantamos through many dangers toils and snails i have already come young but amazing grace will see us when they got to the wilderness of sin they started murmuring can you imagine the garlic the onion and the cucumber when they were eating angel's food on the journey comedy [Music] and we see that moses was so upset with them and moses struck the rock twice does you wanted for the house to have more glory than the builder and instead of glorifying me you glorified yourself cause you were disobedient [Music] not glorifying or no glory be god so who has more glory glory of course you know who built the house so god bless you and you pray for me oren for me because uh since the first 14 verses because he comes on the scene and shows me a lot of things may god richly bless you and uh we'll continue next year don't forget sunday's service visa domingo we're going to have company jerry company we're going to have some people from phoenix with us and thank you for being good listeners and may god bless each and every one of us with his word brother jimmy will you dismiss us lord jesus we just thank you tonight for your mercy lord in your grace is to see lord how to that letter that was written in strong lord was under the ministry of death and his your word says the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life lord may you quicken that word in the heart of all your children that are here lord that are receiving that word in their heart and your spirit is writing that word in their hearts lord bless us now as we go through our homes protect us may your angels encamp around about us for we ask it all in the precious name of our lord and our savior jesus christ amen until we meet again god bless you you
