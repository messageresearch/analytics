talking about wake up how many you guys stayed up late last night yeah how many of you had a good reason to stay up late last night yeah what were you doing watching TV what or praising the Lord I like that answer don't know if it's true but I like that answer uh first of all I just like to uh bring greetings uh in the name of my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ man I'm so thrilled to be here grateful for this opportunity once again to stand on this platform which you guys probably don't remember the last time I was up here but just understand it's a a a very very humbling moment a very very humbling situation to be in um those you who get up here and song Lead and play these instruments man I pray to God you guys never take it for granted never take it so uh to get started um ask a quick question how many of you guys in here love the Lord easy answer right all right next question is how many of you guys love love the Lord okay same answer right so how many of you guys trust the Lord with all of your heart right we're going to see because I'm going to test you I'm going to test you based on some of the things that I know probably at least half of you are going through or have gone through in your lives I don't know most of you I know your faces whenever I come back I see you you smile you say hello brother I love you love you guys too but I don't truly know you so today hopefully you have an opportunity to get to know yourselves a little better and hopefully after this service I'll get to know most of you a little better so if you guys would real quick if you have your Bibles uh turn to uh Psalms 13 1-5 this is going to be NLT version so if you have the King James version you you probably won't necessarily be able to follow this wording IED use this version uh because I think it just really really simplifies it it really breaks it down where it doesn't matter if you're 8 years old or if you're 18 you can probably understand it you guys have it please say Amen am all right so Psalms 13 1-5 starting with verse one it says oh Lord how long will you forget forever how long will you look the other way verse two how long must I struggle with anguish in my soul with sorrow in my heart every day how long will my enemy have the upper hand verse three turn and answer me oh Lord my God restore the sparkle in my eyes or I will die verse four don't let my enemies gloat saying we have defeated him exactly don't let them Rejoice at my downfall in verse five which is slowly becoming probably one of my most favorite verses and it's so simple but gosh it just hits me every time I read it verse 5 says but I trust in your unfailing love I will rejoice because you have rescued me hallelujah how many of you guys have felt that just felt rescued by the Lord amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word please be seated so this the message I'm bringing forward today um first of all I'm going go back to verse five because again verse five you're talking a man that was we're talking about David and and when David was in in prison in gath and I'm not going to really go into that I can't get into the book of David and all that stuff we'll be here all day and I don't have that kind of time um but verse five with everything that he was going through that's the one thing that he had on his heart at one point that was in his heart which is I trust in your unfailing love I will rejoice because you have rescued okay so I'm I'm going to define the word trust now I looked this up and and I I didn't have him put it in the slide but I looked up a definition for it I just Google give me give me a definition of trust and one of the things that came up was to firm belief in the reality truth ability or strength of someone or something then it says relations have to be built on trust now it also says similar words are confidence belief and Faith okay now when I look up faith and I'm like okay what's the difference between faith and trust and I can't I'm not really even going to get into that because brother Duron killed it last night he absolutely killed it and he just crushed my message to be honest so you know I had to kind of deviate some things um but when I look that up like faith and trust and what's the difference it says faith and trust have similar meanings and often people will use words interchangeably even Mariam Webster defines Faith as belief and Trust in and loyalty to God uh now for most people there is no practical difference between faith and trust but today we're going to hit on trust and the question I ask which is my title is who do you trust not who do you trust who do you trust no who do you trust not who do I trust because for me it's who do I trust but it's for you who do you trust all right so understanding the the interchangeable parts of faith and trust um understand young people that without faith we have nothing um we are nothing uh we're talking about relationships we're talking about trust we're talking about faith um I read a quote once that said if we expect nothing from the Lord we get nothing from the Lord so to expect something from the Lord and to want something or expect to get something from the Lord you got to have faith right you got to have trust and we're going to keep coming back to that word trust I'm not going to hit so much on faith but you guys know again they're interchangeable so uh about three years ago I was asked to come and and give my testimony here most of you probably don't remember that all right but when I gave my my testimony it was a very like I said a very humbling experience to just be standing here be able to share my life with you guys and share my testimony and what I went through growing up not just as a child but as an old man I know I look 25 but I'm not I'm I'm old enough to be the grandparent of most of you in here believe it or not I just I wear it well sorry so and one of the things too I I have to try to remember I'm going to put this out there because I just think it's important um brother Caleb when he asked me to a little bit of a backstory when he asked me to come and do this today of course I said sure whatever you need me to do brother Caleb he said well you know just give the people or give the youth something positive give them something to um to look forward to to be positive about I'm like okay so so just be a coach and I don't think brother Caleb truly understands that I'm a coach that's my nickname is coach all right so I've coached nearly 18 years of track and field I've coached basketball I've Co coach Pop Warner football um you guys lucky I forgot my whistle cuz I was really going to bring it and I forgot it but I will tell you the first person that refers to me is bro while I'm standing up here AB um we'll be doing push-ups I'm just saying so that a little bit of coach is in me but the other part of being a coach is we talk a lot we love to talk you know what I mean because that's how we get our points across and a lot of times when we're coaching and we're talking we're demonstrating so everything's pretty animated right and we're constantly repeating repeating repeating because it's the process so how many of you have played organized Sports how many of you have had a coach that said trust the process you may not understand the workout we're doing right now I know it hurts you know you're in pain you want to quit but trust the process because right now you're dealing with all of this but on the backside you're going to see the results okay our relationship with the Lord is no different we have to trust the process all right we go to him because there's things that we need there's things that are troubling us things that we don't understand our body's going through changes our parents are mean uh the my teacher doesn't like me and the Lord says be patient trust the process like brother Tommy Jr said a long time ago sometimes we just have to watch the picture develop right okay so going back a little bit of my childhood um uh grew up in a a very very humble environment not a lot of money um hardly any money uh but I had a very hardworking mother that that worked for everything that we needed we didn't have most of what we wanted it just wasn't that way that wasn't our life but we had almost everything we needed you know we didn't eat steak shrimp maybe once a year we got to go to Red Lobster and get the little popcorn shrimp and a little piece of steak that we got split drink of Shirley Temple right all right like once a year but we never missed a meal might have been a baln sandwich but we never missed a meal right wrong balone brother exactly especially when you're fried just right and get that little burn on it right and if and if you're really feeling froggy you like poke a hole in it see if you can get the bubble to go down you guys don't know anything about that actually joson does and Maya does okay Jon just did it the other day she was so excited Dad look amazing right yeah so but there was no social media there was nothing to really draw our attention away from the world around us like right now man you guys and I feel I feel bad for you I really do um in one aspect and that's the fact that you're surrounded by social media everything's social media everything is right here and everything here is not good that's right probably 98% of what's in here is bad right all right we know it's the enemy right okay so we we didn't have that we played outside man we we would we would get bikes bicycle parts from my house and my buddy's house over here and but and we put a bike together we all shared the bike yeah you know or we go out in the woods behind our apartment complex and we we get some scrap wood and we get some cardboard and next thing you know we've got a fort and we're hanging out in there all day till we hear Michael right Ramone get in the house you know we're here we all come running Andre let's go you know we all go running in the house right so that's the kind of life we live you know we have these you know people would in the neighborhood would throw out their mattress so we get the mattresses and we put them at the end of our building and we're tumbling Bo we're doing gymnastics we're flipping mind you some of the people in our neighborhood obviously had some bladder problems if you get my drift so all those mattresses weren't to cleanest mattresses but that's all we had to play with right that's how we kept from breaking our necks when we tried to do a double Su assault and miss you know that's how we kept from killing ourselves was to use those nasty mattresses but that was our life man and we were happy we were happy and the the way we got through it was we had trust okay not necessarily for me back then was it trust in the Lord because I didn't truly understand that but I had trust in my mother that she was going to take care of us her trust was in the Lord because that's all she had she had nothing else all right so as we grow up uh um we you know we developed these friends and and you know we got our siblings but we got these friends in the neighborhood and our neighborhood was a very tight-knit neighborhood whether I was in Florida or whether I went to AR when we finally moved to Arkansas even when I went to Germany as a as a a a junior in high school we we developed these tight-knit neighborhoods we weren't gangs we were just friends and with those friends like even with your siblings I'm sure you too get in the fights every now and then I know Judah and Hannah did because I've heard the stories but these two brothers I know they get into fights I get into fights with my siblings but we loved each other and we trusted each other we always had each other's back if one fought and this is probably not a good thing but this is the way we were raised my mom would say if one of you fight you better all fight or everybody's getting a whipping when you come home that's just the way it was we had trust all right and I could go out and this is not I'm not making this up this is the truth I could go out out and be playing with one of my best friends 10:00 in the morning we get into a fight because we had a disagreement by 2:00 we were playing together again right we had each other's back we were friends now don't come from that neighborhood over here trying to start some mess because we had each other's back I might have just fought with him when it comes time to defend our neighborhood we're all fighting right yeah and I'm not condone in that I'm just saying that's how it was back then back then you could actually fight and walk away nowadays just walk away all right it's not worth it so when I when I turned 17 I I I graduated high school uh 10 days later I went to Army boot camp and then from there I didn't even stop at home from army boot camp went straight to to college when I got there there was so much turmoil in here and so much in here because when I left I had this strange relationship strained relationship with my mother I was trying to grow up you know at 17 years old I was the man of the house probably really from probably age 13 when I got my first job like paycheck job not not you know sweeping my room and clean and putting away my clothes because that was part of my chores no I went to work I went across the street to the quick stop I stocked the the the coolers I swept the the the uh parking lot I cleaned the bathrooms why because I had to help all right although I trusted my mom there was things I wanted that Mom couldn't provide like Nike shoes and lei jeans and you know I didn't want to go to school going close to Kmart I just didn't I was too cool for that so but when I got to college man I was going through so much I was I was excited I just went through army boot camp that really made me a man it brought me out of my my shell because I was a complete introvert uh truly up until that point and the Army really helped me become a man I think but when I got there man with that strain relationship um it brought a lot of sadness in my life there was darkness and I understood that part of it but there was other things that went with that that I I at the time I just couldn't grasp I'm I'm I'm starting a new adventure you know in my life but yet I can't find that Joy anymore that I had when I was a kid and I had nothing I couldn't find that Joy but through the whole process of growing up I lost two sister by the time I was 16 15 two sisters passed away that was part of my testimony I know you guys probably don't remember but I had two sisters passed away so I was dealing with that leaving my mother I was dealing with that um not seeing my younger brother I was dealing with that not having my father in my life dealing with that so I was sad I was broken uh there was just Gloom all the time you know 17 goodlooking kid I'm in college I didn't play sports then but you know I'm seeing the young ladies and hey hey you would think that would have been my focus hey chase the girls enjoy college party I didn't get any of that none of that experience did I have because I was broken now when I finally realized that something was truly wrong I had a friend of mine uh who was kind of like a Aunt to me I went back to my town to visit I went back to a football game as an alumni you know you get invited back to come watch the games and stuff and I would go and I would stay at her house and finally she told me one day she's like you know what you need to go see your mother I can't have you come stay here anymore unless you go see your mother so with the way I was already feeling I thought man what do I have to lose I trusted this lady because she practically raised me and a lot of kids in our neighborhood because we always hung out of of the house and if she said that I should do that I thought man I got to trust her all right so I go visit my mom we have a conversation one of the things she told me was that you know what this is your home this is still your home you can always come back I think that was I went to the game Friday night Saturday morning I went to see my mom by Monday guess where I was I was back home I quit school I had to get back in my element but before I did that it wasn't just her voice that I heard when I got back to Pine Bluff Arkansas where I was going to College University of Arkansas Pine Bluff something told me and I didn't understand it then but I know now something told me I got you trust me this is not your environment this environment is broken you're in bondage I I didn't understand any of this stuff but now when I break it down I understand that's what he was saying to me that was the Lord talking to me amen he said go home this is not where you belong so I trusted that voice that I didn't know really I didn't understand because I went to church here and there you know at the time I was reading my Bible at the time I was going to a church that I would never go back to again because I saw so many bad things there but but something told me to go home so I went home it only took me two days I listened and I was gone now as I got older that same trust that I that I had in that voice that I didn't understand that trust kind of dwindled away why because I was doing better right I wasn't in that that funk that I was in I was doing better I didn't really need that voice that much anymore you know what I mean happy now man I I went and I joined the Air Force I think I had turned 18 by the time I left for boot camp for Air Force got a little money now I'm playing sports right you know I'm back on top again I'm traveling the world uh I'm competing my first trip to New Mexico was while I was competing for the air force uh in fast fo softball which is similar to baseball some of you young ladies probably know what it is but that's that's I was on top of the world I didn't need that voice that trust that I had was gone now all right so when you take and and I'm going to ask some questions and and I'll if you want to raise your hand by all means you can but you don't have to because I'm I'm kind of referring to me but I know I'm talking to probably quite a few of you when you refer back to verse one I don't know if it's up there if if you guys could put it up verse one from uh Psalms 13 1-5 if you guys have it all right when you refer back to that verse it says oh Lord how long will you forget forever how long will you look the other way and again you don't have to raise your hands but how many people in here have felt that yes sir yes sir like man the Lord has forgotten how many people have felt like Nathaniel under that tree like this is going so wrong in my life Lord this is when I need you the most but it's like you don't hear me you're not listening you don't see what's going on around me I felt that okay if you go to verse two how long must I struggle with anguish in my soul with sorrow in my heart every day how long will my enemy have the upper hand all right when I was in college I didn't understand what Depression was I had no idea what Depression was I was depressed I hate that word yeah I hate the word anxiety all right but I know they exist right now you go to a doctor and they're going to diagnose you you have anxiety take this pill okay now you're depressed because you took that pill right so now you have anxiety you have depression uh you have what else uh you're lazy now why because everything just bogged you down and you don't want to do anything you don't want to get up you don't want to go hang out with your friends you don't want to go to work anymore your little part-time job you just quit that because you just don't feel like it right so I I felt that scripture three I'm sorry verse three turn and answer me oh Lord my God restore the sparkle to my eyes or I will die now you're at a point to where you you you're kind of pleading with the Lord like okay I don't know what to do now what do I do you know you might have had uh let's see your first car that you you know you had for a couple of weeks or a couple of months boom you wreck that car your whole world just crumbles around you what am I going to do now or your first love your first girlfriend your first boyfriend I've gone through that man I saw a girl one day and talk about love at first sight I was like who is she wow and I have my cousin say bro you can't get her H you can't get her cuz I'm like I'm going to try though right I got her took me a few months but I got her right and we we dated for two three years I think it was she went on to college I was still in the Air Force two or three years great relationship for the most part but that environment she was in come on completely changed our relationship I thought that was a woman I was going to marry and live forever with but that environment that she was in our relationship all right so I was sad once again I was depressed I'm driving down the highway crying like I don't understand this Lord why Lord I don't I love her I don't okay but I know I'm not the only one that have gone through that right come on now but I when you I don't mean to seem and sound insensitive either but when I think about things like that that's what I call the to me I call that the pity party and we all have a pity party every now and then and it's almost expected when you don't truly know what you have I know some of you guys still don't realize what you have here you're in this ministry fivefold Ministry I never knew what that was I've never even heard of that if someone had told me that at 17 16 years old I would have think man the pastor does laundry what is he folding honestly I I I had no clue what that was are you serious but now but now now I know what it is I know what it means and you guys are privileged you're blessed to be in a situation where you have this ministry and if you're part of that Ministry back there where brother donon I've been there I've been to that church I get excited when I go to that church I get excited when I watch them on television when I hear them worshiping and praising I get excited you know there's times I I'll finish our service and I I know I've told this St before I think at his church I'll finish our service especially with the time change now I can go and I can watch the end of their service and there's times I'll go I'll be at work and I'll just go put my workout clothes on and I'll go walk and listen to it but there's times I'll sit in my room at work and I'll I'll watch it and I'm just watching the service and I'm it's just like watching Cedar Hills I'm up and down you know what I mean I'm praising and worshiping him in my room and I know some of the guys that work are probably wonder what is he doing in me but they know me now when I first started I'm sure they were wondering if I was losing my mind because I would go to other parts of the fire station I would go in the training room and I I get on the big screen man and I put servant up there I praise your worship by myself I'm singing All Out Loud all of the but I don't care you know what I mean that's what I do so when you when you get to verse four verse four says don't let my enemies gloat saying we have defeated him don't let them Rejoice at my downfall time they've attended church with us any kind of service I think my daughter did like one Bible study online with us and then that was it but she's been slowly finding herself in the Lord she's struggling with some things she's retired out of the Air Force at 29 years old so that right there should tell you she you may not understand that but normally you do 20 years and you retire or you have an opportunity to retire she's 29 so she did 7 eight years she's retired so that tells you she struggled with some things my parents struggle with a lot of things but you know their health their finances um their spirituality there's a lot of different things that they struggle with but they came now to get them here it was it was a fight it was a battle because I put the invitation out there I thought what do I have to lose all they can say is no right and now they've been around the Phoenix group and they understand now they're starting to see what the Phoenix group group is all about what that family is all about and when I invited them they were like oh yeah yeah we could probably go my daughter first time I I mentioned it to her she was yeah Dad I think I'd like to go all right little different answer from my parents right so my daughter just started a new job she went to her supervisor she's a chef a pastry chef he works at one of the finest restaurants in Scottdale Scottdale um and and she she talks to supervisor she said hey I i' like to go out of town for the weekend she works Monday through Friday normally just started this stop though she's only been there two three weeks uh we have a trip to New Mexico for church for for Passover uh well if you can find someone to swap your Friday yeah you could get Friday off okay mind you Monday through Friday my parents well I don't know you know our finances are tight and they are I'm so I'm not I'm not mocking them for that the finances are tight so I talk to my wife and I'm thinking you know I don't want them to miss this opportunity money can't be the issue you know let's let's let's try to work it out so I told my parents don't worry about it we'll we'll figure it out if you want to go I'll book the room we'll figure it out right so we're we're ready to go we're we're we're we're getting things together I talk to another brother tell him what's going on and I'm not I'm not going to say any names to them I'm going to put him out there like that he probably doesn't want want to know but I talk to him and he says what money shouldn't be an issue let them know they have a sponsor they want to go they have a sponsor so so I'm thinking all right we've got this thing locked in man I'm celebrating I'm excited my parents are coming my daughter's coming not only are they coming here but they're coming here to worship coming for Passover weekend you know I know what these services are going to be like and I'm thinking what better way for the Lord to speak to them than in the messages this weekend starting with last night right Wednesday I get a phone call from my daughter says Dad I have bad news I'm on duty I'm like what's what's what's going on my super Rogers is I I looked at the schedule and he has me on the schedule for Sunday I'm like what but you don't work Sundays I know that but he has me on the schedule for Sunday so I go to him and and I said why why do you have schedule for Sunday well you know it's the holiday and you know uh it was on the board two weeks ago she's like but I told you I won't be here I'll be out of town he said why are you going out of town he said Prest weekend Passover weekend the family trip we're going to church in in Los cruus New Mexico why you going to church next so when she told me that first thing I thought was that's nothing but the enemy man the enemy is looking for a way to stop this trip to stop her from being able to go on this trip so I she's getting I like hey don't get upset it's not worth getting upset let's just pray on it I have trust that if we pray on this Lord's going to work it out so I immediately get off the phone I said go back to work don't worry about it I get on the phone I send out our group text to the Phoenix group told them what's going on asked asking for prayer brother Tim Garcia senior texts me directly and says brother speak the word I know that but I got caught up for a second and I didn't think of that he said speak the word boom I went back into prayer I spoke the word I think I text my daughter I can't remember I know it was in my mind too I don't know if I got distracted but I remember wanting to text her and I could check my phone and see but I think I text her it's done don't worry about it it's going to work out two hours later I get a phone call guess what Dad it's worked out I'm making a trip I was like I know talk to you later I love you click and I was gone but hey that's trust that's that Faith that's that trust that we were talking about right all right so you oh they took it down already all right so Luke 10:19 the Lord says I have given unto you and you guys don't have to you don't have to pull it up I have given unto you power to tread on serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you so what I want you guys to do because when I'm reading this he's talking to me he says you you is Michael I'm Michael senior that's who I am or you can call me coach that's who I am so I want you guys to put your name in there so it should should read I have given unto you Maya I have given unto you Bo I've given unto you Noah the power to tread on serpents and scorpions wow and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you put your name there that's you the Lord is talking to you he's not just talking to me he's not just talking to brother donon he's not just talking to brother Caleb talking to you you guys have that power we have that power you guys have to understand that we we can't allow the enemy to have control of us and control of our situations and life he doesn't have that power that's for us right do you think that the Lord would give us that type of authority if he didn't trust us he knew us before the foundation of the world you didn't think the Lord knew what kind of battles that we would face absolutely brother he knows he knows what you're going to go through right he knows what you're going through that's right we may not know what you're going through but he knows amen all right trust trust the process trust that he hears you trust that he sees you trust that he he sees you when you're crying at night and you're in your bedroom by yourself sees that all right don't lose that trust don't lose that Faith all right when I got baptized here four years ago brother Tommy Jr you guys are all gone man this is never imagined it would happen that way everyone had gone home we left the sanctuary went to Brother Caleb's house had a couple conversations a couple hours later we were back here just us brother Caleb brother Tommy my mother-in-law uh my wife my my my daughter uh brother Omar a few people that just came back over to the church got baptized right up here well used to be right there and he read acts 238 repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissions of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and having received that gift I can tell you right now I'm I'm no longer the person I I used to be you know it took me a long time to get there it took me 50 52 years 56 now almost 57 it took me 52 years you guys are 12 13 14 years old take advantage of this take advantage of this opportunity now granted it I I keep getting told it wasn't your time it wasn't your time but I know there was opportunities for me to convert my life and become the person that that the Lord wanted me to be I believe there was because even though I didn't quite understand what was going on I had people interceding for me I think I had people I don't know if they were prophesying on my life because I didn't understand that but I had people that would pull me aside and go what are you waiting for I see you envisioning yourself standing up here this is after church service I'm sitting in the front PE just you know engaged like that's that's just me that's the kind of person I was then I get pulled aside afterwards that scared the Daylights out of me I didn't understand that so I don't know if that was the Lord you know interceding for me at that moment and I just didn't grasp it one of my best friends later on went to the Seminary became a pastor I love listening to him I love talking to him and learning from him but when he moved away for me all that went away this was when I'm an adult with a wife and children all of that went away from me so was that the Lord interceding for me right then I don't know because it didn't bring me in it took this family come on it took Cedar Hills come on it took brother donon to bring me in it took brother Judah it took my niece Maya to bring me in talk about it sir go ahead you know that's what it took for me to get where I'm at and I'm I'm getting ready to to wrap this up but brother Brenham what said and this is just a oneliner and I I I love it and it kind of sticks with me he said for some we as Christians may be the only Bible that some people ever read so if that's not Food For Thought for you I don't know what it is so I try to carry that with me I mean my walk prior to coming into the word and coming into the message my walk was almost always a respectable walk I did some things behind the scene that a lot of people don't know about things that I'm not proud of but for the most part I try to always be a leader I try to always be a teacher teacher um I try to always be that positive example for others you know if I had experiences that I could share that would help someone I tried to do that yeah all right so understand when you walk out of here today and you go to Walmart or you go to to Sonic or you go wherever that walk is what people see right all right I can be in Walmart looking for syrup I can see a gentleman or a lady down the aisle and sometimes and and I'm I'm I'm guessing or I'm I'm judging maybe but I can look and see and go man must be a Christian or I can have a conversation with when because I some of you know I'll talk to anybody I don't care I love talking to people I'm a coach I love talking right I'll talk to anyone but you start you engage in that conversation you immediately know if someone's a Christian all right so we're all walking Billboards nice we're we're all walking Billboards not necessarily by what we wear but could be by what we wear yeah yeah yes if you're not wearing the right thing people are going to look at you and go she ain't no Christian not wearing that I see your belly button what is she 12 why do I see her belly button her defense that baby doesn't know any better right that's on the parents right that's on the parents Brother Don has a story about his daughter playing uh running track which just I love that yeah cuz that's me I'm a track coach right but running track in a skirt being the only one out there running in a skirt you think people don't know she's a Christian come on my daughter playing soccer in a skirt I guarantee you if you looked at her you may not think she's a Christian come on J right but she's got that skirt on and I guarantee you that's that's got people thinking like why is that young lady wearing a skirt I bet she's a Christian okay we're walking Billboards remember that when you walk out of here you're representing the person sitting next to you you're representing the person behind you you're representing your parents you're representing brother Caleb you're representing Jesus Christ amen there it is all right there it is he has that trust in you to put you in that position that you're in so you can represent him that's his trust in you right all right I got some other stuff here but I know I'm running out of time so I'm not really going to hit on it um I sound like brother Caleb right now right I'm just going to skip through that um but if you go to Revelations 3:15 probably the favorite scripture of mine this would probably always be my favorite scripture Revelations 15 I'm sorry 3:15 and 16 verse 15 I Know Thy words that thou art neither cold nor hot why would thou worth cold or hot verse 16 so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth first time I ever heard that scripture I was sitting in the backs of the sanctuary during uh the devil virus time Co right nothing but the devil that's all that was that's not science that's not MediCal that's the devil that's all that was but I was sitting back there I heard that scripture and it struck me like a bolt of lightning boom it just hit me and I was just like out of breath I just felt something in my body I felt that tall I felt worthless I felt embarrassed because I knew and brother Caleb said that I knew he was talking about and I know we all feel convicted sometimes right we're hearing a message and go man how does he know that like no one knew I did that God knows right God knows God knows that day I needed that was my first trip out to Las crues well besides when I played softball but that was my first trip to Cedar Hills when I heard that scripture and that changed my life forever I will never be the same I don't want to be the same right I have trust and faith in the Lord that I will never be that person again and I try to show that to everyone I know my guys at work that I've worked with for 30 years God I'm old but when I I have conversations with them now and a lot of them I know they're curious so when we engage in conver conversations I try to share as much as I can with them without sharing too much sometimes because you might scare them away right or they say okay here he goes again preaching get up and get out of the kitchen right but I try to let them know but what's really cool is a lot of them will say oh brother I see the change I see your walk is different certain conversations I get up and walk out of the kitchen anymore fire station man we're good guys but brother let me tell you it's not a great environment sometimes smoke whatever I don't go back because I know that's not the place for me the Lord trust me to stay here and not to be out there am all right brother Brandon once said the great sacred trust was given to the bride of Christ but understand that that sacred trust for him to give us that sacred trust it has to go both ways that's how I see it it has to go both ways he can't just or we can't just have trust in him and then go do what we want to do and think okay the Lord's going to work it out I know I messed up Lord's going to work it out because when you you think you you can have that relationship with God and then you you backslide understand that yeah we can go to him and we can ask for forgiveness for what we did he hears us he's going to forgive us to see your forgetfulness that song I love that song to see your forget forgetfulness is gone but understand that that comes with some consequence all right now we got to work our we got to work our way back into that favor we never really lose the favor but understand okay the Lord's watching he sees what you're doing he hears what you're saying he sees where you're going all right so we have to make sure that we stay where we're supposed to stay in the Lord like Psalms 188 and I'm kind of bouncing all over the place right now but I want you guys to just understand man that premoral agency I remember when we learned that in Bible study and I'm just going to hit that real quick 100% free moral agency an understanding that you have the opportunity do whatever you want to do in life Lord's not going to stop you free will right Free Will is it perfect will free will perfect will there's a difference right you want to go experiment Lord's going to allow you to go experiment but that's not his perfect will all right so every single day our free moral agency we have to die out to our free moral agency every every single day we have to be free moral agents we have to die out every single day every day is a day of forgive uh forgiveness ask for forgiveness every because we're all doing something amen we may not think about it at the time but while we're driving we go oh I should have said that Lord please forgive me I do it all the time driving good looking second look oh Lord please forgive me I'm like brother brandom I've got the cross hanging on my mirror in my car I do in my charger that charger gets a lot of attention I'm just saying so when I get that look sometimes hey hey you know I'm driving I speak to everyone and I walk I drive drive away and I go man did I speak a little too friendly ah Lord please forgive me if I did I don't know if I did but I just want to make sure that he understands that if I did something wrong Lord please forgive me amen please forgive me I didn't mean to do that all right Psalms 1188 it is better to trust in the Lord than to put confidence in man amen wow how many of you trust man I like that okay no one raised their hand who in here played organized basketball you who in here considers them there you are Moses I've seen you on the court I know you were a star right yeah all right four four seconds left in the game coach call it timeout you guys are down by two all right Moses we're going to run this play through X's O's circles zigzag set the screen Moses going to get the ball shoot the three Moses we win the game coach calls that play for you you trust that coach believe that I'm going to get that ball and make that shot absolutely why can't we trust God exactly he trust that coach Maya All-American 8 years old in track and field she didn't know what she she was doing she was out there having fun playing patty Cades in between events one of the best in the in the country though at the time she didn't know what she was doing but she trusted Uncle Mike she trusted my daughter to coach her up go all the way to Nationals to Witchita Kansas and come home as an All-American number four in the nation you trusted me course brother Will's not in here right how many of you guys go to brother will for a haircut you guys don't trust brother will huh hey when he told me he was a barber I'm like how you're a barber when you don't talk Barber's talk that's like a place of gossip and conversation and sports and okay but if I go to brother will for a haircut and I give him 25 30 bucks whatever it is I you know what I went to get a haircut the other day I've had my St Barbara for nearly 30 years gosh I'm old but well every time I say that but I had the same Barber we're more like brother and sister now than than Barber and customer the guy sitting next to her that has the barber chair next to her young man came in I was in the chair getting my haircut I paid 25 bucks that's my tip included young man came in for a haircut and he's like oh how much for a haircut $38 I was like what that better be the best haircut on Earth which means I'm going to trust him to cut my hair if I pay him $38 right so when you sit in that chair and you get that hair cut you're trusting that that Barbie is going to cut you right all right right why can't we trust God Amen with everything that we do why can't we trust God Amen look at this flashlight when I'm with my guys we we respond to a call we go into a burning structure I've got this Streamlight on my helmet boom right soon as we hit that door building's inflamed fully engulfed smoked dark we can't see anything an adamant object but I've got

pick you pal yeah come on so I I I did say he was going to volunteer but instead I he got volunt told and the reason why I I I picked him is because I I know him a little bit U I know a little bit of

understand that your name is Ezra but here are your options at this point sir you came in here and you disrespected my staff you don't have the proper ID you don't even have a real cell phone and you come in here and you're demanding some unknown amount of chicken sandwiches so here are your options sir you can put it in order and you can buy more chicken sandwiches you can get to the back of the kitchen and you can work to pay for those chicken sandwiches that you have not ordered and you don't have any cash to pay for because I saw your wallet or you can I'll pay for you excuse me sir I'm not done or you can step outside and you can go back home before I go all New Mexico on you and get halap in your face [Music] I I'll buy the chicken sandwiches you're going to pay for the chicken

fantastic Chick-fil-A's down the street this is church Fila thank you very much here are your chicken sandwiches have a good day thank you hold up a minute my boy needs some more feedback what just happened he succumbed to a little bit of pressure and what did he do yeah for sure he didn't have a a lot of great comebacks but this is why I picked him honestly cuz I knew he wasn't going to have all the he he wasn't going to be confrontational with me but my question is let's get him some feedback what did he do wrong something very very wrong happened today just right now what happened say

to any random person that walks in that door do you understand it's for your protection sir for my protection that you mean company protection is there anything else I can help you with today sir have a good day no I what could he do different we are forgetting a very basic principle of Commerce and what is that principle nobody's done it yet what can we do a bad review I got one star only a church Fil-A the bad reviews aren't going to help say that again please did you hear what he said oh that's a good idea what could we do boys and girls can we say it again really nice and Loud bring a receipt why what's the purpose of a receipt it's proof of a purch of a purchase right so if I am a if I am a storefront with any kind of common sense with any kind of morality you bring to me the receipt that you purchase something is a going to look a little bit different let's try it again welcome to church fer how may I help you um I'm here to pick up an order okay and the name uh Thomas

get your ID please this is a police station what do you need an ID for well sir why are you laughing oh well sir uh I need the ID to verify that the person that's picking up this order takes home verification uh well something like a receipt would work well I see that uh there's some chicken paid for but I also see that it's a Jose I would like to believe that I'm giving it to the right person that you didn't just find that receipt outside on the floor we understand each other I would find it on the floor interesting yeah uhhuh so someone that already paid for chicken sandwiches would just give me their receipt yeah pretty inconvenient isn't it here you go sir thank you very much if you have an ID I do have the card number that is on that receipt you have the card I have the card number with your name on it well it is my dad's name on it that's fantastic how about you sir did your dad's not here to pick up so you guys don't want to sell chicken sandwiches it's already sold and paper for it is well I will be I will be leaving a bad review on your website we don't even have a website on Google Maps how else can I help you today I will call my dad and he will ask for a refund okay sure okay let me wait wait wait we don't want to refund let's see if we can work something out how can we work this out sir well I would like to leave a good review for you we don't have a website um Google Maps as you like to keep reminding me okay all right what did he do a little bit different he was confident what else he was what he gave it he gave it back right like he's like he didn't just stand there and he didn't definitely didn't pay cash he wasn't willing to uh just walk out and leave and say okay well maybe I'll pay for it too he stood his ground as the other guys did too but he stood his ground he stood his ground with some confidence is that true right all right thank you very much appreciate it all right can you have your sandwich no you cannot all right um what's the reason why we bring that up today um if we can we put up the the slide on there um the reason why we brought that up today is because I wanted to share like a little simple little thought with you guys about keeping your receipt um and about righteous and dig ation it is almost April and and keeping your receipts is important for a lot of things here in the natural right it's important for when we do our taxes April 15's coming up pretty quick it's a lot easier to do with your receipts um but but in the spiritual sense um it's very important to keep our receipts as well because there are certain things boys and girls that are already paid for and certain things that sometimes we are unwilling to stand our ground for and and accept and take what's already ours because our daddy did pay for it okay so if we could go on to the next slide here's what I want to show you I want to share something with you to hopefully help you out brother Caleb asked me to come over here and to Hype you guys up and I think he got the wrong guy because I'm not really like a hype man kind of guy that's more like brother Caleb Ali you know what I mean that's more like Seth and and Omar they their hype guys but I'm hoping that I put the word out there for you guys and maybe the word will hype you up a little bit okay so so what we are going to do right now is we are going to think what I want you to do is I want you to think about a problem that you have and I see a lot of people some some of you guys have notes and if you have somewhere to take notes um I want you to write it down and if you don't you can just write it write it down in in in your mind I want you to think about a problem that you had like Ezra had like Noah's had or Bo had excuse me and I want you to think about your hunger think about your desire to please your dad to go do what he asked you to do whatever whatever that that version of your problem is right now something that's that's ailing you think about what that problem is right now give you 10 seconds so the mic made it very clear we're all battling some all the time maybe we're battling maybe our problem is lday by the time Tuesday hits around I kind of sometimes use bad language when I get around such and such a friend maybe our problem is is like well on Friday nights well usually I like to do this that and the other maybe our problem is well when nobody's looking here's what I like to do whatever is your problem you don't have to say it out loud I'm just get I I want you to think about that for one second and then what I want you to do is I want you to take that one word or that one little phrase that you wrote down and I want you to rewrite it underneath it in a sentence that says this never again will I confess whatever that problem is Right amen and and then we're going to piggyback off of what brother Caleb spoke yesterday and say I have hope because blank and then and then and then leave leave the blank empty for now and remember what brother Caleb told us yesterday he said that hope hope the the definition the actual definition of hope is to have high expectations to have trust to have confidence to anticipate with great pleasure an expectation with the guarantee okay so that guarantee part again if you come and you purchase something it is guaranteed that whatever it is that you purchase when you can prove it that you are you should be expected to receive that good or that service right it would be unjust for me to for example order a couch and then go pick up said couch and then say I'm sorry well I don't make that couch anymore it why is it unjust because I have the invoice you can see that it's paid and full I fully expect that you are going to give me that cou right funny story this is this is true one day I ordered a couch I went to pick up the couch and I got to the place and the lady's like yeah well uh I'm sorry uh the couch isn't here I was like okay that's that's that's fine you told me two weeks ago when I was supposed to pick up my couch two weeks ago that the couch wasn't here you told me that it would be here today I expect my couch today I love and they said well sir the couch isn't here I was like well I don't know where it is but you better get it here and they're like well sir and let me talk to the manager so they she she walked away she comes back and she goes oh I know why the couch isn't here sir like okay like it's because we don't make that couch anymore wow I like okay I don't care right I don't care if y'all make that couch anymore I bought that couch when you did make it and I fully expect that you are going to have that couch here for me today because two weeks ago I was here you told me to wait two more weeks I waited two weeks and I'm tired of sitting on the floor yeah so she's like okay excuse me sir let me get uh let let me make a phone call and okay okay okay okay hello sir and I said no and she [Applause] goes first of all you see an invoice with somebody's name is Garcia just assume yeah you just assume everybody's not brother Caleb Duron around here some of us do speak Spanish so she incorrectly assumed that I wouldn't speak Spanish she said all this right so here's what happened here's what happened a truck uh like a little little datson pickup truck with some Sonora license plates came screeching around the corner about 20 minutes later with my couch right with an ottoman on top of it that was given to me for free and with a check for 200 bucks for the inconvenience why because I had a little bit of righteous indignation and I said look I don't like to create a problem two weeks ago when I was supposed to get it I you I I expected it it wasn't there I gave you some Grace here I am I want it now and I refused to say who can I buy another count yeah right I refuse to say well I don't know like maybe I can uh come back in two weeks and maybe you'll have it no why because the righteous indignation stood up Rose up and you know what at some point you just expect what's rightfully coming to you you expect what is already paid for to be given to you and it would be unjust it would have been unjust for that company not to have given me that couch that I paid for that was paid for already right so here's what we're going to do you're going to rewrite that sentence or do it in your brain or do it on your paper and you're going to say never again will I confess that I cuss never again will I confess that I'm a drunk never again will I confess that I have anxiety never again will I confess that I am Unworthy of of the Gospel never again will I confess whatever problem that you have that you suffer with only you know you're going to say I have hope because and then we're going to fill in some blanks in a minute do that in your brain if you don't have it if you do have notes do it with you right now can we go to the next slide please I'm going to give you an example never again will I confess I can't this is an easy one for us to do I have hope that I can because I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me Philippians 4:13 let me tell you something Philippians 4:13 is my receipt anytime the devil tries to tell me that I can't actually yes I can you know why because my daddy already purchased it and my daddy gave me the receipt it's right here okay so this is exactly why we went through this scenario why so you can see if your righteous indignation can rise up for a chicken sandwich then it should be able to rise up for these things that are written in here for all these receipts that you have for you let's go to another one never again will I confess addiction do I have a receipt for addiction boys and girls amen do I have a receipt for addiction up there do I have a receipt for overcoming addiction I have hope because where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so I am no longer going to confess addiction do you know why because Liberty I have the receipt for my freedom already never again will I confess addiction because I have hope because who he whom the sun set free is free indeed there is my receipt right there John 8:36 let's go to the next one we're going to do one more never again will I confess anxiety this is a big one this is a big one and I I I hear it too much it's because I suffer with anxiety I suffer with anxiety and I'm not telling you that you don't but what I am telling you is you have a receipt for it and if your righteous indignation will stand up you can have your freedom from your anxiety and here are your receipts I have hope a guarantee that the anxiety is gone why because I am casting all my cares upon Him who cares for me there's one receipt I left you three because we talk about this too much I never again will I confess anxiety I have a guarantee that I don't have anxiety because he said my peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you you I do not give as the world gives here is your diagnosis for your anxiety I do not give as the world gives do not let your hearts be troubled and do not be afraid that's John 14:27 and here's my favorite one and this is an NIV version like Mike said because it helps us a little bit more and it's written differently than it is in King James never again will I confess anxiety I have a guarantee because when anxiety was great within me your consolation brought me joy these these are our receipts now if you go to the next slide I I I know all of us don't have our phone I created a list I I got you started with 25 receipts for some of the problems that we have if you go ahead and scan that I know it's kind of irregular but if you go ahead and scan that it's listed on there you'll be on there as viewer only okay if you request access to it and you have a receipt for something that's not on there will you please request access and help us keep a list and then we can keep it there and then anytime that we are struggling with something anytime Church filet or devil filet or whoever sends you away and says you know what if you don't have your ID if you don't have a receipt then you don't get what you have already purchased it'll be right there for us it'll be easy somewhere that we can easily look up if you have a Mac you press you press crlf and then you can find whatever problem that you have just by searching it okay and so so again please understand if if you're willing to have some righteous indignation over a chicken sandwich if you're willing to have some righteous indignation over a sofa how about our healing how about our salvation and remember remember that sometimes when we have that indignation and we come and we demand our chicken sometimes that chicken will be ready right away you get it instantly and sometimes you might have to stand there and wait for them to cook up that chicken sandwich and we're using a metaphor you understand right but sometimes when you're are waiting for your deliverance from anxiety sometimes when you're waiting for your deliverance from sickness sometimes that chicken sandwich will come right away and it'll be instant I've seen it my son was sick one day for two days in a row sick sick sick sick sick couldn't eat had a fever all day long he was lethargic and it was it was awful and then we got sick and righteous indignation rose up and we took him to we took him to the to the to the minister and what did the minister do he prayed for him he pulled out the receipt he said Lay Your Hands on the sick and they will recover and there was the receipt and what happened chicken sandwich came to him instantly he was like this crying and then he prayed for amen and he was up and he asked for food it was instant we got that chicken sandwich instantly you know how old he was he was three he was 3 years old and the faith of a three-year-old he raised them up instantly you were there you saw it and so were you it was was instant and then the next time he got sick I held him and I'm like Bubba you'll be all right Bubba you're going to be okay it's going to be okay you want to go to QT you want to go to QT pal trying to see if he'll be like yeah I want to go to QT right no Daddy I don't want to go to QT Daddy and I was like you know what the promise isn't only to the pastor the promise isn't only to the minister the promises are to daddies the promises are to Sons the promises are to daughters all we have to do is pull out the the receipt that's right brother so I pulled out the receipt and I said you know what Levi I'm going to pray for you son and and you're going to be healed and son you have the faith I know you have the faith all you got to do is when I bring out the receipt all you got to do is believe it for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes and so I pulled it out I pulled out the receipt and I said Son In The Name Of The Lord Jesus Christ and you know what he said Daddy can we go to QT now wow it was instant and sometimes it will come instant but sometimes it won't come instant it's not right brother Diego sometimes it will take a little while for that for that healing for that chicken sandwich to cook yes sir but you will eventually get it when you come with that receipt isn't that right Judah isn't it that's right so here is for you and I hope it pumps you up and I hope I get my inbox flooded with people that have receipts that want to put them in there and share all you got to do is just create click right click add add a add a row underneath and then put it in there never again will I confess XYZ because and then put in the receipt because the receipt is the one that's going to heal us if you're if you're um whoever's coming up to song Lead if you'll come up I love you
