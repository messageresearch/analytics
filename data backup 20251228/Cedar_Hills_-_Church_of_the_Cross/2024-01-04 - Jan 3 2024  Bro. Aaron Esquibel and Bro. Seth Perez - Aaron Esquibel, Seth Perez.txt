such a beautiful atmosphere amen while we're standing let us open our Bibles to the Book of Matthew chapter 5 verse 48 and can you just smile at your neighbor Shake bless you brother Ronnie amen and as we heard on Sunday the word of God reads be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect amen you may be seated now we remember on Sunday that we are not perfect in our own doing we're not perfect because we don't make any mistakes but we're perfect because we serve a perfect God and we've accepted a perfect sacrifice amen and as I heard the word coming forth on Sunday I felt like our pastor just making arrows for us so I didn't have to look very far for inspiration I'm just going to continue on with what I felt the Holy Spirit led me to and now we heard that we must see Christ in every scripture amen amen and it's easy to pick the Bible up and maybe I'll just pick a random verse and it says and it came to pass when they came and looked on elab and they looked upon elab if I don't get that portion of scripture well as we instructed well we go back and we read it again and we read it till we can see Christ in the scripture but then we took it a step further and we found out if I can't see Christ in every aspect of this Bible in every aspect of my life then I've got to go back into my heart and I got to find out who's in control there and that's when things start getting rough because our lives are the greatest message that will ever be preached and nobody else has to tell me where I'm lacking I believe each one of us know within our heart where we lack or we fail the Lord and I have a little uh title that the lord gave me and it's the small details and under there I put I've got to be my meticulous now if you don't mind I'm going to just read a quote for you of our founding pastor and it reads like this this is what the Holy Spirit told me yesterday the reason people are not getting it is because they don't have details they don't take care of the small details in their life and I said I don't understand you right Lord he said simply they have despised the day of small things small things he says again they are up here trying to get big things when they don't take care of the details down here as you are with your car as you are with your house as you are with your own personal appearance am that's the way you are with God you've got to be meticulous now that word meticulous it means showing great attention to detail very careful and precise and I believe that's the time we're living in I don't know about you but I want to be meticulous from the way I speak the way I think the way I act the way I present myself to people the way I am in the wherever I am I want to be conscious of these details now I just happen to look up what details meant of course I had an idea but I thought this was pretty good details it's a small Detachment of troops given a special Duty it's an ingredient and if we go back to Sunday our Pastor said we pray for help but when the help comes we're blinded because it's not in our taste he said you don't want him in other words you don't want the details you don't want this ingredient you don't want this element amen amen and so if we could open our Bibles we're going to read about a man in the Bible who was given some specific uh uh details if we could I'm not going to read it I'm going to just kind of tell you all story but it's going to be 1 Samuel chapter 15 and so we find out that there was a man in the Bible named Saul and one day God anointed prophet Samuel he came to Saul and he said the Lord sent me to you I'm GNA you're going to be anointed king over Israel and he goes on to say and verse three he says now I got a special uh Duty for you to do a special Duty kind of like those details we read about earlier he says I want you to go to the land of the amalekites and I want you to destroy them their children their men their women their o their sheep all their livestock everything that has to do with them I want you to annihilate it so Saul gathered the people together he got a couple thousand men together and the scripture said that Saul came to the city of am and he laid waiting in the valley and so when he was waiting there in the valley he got his own smart idea he thought you know what I think I'm going to those are some pretty goodlooking goats those Ox look pretty fat I think I'm GNA keep those oh and so what he did instead of destroying everything as the Lord commanded him he began to hide certain things the things that the Lord told him to get rid of he put them to the side I can use these for a rainy day and I began to think of that you know we can come and get advice from the ministry or even the pastor and he tells us exactly what to do in our lives and what do we say sometimes H I'm going to do it anyway I got to just try it for myself has anybody ever thought that you hear somebody tell you hey you shouldn't go down that road but we say I'm just going to I got to just try it and what that is is it's stubbornness it's stubbornness and that's the way we are we get stuck in our own way and God can't do anything for us because he gives us the remedy and we refuse to take it you know it's you see people as brother Bram says dying on the footsteps of the doctor's office the doctor has the prescription for you he tells you what to take how to take it but because we're stubborn and we're stuck in our routines and and habits we don't take the prescription and it comes to this we can't blame God for anything everything we have need of it's laying right at our fingertips you can receive anything you have needed so I believe it's time to look into the mirror stop looking at other people there's no excuse for our actions prophet of God said God God has the joy he's got the power unlimited he's got healing salvation Glory glor goodness Mercy but if the subject refuses to receive the remedy then it's his fault so whatever I go through in life me personally I never look to blame anybody if somebody gets gets me upset they really didn't get me upset I let myself get upset at them if same thing with being hurt you know I let that person get to me in that way that's when I got to go back into my heart and find out if I'm reflecting Christ in every aspect of my life so back to Saul you know he started to put all these things to the side and when he returned back uh the prophet Samuel was not very happy with him he walks up and he says well how did it go she went great I did everything you told me to do and while Samuel's talking to him he says uh he hears sheep bleeding in the background he can hear all the cow and he says well what's that what's that sound and and then so Saul wants to blame the people and he says uh oh it was the people that wanted to keep all these [Music] animals not only that but he didn't even kill the king when who he was instructed to Smite and that King was standing there and Samuel had to kill him and the Lord didn't visit Saul until his dying day the Bible says until his death bed and as I was just thinking on that I said Lord let me not be as Saul just getting rid of the things that I want to get rid of picking and choosing but let me just get rid of everything that's not you from the biggest thing to the smallest he said to kill it all and so in closing I just want to share a little story with you and I'm sure we've all heard it but I'm sure there's a lot of new people here too and it's just uh you know sometimes we we've heard the story many times that or the phrase the pardon is only a pardon if it's accepted as a pardon oh but I've always asked myself how do I know I've been pardoned and how do I know I received it as a pardon well if you pay attention you'll be able to answer that question at the end of the story and it says during the time of the Revolutionary in the United States it was said that a soldier was tried and court marshaled for a certain crime this Soldier was to be shot at a certain date in Sunrise the day before some of them went to this notable president and begged for their friend's life and the president being in a hurry picked up a small piece of paper remember it's the day of small things right and he wrote on it I pardon this man signed his name Abraham Lincoln Abraham Lincoln and the carrier brought the piece of paper to the cell and he told the man you're free as the man looked at this little piece of paper it doesn't seem official I just don't believe it I'll never leave here oh he rejected it because it was on a small piece of paper it wasn't on a great letter head stamped by the president so the next morning the man died he was sentenced by a firing squad then the paper was written with the president's name the man is pardoned and they shot him after the president had pardoned him so it was tried in federal court and here was here was the decision that a pardon is not a pardon except it's received as a pardon so John 3:16 is a pardon to every Mortal man and woman if it's received as a pardon but if it's not you're still condemned so back to our question how do I know that I've been pardoned how do I know I've received the pardon well you've got to ask yourself the question are you relieved from that guilt that's inside of you if you're still carrying the guilt then you haven't been received that pardon see After we receive our pardon we receive Purity with that pardon the Bible says the worshipper once purged has no more conscience of sin so if you're really pardon the very guilt the very desire it's left you it's all gone Purity goes with genuine pardoning pardon generates purity and as I think on those things that's what I have been meditating on ever since I you know a couple weeks ago our brother Tommy Jr heach preached a beautiful message and it was just simply the scripture you know whatsoever things are pure holy meditate on these things so I mean as soon as a negative thought comes to my mind now instead of sitting there thinking man where did this thought come from before you know it you're already living back in the past but if you just do a quick abstract it doesn't take very long it's just that quick you shut that thought out that's not a pure and holy thought and the enemy starts to lose his his his grasp on your mind but the only thing that's gonna really set you free is to have that life that was released on Calvary living in our hearts amen amen as brother Seth comes up God bless each one of you amen amen bless you may the Lord bless you this this evening and let us stand for the reading of the word and open our books to the our Bible to acts chap 7 verse 55 and the word of God says this but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said behold I see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of God then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and ran upon him with one Accord and may the Lord Jesus add blessings to the reading of the word and let let us pray dear gracious Heavenly Father what a privilege it is to be here in your house Lord something Lord that I never want to get old and Lord I ask that you just Lord just just bless your people tonight Lord Lord whatever need they may have here tonight Lord Lord you are very much alive Lord as you were way back then Lord and we love you with all our heart Lord in Jesus name amen amen may be seated well we started uh the inspiration for Steven was given to us by our pastor earlier in the year last year and once you read these stories of these Martyrs it it makes you take a good look at your life because we are very privileged in this in this country and even though we've some have felt oppression everybody in this country has some sort of Rights and I've never been arrested for saying how much I love the Lord we have that freedom here and you can look at a different way and say well I don't think you do based on the spirituality of this nation but I'm talking the physical part and someone like Sten what a courageous man of God that he is it blows my mind how courageous he was to be able to face the religious leaders of that day and tell them that they were doing wrong they were absolutely doing wrong in the sight of God and they themselves these leaders you saw the play and they had their own agenda their own political uh purpose to control this church Ste wasn't going to have anything to do with that and the Bible said it says that he's being he him being filled of the Holy Ghost I don't know if there's anybody that's full of the Holy Ghost tonight if you need some encouragement tonight I want to tell you something the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever does it thrill your soul to know that he's the same when everything in our lives are so out of control when people are trying to persuade you or influence you to see their point of view Jesus Christ is still the same Chang and he sent his holy ghost here he's in this house it was noised at one point in Jerusalem even in the city of Capernaum that Jesus Christ is in the house does it still through your soul know that Jesus Christ is in the house of God thrill you when the world comes against you when the world comes against you maybe a brother with the wrong Spirit maybe some sickness is coming against you even cancer but you could stand up and say Jesus Christ he's in my house what should I fear today and stepen being filled with the Holy Ghost looked up dead fastly now they were about to Stone him at this point but it didn't matter how courageous that this man how courageous that this man even after he told him he stiff NE why he scolded them for the wrong things that they were doing and as they got together they had enough they were angry they said we will not have that no more with you Stephen we won't have that no more with they're not going to put that put up with that this is our Temple but they forgot who was standing in front of them you see Jesus was Jesus died for our sins and in himself what a great sacrifice he was the great sacrifice that he laid down and many in time of our life have someone maybe a Jesus in our life where when someone needs help from you you can say look to Jesus and that's fine it's amazing to point people to the Lord but there's got to be a point when you point people or people should be able to say that the Lord is in you they should be able to identify that the Lord is in your house has anybody ever said that wow that man's full of the Holy Ghost has anybody ever said that about and maybe you need to do some homework I want to be courageous like Stephen see he focused on something let me rephrase that he focused on someone in heaven it was the whole reason for his purpose in life and the one that gave him life it was the Lord Jesus and even though when they were angry and they wanted to beat him to death they were they grabbed all their Stones he still focused on the Lord he was focused with the detail they were going to do whatever they were going to do to him he didn't say oh guys let's uh rethink this right I was just kidding you know you know uh you guys can still have your church you can believe one way I'll go over here and I'll believe this way right this is the truth but you can believe your madeup truth and that wasn't good enough Sten that wasn't good enough for him because he was full of faith it was the belief in God that he had because the word martyr it means it's a witness you all been Witnesses haven't you seen the glory of God doesn't it like move you or something doesn't it fill your soul so when the world says your Prophet made a lot of mistakes why you know that's not true there something inside of you you can say no that's not right watch not on my watch he God don't make no mistakes you know this you are the people of promise and he looked up up to heaven why it reminds me reminds me of a story with Peter and John and they go past the gate called beautiful and there is a lame man at the gate and he's asking for Ms he wants somebody to help him out only he's expecting maybe a little money little bit of Charity little bit of food but he hit the right guys he hit the right the right guys came along the men of God came along the apostles came and they passed by him do you have any arms for me now this man being lame he was on the ground he was on the ground and all he could do is ask for some help up he was already at the bottom he didn't have anywhere else to go and he thought he might spend the rest of his life charity a little something to get him to the next day but he said do you have any silver or gold for me you know what they said Silver and Gold Have we none he he touched the right guys filled with the Holy Ghost who didn't were very rich but they had something far more precious than but they told him look on us we're here the same Lord Jesus you seen him go away he's not totally God you don't see his physical body here today but I tell you today it's my responsibility to tell the people I want to be just like Peter and if you need something tonight don't be afraid to look up don't be afraid to look on me and don't see me say the Lord Jesus in me because the Lord Jesus is here for you tonight touch your body start of seeing you on the ground just look up don't look at me look at the Lord Jesus in me and that's what we need to do this year we all have been Witnesses I've been able to see different things to see how the Lord is using our pastor and our ministry around the world what an amazing job I'm so happy to be a part of it but there's got to be a point in your life when you will say Lord send me when you will say not just throw all the blame hey go go this guy will help you even though will my P my father go hey go if you need some help go yeah go talk to my dad but there's got to be a point when we reach say the same Lord Jesus is that in the ministry is the same Lord Jesus in my heart why the Lord can use you in different ways but there's got to be a point of responsibility when we just don't let brother Caleb he can do everything and what you can but it's a body and you got to move you got to move somebody because the Bible says when he Peter went to talk to that lame man arise take up your bed go walking who will go walking today who can arise from that lowly stature their lowly situation focus on the Lord and obey his voice who can do that who is willing to even be a sacrifice lot of times even in youth I feel that sometimes the kids want to see what are we gonna get out of you what is brother Seth gonna do today oh what's brother Aaron going to do oh that's the same we've been doing that for the past 10 years but many times we complain about these things and we have these negative expectations so as soon as I mess up we say oh wow that was a waste of time it's a waste of time because you haven't looked up you're too busy looking down what people are going to do so what are you going to do the Bible says let no man despise thy youth that despises like looking down on you what can the youth do and they're always selfish on their phones I don't see them do much around the house what will they do but I tell the youth it is our time rise you're not hearing me to arise from the situation you're in maybe a spiritual death maybe you're paralyzed spiritually in your legs and you can't walk and you can't it's hard to make a sacrifice and it's hard to go to youth it's hard to go to church all they're having another service but I tell you today there is still hope for you this is a new year and the Lord Jesus is telling you to R from your condition get it's time for you to stand it's time for you to stand up for the Lord for Jesus you are actors in The Great drama and he's looking to see if you're going to fill your position don't be down this year maybe you need some encourag the Lord Our God he is the one God he is The Great I Am there a nobody like my God the same Lord Jesus I would heal the lame the blind those that are sick that have a broken heart the that needs some help is here today do you believe that he's the same in every detail there ain't nobody like the Lord Jesus and nobody like the Bride of Jesus Christ praise the Lord if you need some encouragement let me tell you what David says because David was a man of encouragement and most of the time you find him crying out to the Lord but he knew something he would say in Psalms 2 verse three but thou oh Lord oh maybe I have it wrong just go with me right here that's the wrong one but David would say oh Lord thou art a shield for me my glory and the lifter up my head I don't know if you know that tonight you feel some you feel down tonight maybe gained a little weight over the holidays and there's a lot of sickness going around but I want to tell you he's going to lift your head but you got to look up say you need to focus come on Focus but you got to get from your lowly station maybe you're a little tonight you're a little tonight but you got to do everything in your power instead of looking at your phone lift your head body instead of just looking at your phone lift it up I watch The Miraculous happen David says I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from which cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord heaven he made the Heaven and the Earth and he's coming here tonight and he wants to lift your head he wants to see your eyes he wants to gaze into your soul and he wants to tell you he have you ever told somebody you love them you got to focus love you Pop love you because it's very important maybe you young people understand or not there's nothing wrong telling your parent love them because our father always wants to see your eyes he wants you to look up to him because there's great healing for you he's a shield for you I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills from whence cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth and as the musicians come it's very important because sometimes I need straightening up and I got good parents to straighten me up they're very good at it and I need it sometimes you get beaten up by the ministry and it hurts but it's all for a purpose and we heard that on Sunday how God could use these different men who sometimes is like wow the Lord used him but I want to tell you God gives you a little bit of whiping once in a while maybe he turns you around a few times and it's all about he lays you on your back for a purpose maybe when I can't pay attention I need some tough love but he lays you on your back this is our Prophet here speaking he lays you on your back so you can look [Music] up but Lord it hurts why am I going through these things why is these sicknesses afflicting my body don't you think that they always said that about the people that Jesus would heal which one of his family sinned what did he do he must have done something bad that he deserve that and the Lord Jesus would tell them all this is is to show the glory of God why Steven just didn't die in vain who was watching St who was watching him he came for one maybe SA everybody knows who Paul is now but St decided to make a stand for the Lord he decided to sacrifice his body because there was a Greater Hope waiting for him would you bow your heads sister Roxy Roxy the Lord knows what you need sister Roxy and if you would like to come the ministers would like to come the Lord is here [Music] today he is here sister [Music] Roxy your whole body you're in the right place Roxy the Lord's here I didn't know that my pastor told me but I didn't know about you know but the Lord's going to heal you sister Roxy if it's not today that process is going to continue and even going your soul far more than you ever want just look and focus on the Lord raise your hands Lord Jesus you are the great Jehovah Lord You're the great healer Lord most of all you love us so much Lord to see us where we were Lord alienated from you Lord people that couldn't love anything Lord and he showed us what love was Lord Lord I I I I'm standing here Lord who not only wants to heal her eye Lord but her entire body
