your heart in your eyes that you have heard and you have seen and you have received the word of god i won't take too much time of this this evening but i want to to to get us to to some understanding

the word of god on wednesday brother brother bro my brother william williams yeah he is so smooth and i appreciate the word of god i am very very happy that the lord jesus is here tonight you know the bible says that he said that he would be there where there's two or three and uh and so we're confident that he is here right now or indonesia you can look at your neighbor just tell them that he's here god bless you god bless you charity god bless you braden and all everybody from alaska you know we're we're we're grateful that god is here tonight how many believe that he is here okay i got to say that again how many believe that he is tonight you know this this week and we're not going to focus on the bad innova we're going to focus on on what we're supposed to be doing but i want you to notice that right now our country is in such a divided mess i believe it was last sunday a chaplain to open the 117th congress he prayed this prayer and i don't want to get him wrong but but he prayed this prayer and i'm going to get it so that you you will know what he prayed and he prayed this prayer he finished up out his pr his prayer terminator known by many names and faiths you wonder why why three days later that that that that extremists entered into the us capital you and when you wind up and don't know if you're praying to god or to a hindu deity what do you know that can ever keep you safe away from the wiles of the devil this methodist minister yesterday should have known better because you we only serve one lord jesus christ in 1774 the chaplain of the congress concluded with all these things we ask through the merits of thy son jesus christ our savior in 2021 we said but as far as america has fallen in america this is how much the bride of jesus christ has risen because our foundation is not built upon the constitution but his word would never it would remain eternal it dwells in my heart wells in my ground wealth in my ear it is me it's for you the word and it talks about every person in here claims to be a head of the household every man in here that claims to be right with god every man in here that has come to the stature of a perfect yeah because god didn't come to make christians the message of jesus christ was not to make christians not christian was to make stature of a perfect man to bring us into the unity of the spirit he wanted to bring us there was a man 2 000 years ago by and we say what a great plan god has he was kicked on grandpa remains a plan until there is a manifestation of that plan there is a plan so in the seventh [Applause] what he has but then in christ is the mystery of god revealed he picks it back up again because he wants you to understand that's the first expression was for god to be revealed completely in christ but it does not stop there the first manifestation of the plan of salvation after six seals but the next process is for him to have preeminence that would be the manifestation of the sons of god this time now here we are division i got this from my brother william consigned we were having a hard time about that time established and understand and to his daughter jesus he only had a vision to heal his daughter now how many of you cuantos ustedes or how many of us we say unless god shows me directly i won't do nothing about it you know it's another day many of us do know [Music] now this woman would have never gotten healed yes if she would have believed it just like that but she started going into understanding i believe that he is absolutely the son of the most high i believe that in him dwells the spirit of god it dwells in that man you know we were talking about this how beautiful it is to see everybody at the parking lot before the church even that's awesome it's two minutes till 10. it's so tiring oh man and just wait till after service me and my wife are going to finish that argument the song leader is saying raise up your hands people are even fighting to be the first one to church so this woman is do something for other people and then she says i believe that if i could get close enough i believe that if i could get close enough really really have you noticed how beautiful the church services are because you're here an hour and 15 before the church ever starts and you're starting to think about the things of god no i love the lord he's healed me he's giving me peace he's giving you'd be surprised how many people get upset because they can't sit up here at 8 25 right front row center scene all of a sudden church seats are at a premium you know why god is doing something that the enemy is doing his things and enemies god is also getting upset for that reason but this is the woman i believe if i can only get close to you now i ain't got no money no tengo dinero and i'm a poor person i don't know his attitude no that's what you do he might require certain things to spend all my money on the doctors but if i could only wind my way amen that's the way brother brown says to believe it jesus did not have didn't have no vision about her jesus i gotta say it again because jesus said this okay i don't do nothing unless i see my father do it and here she was projected now we understand i believe what the rapture is located the rapture is as we heard to take by force you got a great job and the image was smitten so that the supernatural could taste the feeling of death where do we understand the scripture at don't ask me the world thinks we're just a bunch of holy rollers but when god sees us la vistion israel was supposed to be saved israel only israel israel in the vision they were god's people they were we were people that were just didn't have we were robbers and paul captures the revelation and some were such of you some of you were these people are gonna do you are people a man amen a man a man a man a man and a man and a man new number and a man not a man not a man a man a man a man do you know what this man's name is his name is jesus christ the name there is only one mediator between god and man and that is the i'm [Music] became a hiding place but you shall see we saw the restoration restoration we saw the plan of salvation we saw that man coming back we said he's our hiding place what was happening and the first thing i saw were feet i have been sent forth from the presence of god i presented it i gotta tell i gotta tell you something right here i gotta tell you just something right here okay you saw you saw the project that was going on today and he's telling me how the service is going to run sunday morning and he tells me about the project and then i tell him 60 years ago you're way too excited right now january 8th 1961 yeah as brother branham is preaching revelation chapter 4 the angel of the lord of hearts drawing in the back of the church seven church ages now those that were in attendance look at said that the angel of the lord they said it was brother branham that went with his finger and put light there he pulls a looser you know why it is a plan for you to be saved but it is a vision of a manifestation of you coming into being we're not doing this tonight he got sick said opinion till the light once again became a hiding place when we understand what god has done for us here you're going to understand this when brother brown says that your pastor will determine your eternal i know that god hears him i know that god will do anything for him i gotta force myself into the vision i might not be in the vision but i gotta force myself and a covert 32-2 and a covert icomo refugio from the tempest as rivers of the dry place when we come to the knowledge of the truth we understand this antenna we serve a living god we serve a living resurrected lord but until the plan we got becomes elijah the prophet came with the message i understand that our founding pastor put the church in order maybe that's to you this morning regardless of how little we are how low we are how impure we are how unholy we are how sick we are how afflicted we are the law of god's spirit that laid the spirit to the death by his word makes it obey him i'm going to say it again it does not matter your condition the love of life the light of either that is in that spirit there's not dentistry it's your sickness obey the word all you have to do is start doing this i know god lives in that man you come with the understanding i heard the word of god this morning i know i know god lives in that man i know there's healing in that man i know there's my deliverance in that man whatever i need is in that man it's not to force the issue foreign that do not believe that miracles can happen how many here have broken the law right miracles can happen miracles happen in your life sister immediately
