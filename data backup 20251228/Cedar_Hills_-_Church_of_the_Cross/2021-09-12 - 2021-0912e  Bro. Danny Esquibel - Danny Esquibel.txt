more [Music] than me [Music] [Music] is [Music] you are [Music] oh you [Music] are you than you are [Music] jesus [Music] and feel your lasting is [Music] salty [Music] uh [Music] and jesus is [Music] apparently you're privileged to be in god's house this evening amen how many enjoyed the message this morning amen let's give unto the lord jesus let's go straight to the scripture so we can have you be seated so you're not standing too long and it's found in second timothy chapter 1 verse 12. for the which cause i also suffer these things nevertheless i am not ashamed for i know whom i have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day i want to read that again and i want brother jimmy to interpret it for me as it reads in spanish in espanol so read it in spanish and then and then english translate it for me for this cause that i i suffer but no i am not ashamed and i am sure that he is powerful enough to keep my deposit until that day wow amen now you have to have a certain assurity to know what has been deposited how many can say amen to see them in now i gotta tell you all if uh for some reason because it's feeling i'm feeling a little dizzy up here all right i said you're supposed to if uh i was to die in church i would be just perfectly content so don't worry about it [Applause] now what do you know establish well you ask people today or you tell people especially young people especially you need to do this uh like let me ask you a question how many brought your bibles and so i'm only going to do this because i heard this this morning how many were able to catch the sermon of uh that brother caleb preached this morning right well as soon as we left church this morning i got onto their website what's wrong you don't catch your bible oh no no people yeah like well then borrow one from somebody to raise it that's almost like uh when you ask there's three kinds of believers in every church right no can somebody here point out the unbeliever to me because that's what we tend to do right i know that brother oh yo and the doctor tells you here's your prescription amen i'm not gonna uh doctor gives you a prescription and you go back to for your checkup and as human beings what's the first thing that we do right i want to know i want to know something now there was a man in the bible of your number that sounds pretty simple right tell your voice and see you it would be pretty simple if we said take turn off our phones and don't bring them pictures let me tell you how i think i can only tell you how i think it is oh and then i thought well i have a lot of notes on there oh then i have to do something else reputation and what we find out that he was a leper right so one day there was a little young handmaid avia and she had been taken captive during the war and she was serving in the in the house of neyman um there are certain levels of of preaching so there was this man and he was like i said so this girl she was in the house of neyman and she knew yeah that the days of miracles hadn't passed in israel abraham bought alright but not the way that we think but right we think that it costs money but we find out salvation is free kind of like some people i know right i've traveled around with some of the ministers some guys they come with the duffel bag how did i what the backpack from right i think it was when we went to colombia colombia he didn't say nothing but he kind of like looked at me they got four big old uh stupid cases on wheels [Music] all right that was neyman right so here he goes now and so when the king of israel uh you know he probably was like a lot of us right when he got over to the house he expected for the prophet to come out because he was right he didn't even have the courtesy to come outside right he says go dip myself in the jordan well i can get myself over in syria i came all the way over here to hear that there's a lot of cleaner rivers over there right amen but then naaman's servant he said my lord right he said he go do all that he has told me to do right let's have if he would have asked you to do something unimaginable right correct that's what happens with many of us today we despise the day of small things we get all upset and i am persuaded especially and i am persuaded that nothing that there's nothing in this life but for him to come in and deposit why does worldliness come into like we start to worry about like it goes like this with neyman we start worrying about a nap our living inside you must now brother branham says he says now how does worldliness creep into the church oh it comes in by netflix right it comes in by uh intraport hulu or it comes in by twitter or twitter hey how does it come in almost see this way i like to write notes gotta be [Laughter] i have it on my phone though oh yeah i have it right here then you go to read in the bible and you find out none of these things that jesus said was going on in the church signs shall follow them that believe yes but it doesn't follow and don't follow what jesus said they shall follow them that believe not maybe perhaps they will they will for a certain amount of time why certainly it will rouse the indignation of a true servant you know preaching is the easiest thing you can do oh just get the nerves out after a while right because when we preach the minute you say something somebody's going to start watching as soon as the minister says one thing i'm going to i'm gonna find out something about him that i can get him no we don't do that how many how many amen right a right this is the word of god to me this was the prophet's word no wonder we're getting world but right no wonder the world's creeped into the church so what he's telling me here is this your fault my fault right it's me but right away we want to blast somebody again because they're worldly okay oh that sister oh i started my she did this [Music] we don't want to accept that responsibility but we want to preach we want to hear amen we want to hear glory to god i want to hear jump and shallow now how many wants to displease god no no right correct so we don't want to displease him so what do we do and lead you like a daddy papa would lead his children you are my children i have begotten you to christ through the gospel that day as paul said a chaste version virgin not a version sin don't have course [Music] i'm going to skip that he starts to talk about a young man who killed more limit of squirrels oh he says here so get christ in your heart that's real christ and the holy spirit the same thing holy spirit christ means holy spirit the anointed one and the holy spirit is the anointing you are the one that's anointed and then he can use you to do anything he wants you to but to have one of those gifts outside the body you're a new creature any little thing that's wrong he'll tell you that's wrong don't do it father i didn't mean to do that that many false christs shall arise he wants to make us think that we're strange we heard our testimony of our brother all of us so you know in closing we're going to get ready to close this is the most critical time to know that right how many believe that we're living at the end this is this is the end time now if you think things are bad now i'm not going to go into that but brother branham says that there's more hideous things to come right i think absolutely sure absolutely what has been deposited and what god will keep that for that day as we know many times the question is he wants to just unify us who need now i remember i remember one day we were in silver city and brother tommy calls me i said absolutely sure did you look them at the casino we we i get to his house and it's me and brother anthony anthony and we're in the car we'll be talking we're driving and we come to las cruces to a funeral we're going home and brother tommy's in the back and he says ask me whatever you want you know sometimes they would irritate him when people would bombard him with like questions and he's like oh brother omar was with us when we were going to colorado right oh and omar was driving then brother anthony asked questions and this has been hitting me every day and so i started thinking i thought you know what all these ears i've never looked to see what stick together means it means to unite or to remain united or mutually loyal it's going to take both of us okay there we go so we're stuck together right now have you ever tried to take a mouth tomato a mouth a little wrap yeah okay let's make sure have you ever seen one they like go on those little sticky things you gotta stick together because see the outside spirit is notice watch that watch what i'm saying david had all emotion that the real revival had noticed they shouted god david should have known that now he said david because he should have known he should have known that there was a prophet he said other i found a certain level and one day i came in contact with the lights and guess what i realized my name was no more sinners spider-man i know where i come from man you don't have an ego i know where i'm going my name was changed my number my name [Music] [Applause] [Applause] because my name had been changed the psalm i found out in context that i knew i was given a pastor and i married that man you he's not it's the same is i'm not working to be he we know [Music] now only a pastor would know what is being right i'm talking like literal right literal how many ten sheep right quantus are tendons i i attend horses ten and he starts looking at him he says man these guys i bring him here i beat him take care of him if a lion tries to rise up against the mind who am i slingshot begins to sing air coming the lord is my ship foreign is and then they lay eggs there is what we use and then those larvae turn them to worms and then it goes into the back of the throat alcatraz right um until he died with our heads bowed [Music] [Music] i don't want to be at [Music] we see these things that are happening as we hear more and more testimonies [Music] that was causing that spirit to anoint that person [Music] how many here would want just to to have the lord come and forgive us [Music] amen amen i invite anybody this is more this evening [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] just come now i don't want another service to go by where someone later on down the road says a testimony testimonial [Music] that satan's trying to tell me i'm not good enough [Music] i'm gonna ask the ministers if they would come and help minister to these [Music] brother david [Music] [Music] where it is [Music] the shepherd of my soul [Music] indeed [Music] oh [Music] i [Music] will have made my choice [Music] free [Music] is [Music] of my soul oh [Music] me [Music] is [Music] [Music] it to come here [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] it will come here [Music] oh [Music] is
