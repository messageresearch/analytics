there's three men for the testimony so everybody can have a testimony we'll do just three minutes amen god bless you and may god bless you i just want to give a little short testimony testimonial and this is all for the honor and glory of god okay you know so about probably about a month or so ago a second mess um me and my family we went up to cloudcroft if amelia is a cloudcroft we went up to bluff springs to go look at the waterfall we must have las cascadas you know and um you know we had a good time and as we're leaving there was a guy in a in a black truck and um you know i took i was taking my son to the restroom and i saw this guy he just kept on revving the engine of his truck he and uh so so we're in the restroom estamos it was a diesel truck and he's just there revving the engine he knows i was like what the heck is this guy doing persona so you know so after we come out of the restroom you know i i i don't know for those who have been there to bless springs their restrooms pretty close to where you park for some reason my truck doesn't want to go in reverse i'm a barber not a mechanic right you're not a mechanic you know so so i'm like well i missed you know i go maybe i can maybe try to rock the truck see if it'll engage like we tried it you tried a few things you know and we're like hey i'm sorry there's no there's nothing i can do to help you out and this memory was of our founding pastor and uh you know many years ago when we were cleaning the church there in silver munchosanos and silver my brother roger and sister laura were having uh some troubles with their vehicle you know the car wouldn't start no no so remember bro tommy walking up the stairs at the church there is so i'm there and i was just about to leave i got it bro thank you [Applause] today and forever [Applause] anyone that wants to give another testimony um this was about a [Music] and i made a wrong move and dislocated my kneecap [Music] so this this happened on a monday night and that sunday morning our pastor preached a tremendous message and there was an altar call i came to the front and got prayed for you and an injury that should have taken me at least two months to completely recover that same day i was able to walk and move it and do everything else that i could before yes i just want to give thanks and i'll go over to the lord jesus christ [Music] thank you brother ethan youth if you have a testimony please share your testimony with the lord sure what has god what god has done to you guys um about three months ago um i was driving home from i believe we were out to eat somewhere and i get a call from my grandma yeah and she tells me that my horse is laid flat esta costado and that she couldn't get her up she was trying to rock her up but she wouldn't get out no la podia levanta and she's laid flat out in her stall so i walk in the stall and i just i i didn't know what else to do but try to rock her up okay and i knew that we had to get her to the vet as soon as possible [Music] and so i told my nana to get the truck started to get the trailer hooked up and that i would be right there with her and in that moment i just put my hand on her yo and i called the great physician on the scene and i swear to you she knew exactly who i was calling on the scene and so i let her out of the crowd and i said nana i got her up i got her up and my nana was like what did you do and i just said i called the great physician on the scene so i just want to thank the lord for my horse's health because she means a lot to me any other youth young sisters our young brother brother adame is my dog jordan is a pimple jordan is some people um she keeps on escaping and and we have sometimes we have a hard time finding her escaping problems just figured out to open doors this last time she escaped our neighbors had we it was on my birthday i believe we were at the pastor's cabin and we found out that our diet had escaped oh luckily our neighbors had had potter and kept her in in their house i just want to thank the lord for that miracle gracious amen we have a couple more specials tonight we have a brother julian hill especially julian hill um sister elizabeth gallegos elizabeth gallegos and sister rebecca rodriguez rebecca rodriguez god bless you hello everyone god bless you um so sadly i wanted to do this in person but i got i got a some information about a family emergency that i had to hightail it to so unfortunately i can't be there tonight but i can still give you this in digital form thanks to the evolution of technology so that's what i'm doing i'm here to uh to give you this poem that i wrote about a year ago for you all to enjoy and so yeah not a song or anything like that but a poem and so um before i do i kind of wanted to talk a little bit just for a moment about what it means to me and and how these poems were inspired and how god worked through them and and how i hope they can bless you as well um because that seems to be very interesting how god works and i hope we can all agree but uh yeah so about a year ago i started to go through some some pretty intense uh things i started to really um deal with myself as a person and as a character and uh and what um what i am and what my relationship with god was and i really started to to really go through it and uh really start addressing some of the things that i was that i was just ignoring and putting off for such a long time and um unfortunately uh i don't process that well i don't process things healthily all the time but that's okay because just as soon as i started to process it unhealthily like i had every time before god finally showed up and said i got something better let's make poetry and so um i was sitting in church one day and uh and i got the inspiration and i was like poetry i don't i don't do poetry that's that's lame and he was like nope we're doing poetry and so uh i was given the inspiration for 140 poems broken up into um seven uh no yes seven books of 20 poems and you're not going to get all 140 tonight but i am going to publish all of them in a book very soon but i won't say when but you're going to get one of them and it's titled ix which is uh nine in roman numerals and that's it that's all the title it is it was the ninth it was the ninth poem i ever wrote about a year ago and so these poems are really special to me because uh they allowed me to process a lot of what i was going through and uh they allowed me to get some one-on-one time with god uh in ways that i had never done before and i was never able to it was just a really intimate and personal experience that really helped me process what i was going through a lot and i'm sure that they'll help other folks process that as well that's the whole point of these is just doing the works for for the other for everybody else but uh it was survival for me so i i i pray that it's survival for you too if uh if that's what it if that's what it does for you but either way these gifts are for you all so without further ado i'd like to read ix which was the ninth poem that i wrote about a year ago the thoughts of the devil while against me but i will not crumble for my lord god stands he is almighty he makes the devil tremble though my battle rages on each day i fear no loss and in the midst of evil i'll say the blood of jesus is on the cross come all evil come all hell you are known to come anyway but i have word from god to tell he is alive each and every day the battle is long but i don't mind though you pick the brain with delight victory simple get thee behind a wrongdoing devil you've lost in every right how is it to be destined to fail is that why you are so driven know that though you nash and wail the truth remains he is risen it is not easy to win this war each battle a soul to claim but my god knows who he's fighting for and i fight for him the same you may come with all you've got the damage you will do but know this battle is not for naught for the lord will always ring true god bless you all [Music] without him i could do nothing without him i surely like a ship without a sail jesus oh jesus do you know when today do not turn him [Music] would be [Music] without him i would be dying [Music] but with jesus thank god i'm safe [Music] jesus oh jesus do you know when today do not turn him away jesus so jesus without him [Music] i would be [Applause] [Music] i'm going through so many changes [Music] what's the news somebody's hurt somebody's thinking somebody's trying to find a [Applause] [Music] a troubled [Music] [Music] everything [Music] [Music] is [Music] is jesus rescues me searching for someone jesus [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] and everywhere [Music]

[Music] [Music] testimony and um the funny thing is that when i love myself i started to laugh and um i was i thought to myself the reason that god didn't show me anything made me laugh in the face of the devil [Music] and that's our god bless you [Applause] was talking a lot back there about giving thanks to the lord i'm next yeah okay god bless you just later so i think it was like a few weeks ago my sister from my dad's size she was i guess crying a lot establiondo mucho and she my grandma had given her a can and it was like a can of vegetables or something and i guess she had it and she was running and she dropped it on her foot and her toes like all bruised and it was bleeding a lot [Music] more but at the time i was in thera's at my mom's house when it happened so my grandma texted me what happened and stuff look at how at that moment i kind of just like inside myself and that's the moment i kind of just said you know lord let your will be done so i think it was like maybe an hour later he is and she was telling me that that nothing was broken and that she was fine and all they did was they just put a band-aid on it and she was just running in and out of it so i just want to thank god for keeping her safe amen amen all hail king jesus all hailed king [Music] worship him just jesus a little bit raise your hands to him just sing to him from your heart he's loving with
