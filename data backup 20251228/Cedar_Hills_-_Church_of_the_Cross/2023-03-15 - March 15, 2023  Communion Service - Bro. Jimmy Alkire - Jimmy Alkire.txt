surrendered his life he gave it all for you and me you're so kind let's open our Bibles to the 14th chapter of Genesis starting with verse 14. amen foreign and we're going to entitle this Abraham's Faithful Men amen and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his house 318 and pursued them until then and he divided himself against them and he and his servants by right and smote them and pursued them to Oba which is on the left a hand of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and brought again his brother-in-law and his goods and the women also and the people [Music] and the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of lomer and the kings that were with him at the valley of Shaving which is the King's Dale when the world and Melchizedek of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and blessed him and said Blessed Be Abraham of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth is and blessed be the most high God whom which have delivered thine enemies into thy hand and he gave him ties of all Amigos and let us pray we just thank you Lord for this portion of your word Lord and we see faithful Abram Abram here we know our Prophet when he speaks of this he he calls it him Abraham yes when his name was already changed when here his name was Abram but the prophet was seeing the final product of what Abraham we thank you now Lord Jesus for your words in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen you may be seated and uh if you could go ahead and give me that first quote up there I'll read it here you'll have it up on yeah they've got it up here we are in a battle now how many believe we are in a battle we're after our fallen brother how many are after your Fallen Brothers how many when you see a brother or sister struggling and maybe they seem like they're lagging behind us yeah your heart goes out to them you know this is the Simplicity and what the message says and this is what I have tonight because notice until Abraham he he he just he didn't need to be bad to go to battle he didn't need an invitation to go to battle as soon as he heard that his brother had been taken prisoners the children you know I believe that please the Lord so much that he decided to come down and serve communion it moved the heart of God to see his elect man Abraham didn't need a big Revelation Revelation they need to be persuaded how many of us need to be persuaded sometimes to do something for somebody or if we don't get invited we're not going to go you know estacita we're after our fallen brother that God before the foundation of the world son predestinated unto eternal life and the things that the world has got him caught up in a whirlwind and he is out in societies and classes him and his wife Elizabeth walking up and down the streets smoking drinking carousing um trying to find peace how many of you at one time were trying to find peace we don't come here tonight to find peace we come to celebrate that we have the peace that has been shed by the Holy Ghost and we're so thankful I make sure that I have my life centered on Christ but it's not my worthiness to begin with that's not your worthiness to begin with the worthiness of the spirit of God bleeding words this word is bleeding out life is can you believe tonight in this little simple thing that we're going to do we won't even have to pray for the sick and people will be healed people maybe have had a spirit follow them all their lives tries to make them think they're not a son or daughter when they know in their heart they're a son and daughter and as we as particular Jesus paragraph 69. and when the battle is finally ended we'll meet Mel kiss the dick again how many believe that we know that Melchizedek later on became Jesus Christ but we're not up here to teach tonight to stimulate your faith that when this battle is finally over when is bless God blessed Abraham and gave him a blessing and he give him Bread and Wine the communion when the battle is over we'll meet him my my I love the way the Bible in English says and he brought forth I believe personally he just created it don't ask Abraham foreign right brought forth simply produce praise the Lord Jesus Christ we just love him so much you know we're about to take a trip to Africa Africa and I think it's just the inspiration of the Holy Ghost leading our pastors and what are we going after okay to try to have more than somebody else we're after our fallen brother and as we do what God leads us to do so please our creator okay when the battle's over we come back come back with all the goods with all the women we come back with all the churches and maybe God will just be so beautiful and he'll come down well I've got 10 minutes left maybe you may be five I want to keep it bye yes praise the Lord Jesus Christ after the battle let's turn to Luke 22 it's almost and we're going to read verses 11 through 18. amen and our time will be up here I want you to notice if Jesus was so concerned that he wanted the special place to partake of the communion with his disciples verse 11 and you shall say unto the Good Men of the house the master said unto thee where is the gas chamber amen amen go ahead they say is where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples how many believe he's going to eat the Passover with you tonight Holy Spirit fellowshipping with God through these elements and he shall show you a large upper room furnished what a coincidence that it's an upper room I don't think that's a coincidence I just think he was making something to foreshadow when the Holy Spirit you will descend in the upper room yeah I believe that and they went and found and he had said unto them and they made ready the Passover and when the hour was come he sat down and the 12 up now he calls them apostles and The Twelve Apostles with him apostolis he was declaring now that they're no longer just going to be disciples because we see the discipline and he said unto them with desire I have desired to eat the Passover with you before I suffer he has such a strong desire he wanted a special place he wanted an upper room because he has foreign go ahead and give us that last quote in our time is gone amen yeah out of the message the communion preached in 1957 81. and this thing Melchizedek said yesterday I will take no more fruit of the vine until I drink it Anew with you in my father's Kingdom after the battle is over when the victory is won then we'll take it Anew in his kingdom when the last battle is how do we not know this is going to be the last battle when that last sword has killed the last evil of the world and the great Church of the Living God triumphs Christ will meet them in the air with Bread and Wine again and take the communion and for eternity in the presence of uh will he serve it again and he's going to provide him he's not going to ask us for a better wife Lord Jesus thank you tonight for this little short thoughts we pray that you'd bless your children Lord blessed your servants God and as we partake of these holy sacraments Lord in transportation sacramentos these elements and you are the Creator Lord may it do something in our hearts first of all Lord and may we just be honest with you tonight as we come before okay Lord I want more of you every day Lord without you I am nothing Lord but your spirit lives in my heart now bless your children Lord we ask it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen amen amen God
