I greet you all in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen our God is good amen hallelujah amen let's turn to our Bibles this morning welcome you all in the house of the Lord amen welcome our visitors [Music] back the chtis and the place amen praise the Lord let's turn to our Bibles Luke chapter 1: 26 going to speak amen just to give a little title the Holy Ghost seed in the bride amen the Holy Ghost seed that's what's needed amen amen praise the Lord Luke chapter 1 amen we'll read from verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a virgin espouse to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail is this thing on maybe take this people off yeah feed back amen and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus and he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of Goden behold th cousin Elizabeth she had also conceived a son in her old age this is a six month with her which is called Baron for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said behold the ID of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel departed from her amen may be seated the Lord had blessings the reading of his word amen go to Galatians Chapter 5 Verse 22 amen Galatians 5:22 says but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentle goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law amen praise the Lord amen now we would know that when we talk about a fruit fruit doesn't just come about there must be a seed amen so if there's a fruit of the spirit there must be seed of the spirit amen hallelujah amen and that's what we are focusing on has the seed of the spirit been swn into our souls amen so we have lots of privileges being in the message of the hour we as the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ are living Amen in our Privileges and to live beneath our privileges is to not embrace the truths that has been revealed to us under the message of the amen through the prophetic gift of William Mary and brandom am amen he was the Elijah Prophet spoken of in Malachi 4:5 and 6 to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers he was also the seven Church age messenger sent to the lestans in Revelation 3:14 amen and he was the seventh angel in Revelation 10:7 who was to sound a trumpet message revealing the mysteries of God now one would ask what was the mysteries of God very Brandon will sum it up in this NE in this quote he says now watch in the seven Church age when the seventh angel begins to sound the mysteries of God was to be made known right there and he says the seals so the mysteries of God is in the seals it's contained in the seals amen hallelujah and he goes to the next one and he says we're going to use like a little Sunday school lesson now it's not directed to anything any certain persons just to the church the body of Christ that we're trying to lead to deeper thoughts and higher objectives amen so that's what the message of the hour came to do to lead us to deeper thoughts and higher objectives amen if we take amen just Mary herself here and we're looking at her life the angel came to lead her to higher thoughts amen deeper thoughts and higher objectives notice the mind of Christ was not withheld from me amen he told her everything that was going to happen and there was a dialogue happening between the angel and Mary the same way there's got to be a dialogue between the Angel and the Bride of Jesus Christ now there has to be a connection with the supernatural amen hallelujah he has come to lead us into deeper thoughts and higher objectives amen notice we read in Luke chapter 1 amen the angel coming to Mary also reveals to her about the Forerunner yes sir which church in the end time which Bride of the last days as knowledge of the Forerunner amen amen he not only reveals to you he's going to overshadow you and you are going to bring forth the Life of Christ but he's also told you about the Forerunner amen didn't the angel tell Mary your cousin Elizabeth is going to bring forth the Forerunner yes oh yes so nothing is with from this bride therefore the bride of Christ can see the messenger of the last days amen so to not allow the message of the hour to have its full effect in our life is to live beneath our privilege we can hear about the message of the hour we can sympathize with the message of the hour but not to let it have its full effect is not to live is to live beneath our privilege to come to church out of religion is to live beneath our privilege Amen to live a dry Barren dead life without the baptism of the Holy Ghost is to live beneath our privilege amen hallelujah to live in a world act like a world act like the world Amen have Ambitions like the world flat like the world Amen is to live beneath our privileges to chase after women to chase after men Amen to chase after popularity and fame and desire of Friendship with the world is to live beneath our privileges Lord these are not things to be Amen to Rejoice about to indulge in and to be happy about but that is the bride is living under privileges when she partakes of those things amen amen to chase after money and riches in this life dedicate our time and efforts to make our life more comfortable here in the cycle of 70 years amen is to live beneath our privileges God has opened up so much more to us than to worry about a temporal benefits people focus on the stock markets people amen might spend hour by hour chasing amen cryptocurrencies and chasing amen the investment keeping an eye on those things but I'm asking you is your eyes fixed on the word for today amen are you becoming more like Christ Hallelujah we pay attention to so much more but we pay Miss paying attention to the main thing which is Christ in me the hope of glory am I allowing him to have the full effect in my life amen the prophet teaches us watch money watch women watch popularity amen hallelujah the lust of the eyes the lust of the flesh the pride of life if you see in Matthew 6:24 there our lord Jesus is telling us you can't serve God and the devil have we got the scripture let's put it up what is he saying he's saying the devil hello no one can serve two masters either will eat the one and love the other or else he will ow to the one and despise the other yes you cannot serve God and the devil yes come on now read is he saying the Devil he's saying Mammon Mammon is not the devil what is it say it louder brother ra it's deceitful riches it's possessions and whatever is trusted in whatever you put your trust in that's Mamon deceitful riches so Jesus is telling us you can't serve God and Mammon amen neither can you serve God and and Elevate woman to a place of Godlike status in your life amen men ought to grow a backbone don't be a Susy around your girlfriend you become like a jellyfish every every time she tells you something you jump you're a Son of God hallelujah amen hallelujah amen men are men are supposed to be raised in a family where they are taught that they are going to be the head of the home leading the home in spiritual things you can't be a jellyfish you got to have a backbone which means you got to know the word amen thank you Lord amen yes don't look at a pretty set of eyes that's what happened to Samson yes Delilah stripped him of his power and if you are not careful a woman can strip you of your power a woman can strip you off your calling the pr of God says amen that he deceived she deceived Samson by flatteries yes show me your strength show show me your power and don't think you are being loving when you revealing your secret you are striping yourself of power if you go and read uh the the message of deceived Church by the world the prophet is teaching you how the church lost its power and how to regain it he tells you the first time she tied his hands he broke those bands and he says Luther came forth breaking the B of the Catholic church amen he says the second time she tied his hands Wesley came forth and broke those bands the third time amen he says the Pentecostal church was supposed to break those bands amen but because she settled for the sides of Jordan the side the banks of Jordan because they settled for the banks of Jordan got dispossessed of power and what happened Samson lost his eyes and we know the eyes of the church is the prophet so when the prophet was taken off the scene that's the state the church is in a people without a prophetic gift in the land right so the bride was found in a lukewarm condition blind wretched miserable being led around the place and going to be M of but brother BR says thank God for a new luck of ha That Grew thank God for a new luck in the end time thank God for people are not settling for religion amen amen but want to see the Promise fulfilled in their own life praise the Lord amen amen a new lock a fresh anting amen hallelujah and he was what what did he call he called a young boy amen hallelujah he needed a fful Ministry Amen to lead him to be the eyesight in this hour praise the Lord because the prophetic gift had gone eyes were gone so he needed to be in the mind age after the eyes comes the mind so the bride has the mind of Christ she knows what he wants done with the word and Samson knew his greatest defeat amen his greatest victory was going to be right there even though he looked like amen Dark Void without form without shape that's exactly the condition Genesis 1 opens with showing you a latery and condition and that's what Zechariah 4 says amen that amen gross Darkness shall cover the Earth the people but there shall be light in the evening time amen amen light has come in the evening time and God spoke in the beginning let there be light thank you Lord amen don't accept any dark situation in your life you speak light over your situation you speak light over your circumstance we have not been called Amen to be a people without without hope without power amen we have not been called a people to be powerless this ought to be the Church of the Living God Amen where the power of God flows freely amen amen so we are saying let us not live beneath our privileges but everything that is being opened up to us let us live in the glory of that amen amen to to have a casual approach to the message of the hour is to live beneath our privileges to come to church and sit dead as a door nail is to live beneath our privileges brother BR in that same message says some people come to church they got no Victory they come inside they go outside amen they come in amen without a shout of praise and they go out without a shout of Praise amen but he says amen a Holy Ghost full person can't help but praise the Lord amen when the songs are being sung they involved in the worship amen amen when the word is being preached they amen the word of God thank you Lord yes amen hallelujah glory amen amen no praise sometimes no Hallelujah no joy no amen no fruit of the spirit now you can't get a mango without you having a mango seed so you can't tell me you got the fruit of the spirit without the seed of the spirit amen praise the Lord Lord hallelujah now like we are saying for there to be fruit there must be seed yes but we are living in a time like never before yes now you have fruit without seed right they have seedless grapes that's not the kind of fruit of spirit I want we don't want a seedless Holy Ghost amenl hallelujah amen for for there to be fruit there must be seed if there is no seed it means it's I bread praise the Lord amen seedless fruit genetically modified in a lab anything that anything ibrid cannot reproduce itself we have lots of hybrid fruits in our stores no seed in there that's a sign it was amen developed in a lab it's hybrid and there's no or very little nutritional value to it and and some people like seedless grapes oh I don't like when I'm eating I don't like to bite the seed some people love seedless grapes some people love seedless fruit and some people like boneless meat you go to a restaurant I like a deboned Roy Curry mutton Curry they don't want the bone yeah we serve bones with the meat amen you won't get boneless career am hallelujah amen amen praise the lord we like the bones amen amen we like the marrow bone some of you call it banging bone praise the Lord why amen you like the suul succulent juice of the word praise the Lord I know I'm making you hungry amen praise the Lord hallelujah but what am I trying to show you amen we can't have a seedless Holy Ghost come on church we can't be showing then then we are showing manifestations that are not that are hybrid that's why brother Brandon was against Sensations and just jumping and shouting and just emotions and all of these things because that is showing amen amen the fruits of something with no seed in there right and I'm telling you it's the only time in age where we have seedless fruit right because there science has progressed people get less dependent upon God right you watch somebody gets struck with illness the first thing they want to do is run to the doctor and they forget about Dr Jesus they forget about the power that's been released to the church the Bible says call the Elders of the church amen go read that scripture yes sir if any is sick amen among you call the doctor amen does he say that he says call the Elders of the church let them anoint you with oil let them pray over you but what we amen we we depend more on Medical Aid than Miracle Aid yes amen hallelujah thank you Lord we depend more when our finances run low we don't go to Gyra we go to some loan shark we go to some person amen we go Amen to the bank we go on overdraft we go to credit cards why Sciences increased to make life more easy for you so that you don't depend on your original Source ever oh yes ABA is source of healing ABA is source of finances ABA is source of peace amen don't run to a psychologist run to Jesus amen yes thank you Lord thank you Lord praise the Lord so God hates hybriding amen now as much as scientist tapped into God's laboratory like the prophet would tell us they also have tapped into Satan's laboratory science and progress everything is artificial and they celebrate artificial stuff yes amen that's right now they have artificial sweetness and artificial colorance and artificial this and artificial that so much so the man is now G gearing up to rely on artificial intelligence man is glorifying something that's artificial and they have failed because Satan doesn't want them to realize they were created in the image of God amen amen so he's trying to present to them something artificial man thinks they need something artificial to assist man but God sent the genuine Holy Ghost to assist man and they don't want the genuine intelligence they want an artificial intelligence right the seed of the spirit is the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah so God eates anything that's hybrid God EES hybrid religion or water down religion God hat a seedless fruit of the spirit a bunch of carrying on based on emotions amen dry out confessions and and crucifying of the spirit amen They Crucified the son when he came in the flesh yes they crucified the word when it was revealed now they're crucifying the spirit when it is sent to the church amen you say how do I crucify the Spirit by rejecting the Spirit by not allowing him access to your soul you can say but I got the Holy Ghost In My Flesh I feel good I got the holy ghost in my spirit not good enough amen the Holy Ghost wants to be a possessor of your Souljah the holy ghost is now brooding over the Earth amen looking for Sons and Daughters of God and there's a jean seed locked up within your soul that the holy ghost is now hunting and searching for amen thank you Lord but people don't want the Holy Ghost amen they crucify the holy ghost by rejecting the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost was sent to give Sons and Daughters amen a new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost but people don't want the Holy Ghost they want to settle for good morals a set of morals in the message values of the message they want morals of the message they want but you can impersonate this message you can impersonate being a message believer you can have all the outward motions and manifestations of a message believer but unless that se Gene of God that has been quickened by the Holy Ghost you will never have a resurrection amen right because the Bible says if the Same Spirit now now now this is a sobering thought the spirit that lived in Jesus yes is the Holy Ghost the Bible says if that same Spirit yes that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you you know we'll place value brother Jeff if I gave you maybe your great great great great grandfather's guitar wouldn't you value it now think about great great great great maybe there will be a 19 something Fender or something what value will you place on there hey yes it's vintage it's Priceless amen you wouldn't want to sell it it's now in your family now I want you to really get this The Same Spirit that lived in Jesus yes sir that raised up jesusall is dwelling in The Believer Same Spirit that anointed him on the Jordan amen he coming upon the believer Same Spirit not another spirit amen oh what Eternal value that is yes amen praise the Lord amen so we don't want to settle for a good moral life amen if the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you it will also Quicken your mortal body so what happened to Jesus will happen to you amen the Holy Spirit quickened Jesus mortal body it will also Quicken your mortal body amen amen thank you Lord you what the prophet of God is saying now in the church age book resume of the church ages he says this age started just after the turn of the 20th century as it was to be the age in which the true church would return now get this it's supposed to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at Pentecost amen yes we know that there must of necessity be a return of dynamic power hallelujah thank you Lord we are not hoping for that we are not wishing for that brother Bram uses the word must there must be a return of dynamic power Hallelujah the Believers sensed this in their spirits and began crying to God for a new outpouring such as was in the first century what seemed to be the answer came as many began to speak in tongues right and manifest gifts of the Spirit you see that's what I'm talking about living on the banks of Jordan they came across Jordan but when you cross any River you must come to the bank of a river come on somebody and living on the banks of Jordan they started to speak in tongues and they settled on the sides of on the banks of Jordan but we don't want to settle on the banks of Jordan we want to go into the land and possess the land amen we want to possess all that rightfully belongs to ours am and God is releasing it to the church little by little because the land is is full of inhabitants and that's why you find going into a higher dimensions of the Holy Ghost the Lord is releasing it to us little by little amen thank you Lord praise the Lord he says amen so don't live on the banks of Jordan don't be happy that you just crossed over Jordan and don't just dwell on the banks of Jordan it was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited restoration it was not for the latter rain came can only come after the former rain very important now the latter rain can come after the former rain which is the spring or teaching rain the latter rain then is the Harvest rain how could this be the real when the teaching rain had not come the prophet messenger who was to be sent to teach the people and turn the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers had not yet come thus what was thought to be the restoration and final quickening unto the Rapture had not come in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost now what your brother Brandon brings up you would think that partaking of the spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost is a good thing but he is saying the unrighteous partaking of it right in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it also was the devil power as men were under control of devils now he's not talking about uh other religions yet he's talking about the church under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it I I tell you some church is under the control of demon powers yeah in the message right but we recognize it amen then to prove that it was not real these people even before a second generation that appeared organized wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every other group ahead of them that sounds so familiar to me people build fences wrote their own doctrines sent it out organized it amen you get two Jesus doctrines amen you get polygamy doctrines amen you get people that just go off on one tangent of the word praise the Lord now I'm getting to a point here now to show you that the teaching alone is not the only thing required so the prophet had to come with the teaching we just established that now right the early Pentecostals thought they had it but they had to wait for Malachi 4:5 and 6 they had to wait for Revelation 10:7 that's what the court just established now we want to see something here he says preaching usually catches The Sinner brings him under condemnation by the word but teaching places the man positionally what he is am and we can never rightly be able to have faith until positionally we know what we are now for a long time we've been rejoicing under the teaching Reign teaching of the word is the mechanics follow me now am teaching of the word is the mechanics it places you positionally to know that you are a son and daughter of God it teaches us the promises of our age and what we are supposed to be but it is not supposed to just remain a teaching oh yes some of you going to University you are getting the teaching of what's required for you to become that that profession but the teaching is not good enough we have the best of teachers in the message of the hour God ordained gifts we love and appreciate these men of God but we can't stay at teaching Al once you know who you are what you are called for once you graduate there's got to be a spark of Life come over that teaching to make it live the dynamic power coming to the word to make it live and bring you to a fully adopted son being a coworker with the Holy Spirit and taking care of father's business stop showing everyone your ring M stop showing everyone your rope stop telling everyone how the father kissed you and take care of father's business am hallelujah amen stop telling everyone who you are who you are going around telling everyone when the bride recognizes who she is how about you start to live in who you [Music] are amen teaching can only take you so far right amen hallelujah it's time to take control of Father's Kingdom the father did not send the tutor the Holy Spirit to you for nothing the father was a responsible father he didn't send the tutu to you for nothing the tut is the holy spirit amen he knew what you needed to come to full position amen so that you can handle father's business now I got good news for you you didn't come and be born again and saved to escape the Earth Lord as soon as I become a Christian Lord take me away no Our Father who are in heaven Hallowed Be Your Name Your Kingdom come thank you Lord bring your kingdom on Earth let God wants you to manifest his kingdom life on the earth amen that's why he sent the Holy Ghost you looking to run away from the earth you're looking to run away from respons abilities that's been placed in your hands amen somebody who can handle father's business so he send the spirit of his sons the tutor the guide to you his son and daughter to mold you into his image and likeness and he placed you under his syllabus the conduct order and doctrine of the message of the hour amen now I'm going to back up what I'm saying in uh in the next quote seven Church ages he says and in preaching now there is some people that are preachers they can pick up the word with inspiration and swayed out there in places that's watering the seeds that the teacher has taught so we've had the teaching ring we've had great teachers in the message establish the truths positionally place the people where they are but what we need is preachers of the Holy Spirit that can pick up the spirit amen and water the seeds that's been taught amen I if you're getting it that's watering the seeds that the teacher has taught see you've got to put some seed in first then water it oh I just love the teaching of the word some people are ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth yes amen yes they are leading the people in a de walk in a Wilderness renowned names men who who claim to be eight angels are leading people down dead traps yeah the Bible says no man knowe the day or the hour but these men are so bold to put dates to things and even go to statements like the Holy Ghost has left the Earth then they come around now realizing that it's not so because they missed the date they come around the Lord delayed he's coming let me tell you something that scripture alone condemns them because the Lord is saying a wicked and adulterous person will say the Lord delayed is coming right Jesus said that that it's a wicked person that will say the Lord delayed he coming go read your Bible yes in the context of that of that of that line the Lord delayed it's coming Jesus is saying it's a it's a wicked person that will say the Lord delayed he coming now because they said the Holy Ghost left the Earth they're saying now the Lord delayed is coming Lord delayed nothing you must located the word you dislocated the word hallelujah amen why yeah still trying to teach the people they can't keep the People by the word so they go keep presenting new things new things now I'm hearing amen the latest one they're saying we are going to stop the holy ghost from going over to the Jews we are keeping the Holy Ghost what nonsense you can't stop nothing that's right why to cover up a false teaching we will stop the holy ghost from crossing over to the Jews we keeping the Holy Ghost the Lord helped people and the Lord help us not to get caught up that's right right so let's follow now you got to put some seed in first then water it and the watering comes from the preaching of the word so watch that Spirit now that's coming people are saying we just need the opening of the word we just need the teaching of the word we just need to be taught more what is brother gram saying you need to water what you being taught yes how long you going to be in school how long are you going to be in University how long a normal degree is four years after that you must leave the university some people fail purposely so they can stay another year then some go on to be become academics some go on for their honors some go on for their doctorates I don't know what's uh then I don't know these things maybe PhD they keep studying and studying and studying they never work then they themselves who never went say they were studying to become a engineer not one day in their life did they go and fix anything or do anything but now they become the lecturer in the University why they got the PHD hey they got this thing now they teaching all the other people how to do things but they never fixed an engine in their life amen amen we have Brilliant Minds in the message telling you about the third pole and how it operates and how they disregard the first and second pole and telling you about the the teaching of the word but they never prayed for one person that person got healed that's right so to hide the power of God not moving through them they condemn everybody else where the spirit of God is moving yeah you'll find the spirits you'll hear them making comments amen praise the Lord amen so we've got to uh do we finish see let's see now there's a great vast difference between a teacher and a preacher right right see it's two different gifts of the Spirit all together two different gifts amen and H say say this the prophet really I haven't a gift of either so he is telling you there's a different gift between a teacher and a preacher I say the Lord raise up preachers amen amen amen so we have got to appreciate and realize what we have in the form of the opening of the word we know that the teaching is vitally important to place a Believer positionally to know who we are to take away Amnesia to restore the bride back to condition a church operating under the power of the Holy Ghost now we know that God started the church the way he wanted it now God wants the church the way he started it amen amen praise the Lord and the church we know started on the day of Pentecost full of power the disciples have been walking with the word for 3 and 1 half years Hallelujah they which means they had the teaching of the word but the word was crucified and resurrected for a purpose Christ wanted to have the preeminence in those disciples amen not just to be with them but to be in them Glory yes so he went back amen he went back Amen to heaven and he sent back his Spirit on the day of Pentecost now if you read I don't have time to read it now for multiple reasons amen I know you're uncomfortable with the weather but if you read Acts chapter 2 there was no ordinary event amen praise the Lord but now we find amen that this was a promise of the scripture Joel had prophesied about it so which means this was a fulfillment of scripture Hallelujah the spirit of God was coming to dwell in The Souls of men amen amen that was God's original design and purpose for man that God would send his spirit that would live in man now how many of you know Redemption is not bringing something new come on walk with me or close now Redemption is not to bring something new so the coming of the Holy Spirit was not something new amen Redemption means to bring you back to your original condition am which means man's original Spirit was the Holy Spirit man's original Spirit was the Holy Ghost In The Garden of heeden God was not presenting something new on the day of Pentecost to redeem means to bring you back to your original condition so now we know why hadam was able to operate and speak to mountains and speak to the winds and speak to the waves and speak amen things because the original Spirit the holy spirit tabernacled in Adam amen amen thank you I'm saying it again the holy ghost coming on the day of Pentecost was not something new added to Redemption yes because the very word Redemption means to bring you back to your original condition from what you fell Allelujah thank you Lord so that's why I'm saying it was no ordinary event that was original Spirit coming back to the church praise the Lord that was a promise of scripture that's what Joel prophesied about amen this was God's original design and purpose for man amen so that the spirit could live in man Redemption is not doing something new amen but to bring it back to its original condition its original position am praise the Lord thank you Lord the prophet of God says but now what about the true seed the people of God are being made ready by the word of truth from the messenger to this age inner will be the fullness of Pentecost for the spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning and he says that is thus say the Lord so he's just confirming the holy spirit is going to bring you to original condition you were back at the beginning hallelujah amen he says it's thus say the Lord that's what Joel 223 to 26 says and then he starts to read it right amen talking about the former Reign the latter rign and he's talking about the wheat and the fat shall overflow with oil and wine we've been through that and I will restore to you the years that the Locust had eaten now just pay attention brother Bram said the latter rain is the hour [Music] rain amen he said the former rain is the teaching rain the latter rain is typing the Dynamics coming to the church the hours rain amen I'm saying that for a reason because we're going to go very quickly and amen so he's restoring through all that the Locust canor C and palmor has eaten now now it says God is going to restore the Lutheran Church age did not restore the church it started a Reformation the wesan church did not restore Pentecostal age do not restore but God has to restore for he cannot deny his word amen this is not the resurrection of the church it's a restoration God will take the church right back to Pentecost of the beginning notice in the ver verse 25 it tells us why we need a restoration the Locust cankerworm caterpillar palor and eaten all by the root and a small bit of the stem now we are told that all of these insects are all one and the same in different stages that's obviously typing your hor Riders it's one but in different stages they are the Antichrist spirit manifested in organization denomination and false Doctrine Through the Ages and that poor little root and stock is going to be restored God isn't going to plant a new church but he's going to bring its original planting back to original seed amen he's doing it as he stated in verse 23 what verse by the teaching of former rain now watch I said the AVS rain is the Dynamics I said the AVST rain is amen hallelujah the the Dynamics coming to the teaching he now says the hour rain or rapturing faith so we see it's right in line with the word that we need the preaching of the word to bring the Dynamics of the spirit to the church amen hallelujah thank the hour that we're living we going to close now amen praise the Lord we're almost done the ecclesiastical of spirits uniting together now and bringing them all under one big Slaughter to blot out it's already in writing here in this nation now that these churches has to be closed unless you with the organization it's a union a boycott just like the mark of the beast right and now you see what the Beast is don't you it's a power and a power ecclesiastical power Jesus said it'll be so close it'll deceive the very elect if it was possible but he promised to have something here for us in that day that we wouldn't be deceived and that's the word Christ to make it manifest to us now watch what he says they Supernatural Devils unseen to the eye amen so they are Supernatural de Devils at work unseen to the eye but you can see what they're doing am notice while the group is riding making themselves ready to stomp out everything that won't agree with them there's another group being made ready are you one of them amen hallelujah after a while amen Revelation 19 the next time the church is heard she comes not upon her exactly horses the Bible says he was on a white horse and the host of heaven was following him upon white horses while this group down here has got 2,000 bound at the river Euphrates there has been bound for 2,000 years also that church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years now can you believe that that man Jesus said whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven but man also possesses the ability to bind the Holy Spirit are you reading what I'm reading amen they bound the Holy Ghost [Music] he says that church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years right under marm back there under the church ages it's been bound not at the river e frees but at the door of Creeds and dogmas oh the Lord help us not to bind the Holy Spirit oh yes he says that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of man made systems but she is going to be liberated she is coming back that's what the Bible says and those two meet one another on the Battlegrounds Lucifer and Michael again like in the beginning they've been bound for 2,000 years almost 2,000 years amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen last quote now let me say something this uniting time to see churches uniting Nations uniting it's uniting time of God and his bride I want to say this with reverence and respect I believe that the bride of Christ is called I believe she's sealed in the kingdom of God I believe the mechanics is there so the former Reign is there they're waiting for the Dynamics that will take off the Earth Hallelujah but how are the Dynamics coming the prophet is through preaching of the word thank you Lord there's a faith under the teaching of the word but under the preaching of the word the Dynamics are coming to the church for rapturing Faith the hours rain praise the Lord he says they're waiting for the Dynamics that will take off the earth into Glory into the Rapture I believer with all my heart we don't know how he's going to do it but he shall do it he is the Dynamics we just become members of the machine of his body forming out into his image and see him uniting himself with us in his works with his love gifts as he ends them to us just before the wedding supper so there's got to be some love gifts being poured out before the wedding supper thank you Lord and we are waiting watching for that their big church is to be United he says the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit that we work in a small measure while The Headstone or the teaching is coming down to unite with the body amen thank you Lord amen the Dynamics of the church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit the first filling was the former Reign the first filling was the teaching rain all the Myster is being revealed in the seals but there is a refilling amen under the dynamic power of the Holy Ghost this church must return to Dynamic power amen we can't stop the Holy Ghost move amen we must allow the Holy Ghost to flow freely in our lives stop living beneath our privileges amen allow the message of the hour to have its full effect upon us yes amen amen do you know that sometimes we are stifling the Holy Ghost by no surrender that's right we are binding the Holy Ghost by no surrender yes sir we are binding the Holy Ghost by just being involved in the Carnel in the fleshly things of life I ask you what have you done for the Lord this year don't tell me you came to church you have been called as the Apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ amen what have you done for the Lord Lord can we track your journey for 2024 come on I'm talking to every one of you what have you done for the kingdom of God amen amen [Music] amen hallelujah now remember God will dispossess you of any gifting you have if you are an unfruitful servant the one that was given talents God didn't go I give you appreciation award I'll give you a participation award you hit it in the ground that was some effort you did there diing there's no participation award God wants a return am uh Jesus wants to return what did he do he took it away he took it away from him and he gave it to the one who invested what have you invested into the kingdom of God come on I'm challenging you amen God didn't call you come and warm a PE here yes sir we come here to hear the teaching of the word the preaching of the word to be equipped but when we go out there yes what are we doing with this word thank you Lord I challenge you as we come to the end of this year set Higher Goals for your life thank you Lord set High Ambitions not chasing a cow or a house I'm not talking about that I'm talking about your spiritual growth hallelujah amen I want you to live in a seven bedroom house in the Holy Ghost am thank you Lord amen seven bedroom house in the Holy Ghost amen amen I want you to have transport that's Supernatural I'm saying set Higher Goals for our lives Glory we tracking our spiritual growth the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the holy spirit amen he says while The Headstone was coming down he says but when the head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost will raise her up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take its flights to the sky the Dynamics is the holy spirit amen and I'm saying again thank you Lord you can't have fruit of the spirit without the seed of the spirit you see there were some people who came there manifesting the fruit of the spirit they cast out Devils they prophesied in the name yes Jesus said to them depart from me you workers of iniquity you had no seed of the spirit in you I never knew you that word knew is the same word like Adam knew his wife that's right amen I never knew you means I never imparted my seed in you amen so I am challenging you maybe you thinking you here on holiday maybe you on leave now maybe your guys from school on leave you think I'm going to chill it's December time now brother said everyone wants to chill now you brought me in this hot place and you bring you a hot word to we don't know what the Lord's going to do that's right amen the next thing we could be doing a funeral but are you making wise Investments regarding your soul young men brothers and sisters if you are making any decisions make it knowing you are following the will of God Amen following the will of God don't just go and follow into any relationship don't just go and amen just do things at random without consulting the Lord you know suddenly people can hear from the Lord they backsliding is anything suddenly the Lord's hope to them you know and the brother so faithful that brother stays in prayer meetings and he stays in there the Lord never spoke to him audibly but they come the Lord told me only to find 6 months later the Lord never told them anything they use it as an excuse amen the Lord told them if you want to know something you speak to your pastor if he says every other thing you can't live higher than your pastor and you can't do this and you can't do that if you want someone to pray for you and you want a double confirmation speak to your pastor amen and tell him this is what I'd like to do I want you to pray with me and let's get an answer together when you get an answer together the pastor can't tell you don't do this and you say the Lord told me to do this and something is wrong did the Bible say in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let everything be established so how come you just want to make your own decision so which means what you're doing is not biblical amen but in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established amen even the word from the Lord let it be established you know even a prophet's word had to be brought before yes to be tested so if a prophet's word had to be brought before what's our words amen so the Lord bless you keep you let's Stand Together amen worth be praed
