shall see the supernatural in a greater measure amen hallelujah and it's not going to be with the majority it's going to be with a minority who believes it amen you'll find when we're moving in a time and season like this it's not going to be the masses of people in the messy churches God never used the masses he used a minority that were desperate and crying out for him any Revival that started it was with a minority group that were so hungry for God so hungry for his presence amen that nothing else mattered amen and I believe we have brothers we have sisters in this assembly amen who are hungering a thirsting after him Give Me Jesus or give me nothing amen give me his presence or give me nothing amen let me ask you something when when Jesus told the disciples to tarry in the city of Jerusalem what did he tell them to go teary therefore amen yes until you endured what so leave all whatever happened now with the hype they saw these men stumbling out there but you know what all of them came out there with the power amen oh yeah hallelujah amen amen they were saying hey these guys are stumbling around like drunk men but Jesus told him until you endured with power if you only saw that 120 there they went to set the city Ablaze yes right Peter's one sermon converted three thousand that day what do you think if the book of Acts followed each of those 120 and see what they did the Bible says that the book cannot contain the Miracles that were done yes yes amen now if you look in the book of Acts it follows a few of the Apostles and their Journeys can you imagine what the church was doing yeah now we are here he says Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts amen amen so we can invite our brother to come this evening and share the word of the Lord amen amen you're looking forward to a blessing amen praise the Lord amen thank you Jesus thank you amen I'll teach you all in the wonderful and precious name amen Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen to the Lord tonight amen I can sense the atmosphere then he's charged up tonight amen amen hallelujah spoke about the power amen and tonight we're going to speak about Atomic power amen the Holy Ghost is atomic power amen amen let's open amen with a scripture reading then you can take your seats amen Hebrews chapter 11 verse 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen yes for by it the elders obtained a good reports yes amen and by it we can also obtain a good report amen through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen we're not we're not made of things which do appear amen let's say that again so that things which are seen were not made of things which do okay amen amen just two more scriptures second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 1 for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens amen you believe that yes we're waiting for the body change amen we believe in this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we already have one waiting yes amen The Book of Ecclesiastes chapter 12 verse 13. now all has been hurt here is the conclusion of the matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the duty of all mankind yes amen may God add His blessings to the reading of the word you may take your seats amen amen hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen amen it's good to come to a place where we can draw strength amen amen we're Believers of like Precious Faith Hallelujah man we can charge off one another yeah we can sharpen off one another amen so it's good to be in a Charged Up atmosphere yes amen because when we're in a place where there's confusion God cannot move amen when everyone is in one Accord and in one mind like they were in the upper room then the Holy Ghost can come down on your floor amen and in one mind and it's not our mind but the mind of Christ amen because if it was just a man's intellect amen each one of us have different ideas different theories but when the mind of Christ comes down it's Supreme intelligence amen so I'd like to thank our pasta for the opportunity once again uh to exalt the word of God I tried to escape today because I knew that I'll build a Nicholson will be here and I told our pastor you know if our brother Nicholson is here you can have my slots but unfortunately I couldn't escape okay today but nonetheless I know that the Lord wants to speak tonight amen we know that amen us ministers we are just here as mute vessels amen amen but you can draw on the gift you can put on the gift amen yeah so I am just here and you can turn the steering wheel whichever way you want to go amen so you put on the gift tonight amen and let's see how the Lord can bless us amen so for a topic tonight I want to speak on spiritual astronauts amen and for a subject I want to speak on serving God's purpose amen amen are we spiritual astronauts yeah amen that we all heard and listen to the message the countdown amen and the influence of this message is drawn from that message amen so the prophet Likens us unto spiritual astronauts yes amen amen the prophet says if everything serves God's purpose it's got a resurrection yes amen but it can only rise if it serves God's purpose if a flower lives and is not dramatized it will not rise again if you plant corn and it is not dramatized it will not rise again anything that does not serve God's purpose has no Resurrection yes but you can't keep anything in the ground that serves God's purpose amen I'm just grateful for that amen amen well even for those that have gone on you cannot keep them in the ground if you have served God's purpose amen it comes forth again to testify of a resurrection amen and the prophet goes on to say we know that all these things are right yes amen hallelujah amen so if this is so then we must find out what is God's purpose amen amen because if we don't serve this purpose we have no Resurrection amen so that is not what is our purpose but what is God's purpose in this hour what is God's purpose for our lives individually yes what is God's purpose for the church as a whole the body of Christ amen and we when we find this out when we find out what's God's purpose we best make sure that we serve this purpose because the prophet is saying without serving God's purpose there is no Resurrection amen which means there is no body change yes there's no resurrection of the Dead in Christ amen now that that in itself ought to sit in Us in urgency tonight amen a deep motivation to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling amen there are to put us in motion to find out what is God's purpose amen and are we serving God's purpose it now notice you can identify what is God's purpose yet still not serve God's purpose yeah amen you can identify God working in a certain place or to a certain man or Ministry or in a certain age but you can still not serve God's purpose amen so it's two different things you can recognize the message of your day amen you can recognize amen all these things that God sent a prophet and that God had intended to send a message but you can still only sympathize with the message yes amen you can still be not serving God's purpose yeah amen and many of the times we find ourselves that we are too busy serving our own purpose amen and now Satan is cunning like that because Satan is very smart and intellectual and he has us now in the most deceptive age amen so he's the way he's created Satan's Eden is to keep us so occupied Amen to keep us so busy yes serving thinking we're serving God's purpose but we're actually serving our own purpose amen amen he keeps us so busy with work he keeps us so busy in an age where you gotta have more of everything amen now the Bible says that amen contentment is godliness amen if we are content but in this age people cannot be content amen it's always about achieving more and wanting more yes and Satan has Us in this truck amen we we go to work and we say we need to fend for our families we need to amen fend for having our food having our shelter but then as you start to get more and more money Satan starts to bring the pride of life Satan starts to influence you yeah you want bigger and better things amen maybe you got a a decent house but now you want a bigger house yeah maybe you have a decent car but now you want a bigger car yeah and to do that you put yourself in more debt and when you put yourself in more depth you have to work more longer hours amen amen so Satan has Us in the strap amen why so that we can avoid serving God's purpose because they didn't know that if we do not serve God's purpose there is no Resurrection for us amen amen amen hallelujah but we thank God Amen that God is here to Deliver Us from those things amen God is here to shed light on those things amen so let me cannot fall prey to the enemies traps amen now we see that perhaps many are in this condition in the message even they've recognized their day and their message but perhaps they are not serving God's purpose when I say God's purpose what is God doing now amen not what God did back then yes but what is God doing now amen amen are they part of that purpose yes amen and we're going to find out what that purpose is tonight amen you see our jobs and and this world does not promote God's purpose amen school does not promote God's purpose that's right amen the university is the intellectual world does not promote God's purpose that is just there to help us get by but we gotta realize when we are over emphasizing on those things yes amen amen because when we realize it then we can start to prioritize the things of God amen amen instead of being caught in that cycle we can start to prioritize what God is doing amen and just a note on that work will never stop amen the world will never stop improving amen the Bulls will never stop amen and the birds will never stop getting higher and higher amen so there's got to come a time when you gotta put a stop to it and say now I have to cry out as God amen amen it's either now or never amen so tonight I want to present to you the opportunity of serving God's purpose so we ask ourselves now that was just an introduction and we asked ourselves what is God's purpose amen the prophet says all the natural achievements that has happened in the Earth has been forerunners of spiritual achievements that God has done by his church all the Natural Things types the spiritual things amen so if we want to find out what is God's purpose now we got to see what man is trying to achieve in this hour because remember Satan is a copycat yes and Satan just like how God uses man Satan also uses man yes so if we look at what man is trying to achieve now we'll be able to see what God is trying to achieve in the spiritual world and now we find that that that's what the prophet did in the message count down the prophet took what man was trying to achieve and he typed it with the spirit amen amen you see man has been very busy he's not being idle he's always trying to achieve amen is a high achiever amen because Lucifer was a high achiever amen Lucifer wanted to achieve he wanted to be like the most high yes he wanted something more amen and man is just like that he's always trying to achieve and the prophet says the natural Man by knowledge looks backward for his achievement yes that's science see what God has done in a formal creation then go out and pick up clothes and get pieces of rocks and fossils and elements and ties them together see on that achievement they are taking what God has done and are perverting it from its original estate and making his living quarters and so forth and his economy a little better but but what has been created that's in the natural achievement but God in the spiritual achievement is going forward amen not going backwards yes he is going forward looking into the word and believing the promises of things that that has never yet come for the spiritual Revelations to manifest the spiritual things that God has promised he sees them come to pass just as the scientist in his laboratory are working on different things to help men taking creation the spiritual man is looking forward to something that God has promised amen that has never yet been created the natural man looks backward the spiritual man looks forward amen amen this is why you cannot rely on what doctors say you know and what doctors are prescribing because they are Looking Backward remember the word of God looks forward the word of God looks at the Unseen amen they can see what they've examined by way of a test and they can go back in textbooks and see what other experts have said about this condition but the word of God looks forward to the Unseen but God is an achiever looking forward amen hallelujah amen looking at the answers amen now that's that's the way they got the church amen the natural church now we're talking about the natural Church they look back to the days of funi and Knox and Calvin that was all right in their day but we are looking forward to something else the promise that's greater and higher and what God has promised science goes back to pick it up but we go forward in the word of the Lord to find out what God has achieved okay thank you amen so we can't even go backward imagine the days of the Prophet because then we will be like natural man but if we want to achieve we're going to look forward amen and look into the word of God Amen and is that not what we have been doing this yes looking into the promises of God looking into the Unseen amen what God has in store for us now if we take just for a few moments amen has the prophet spoke about amen the countdown and he takes us back to Luther's day amen and the prophet says that in Luther's day amen they started off with the horse and buggy amen this was the 16th century amen and in the 16th century it was regarded as the age of historians and the rise of the western civilization Amen in this age you had what is called the Renaissance yeah yeah for all of you who did history in schools amen amen in Italy and Europe and it saw the emergence of important artists authors and scientists and led to the foundation of important subjects which include accounting and political political science and it also led to Major Revolutions in astronomy now you see all the way back there in Luther's age they were not ready for the astronaut age but they started to have the roots of it amen the science of astronomy already started amen men started to ponder about the stars and look into the heavenlies amen we know that in Luther's day God was trying to achieve something as well and God brought about justification amen but in the beginning amen of this age the justification age amen it was not ready for the spiritual astronaut age but amen it had the Grassroots of it amen because the prophet said that the same Holy Ghost amen performs all three states amen OB justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it was at its infancy amen amen and the prophet goes on to say Amen that in this age God was trying to achieve amen he was starting to deliver the people out of Catholicism and and the Creeds of man amen and the Dogma is a man amen and the church now started now to take off amen amen they started to move no more on foot but they decided to be able to travel amen they started to go a bit more forward than one man could do previously amen now notice that amen when no doubt whenever man comes up with a new invention there's always critiques amen there's always opposition to it and this is true amen even in the days of Luther amen no doubt there would have been critics to when man wanted to travel by a horse and buggy amen there would have been opposition to it to think that maybe this IJ is crazy yeah amen and no doubt there was critics when Luther came with his message of justification yes even he seemed like a mad person amen protesting against the Catholic Church an organization that was already established yes amen and organization that was already recognized amen but this was one man protesting against the Catholic Church yes amen you see there's always opposition when man wants to achieve something in the same way there is always opposition when God is trying to achieve something amen now I want you to remember that so when we come to the end of this message because this year amen we know God is trying to achieve something amen I mean God is trying to achieve something we are going to see that there is opposition yes amen but the prophet said if man ever wants to achieve anything he's got to be perseverant amen amen hallelujah amen when George Washington amen needed to win that battle amen the prophet said he had to be perseverant yes amen he had to get on his knees and fish in the cold snow amen it didn't matter if he took the all night amen yes but he perseverance amen and that is how he got the victory amen like Noah who could preach about 120 years amen they were perseverance preaching the word of God amen amen God has persevered men throughout the Bible amen amen so in this age we've got to be perseverant amen even when there's opposition Amen to what God wants to do hallelujah amen now we see then the Wesleyan age starts to come and we know in the natural man starts to get more advanced and he starts to go into the automobile age amen and the prophet tells us that the automobile was nothing majorly different from the Austin body was still horsepower but just more power yeah amen the prophet said he just took more horsepower amen and so the Wesleyan age came with sanctification and the prophet said it was just more power amen it was the same Holy Spirit just more often amen amen the prophet said it was the same Holy Spirit doing justification but when it was time for sanctification to come those that denominated around Luther's message did not want to go on to sanctification they wanted to stay with justification but those that accepted previously his message had justification plus sanctification amen they had more power amen more of the Holy Ghost amen but it was still amen at his infancy we see in the natural in this age we only started to get the first steam automobiles Amen in its infancy and in this age began the industrial Revolution where man started to move from doing work literally with his hands and started to make Machinery to do the work for him amen amen men move from the agricultural age to creating machines amen and the church moved on to sanctification where the church started to be cleaned up amen the church started to be live Sanctified lives yes amen they started to live holy lives amen and the prophet said it's too bad that the church has lost some of that yes amen but I hope in the message amen that we can hold on to Holiness amen I hope in the message that after all this time we can still keep the standard of the message amen or sometimes when the enemy wants to creep in and take away some of those things that will restore unto us but we're going to put up our defenses amen we're going to raise the bar amen we're going to raise the standard amen and we were to uphold Holiness amen hallelujah amen and what was it more power to the church amen what was the power now it was holiness yeah there was a power to the church amen and the prophet said amen the automobile just started to multiply more power amen and sanctification just started to multiply amen more power of the Holy Ghost amen amen it was justification plus sanctification um amen then we go on Amen to the Pentecost Revival Amen in Azusa Street amen and we see in this time amen we know that the messenger of the age comes at the end of the age and at the end of the age man starts to denominate yeah amen man starts to amen want to achieve his own things and start to incorporate his own ideas because when God is not moving man is not content man wants to then take on his own yeah uh role amen man wants to take control rather than rely on the Holy Ghost amen amen Holiness the nazarenes and the church and all of these things amen they started to form their own sex but then comes the Pentecostal Revival in Azusa Street amen and in this age which is the 20th century natural man is getting into the airplane age amen we find that in the 20th century amen it was marked by new models of scientific understanding and when I see that we about you getting to load shading amen so we can to switch the mixer off amen you can just sing a song in the meantime hey man let's just sing a song Amen I'm climbing up seven steps to Perfection I'm climbing up seven steps to Perfection [Music] I am the Temple of the Holy Ghost [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] no we love you know you are the temple [Applause] [Music] I am I am the Temple of Holy Ghost amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen so we see in the 20th century amen this was marked amen sorry I just want to put this recorder back on on the mixer amen the 20th century was marked by new models of scientific understanding unprecedented scopes of Warfare new modes of communication that would operate at nearly instant speeds and new forms of Art and entertainment amen so man just started to take off the Earth amen is gone on from traveling in an automobile on the roads and he's getting starting to get a taste of the heavenlies now amen he's starting to travel by plane he's starting to travel up in the skies amen is starting to get better Communications amen at faster speeds amen his level of warfare has increased demand he's starting to have new weapons bombs and machine guns and all of these things amen and now in the same way the church has started to take off at this time amen with the Pentecost Revival in Azusa Street a man with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restoration of the gifts the church has started to throw up into the heavenlies amen they started to get a taste amen for the heavenlies amen now moving on from the mayonnaise amen from the man age of the reformers and starting to get a taste of the heavenlies amen and notice it was just more power amen so now the Jazz Saturday have justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it was more power Amen to the church amen the same power but multiply amen amen and notice man's Community communication with God has become even faster amen man started to get the gift of even speaking in tongues amen where he could speak in a Heavenly language amen amen his language now could go up into the heavenlies amen amen the church amen starts to have better Warfare amen because now they have the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen they had new weapons to attack the enemy with amen they now started to give the enemy a beating amen they had better Warfare amen just like natural men have better Warfare amen you see what man is trying to even the natural we can then see what's God's purpose in the spiritual amen hallelujah amen man who has always been on the earth he's always been Earthbound for 6 000 years now he starts to get a taste of the clouds amen he starts to get a taste of the Skies and the church amen which seems like seemed like all along it was Earthbound coming from the Dark Ages amen but now it started to flap its wings amen amen now it started to get a taste of Pentecost amen hallelujah now remember we're talking about what is God's purpose amen and to understand amen God's purpose we are looking at what man is achieving in the natural but God is trying to achieve even more amen because now we see that man starts to go into the astronaut age amen man starts to end into space for the first time yes Amen in 1961 amen 12th of April 1961 man enters the space for the first time amen amen now this is not when man went to the moon this is when man enters into inter-orbits he was still into the orbits of the earth amen and for the first time man entered into space and why why is man trying to probe into space because man has always tried to find God yeah man is always trying to find where is this God he always wants to know what is out there yes amen because remember man's concept of Heaven is still above amen they don't see it as another dimension yes amen so man starts to Trove into space amen and he entered space for the first time and orbits the earth for about 108 minutes and while a man is trying to find all these things and trying to find God and he's probing into space on the same day the 12th of April 1961 the prophet is preaching down on earth a greater than Solomon is here amen so while man is trying to find God and proving God comes down amen amen and the prophet did a greater than Solomon is here amen now we don't have to search like man for God because God works the opposite day God searches down for man amen Adam when he sinned he did not go out searching for God Amen Adam hid from God but God went searching for him amen so yeah man he's been out searching but God comes down Amen on the earth amen the prophet is preaching a greater than Solomon is here and didn't he say Amen on that day the queen of the South will rise to judge his generation amen because she traveled so far to see the wisdom of Solomon greater than Solomon was here right D in the USA was a prophet of God amen and he was not unknown he was known to everyone amen he was highly Vindicated amen right there revealing Christ but yet man wants to probe into space and try and find God amen God is so different to man amen God comes down searching for his church now notice but this was still a man in into orbit amen man had still not left the Earth's organs yet in 1961 because we know in 1961 the seals has not been opened yet yes amen the prophet was still waiting for a message at this time amen until 1963 the prophet had no message we know that yeah he was restoring all those things that we lost the water baptism and all of these things but he did not have his messages yet amen you see we can Rejoice around those things and restoration of the baptism of the whole uh in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and all of these things but that is still just into Albert Faith amen it's not Interstellar faith is yet it's still into Albert Faith amen we still just here around the earth amen but we notice amen that God wanted to achieve something more amen because man was not content just being around the Earth's orbit man wanted to achieve something more amen now what is typing in this earth amen the Earth is our bodies amen amen amen and we can't just have into all good faith amen if we want to change these bodies amen we want to travel beyond the stars amen we want to travel Beyond Dimensions amen amen you see man was still stuck in this inter orbit of the Earth amen but in 1969 man now lands on the moon now there's a lot of controversy as to whether this happened or not personally I don't believe it happened but let's take since Man Records it in history let's take man's word for it amen because the reason why I don't believe it is because the prophet said man will never land on the moon yeah so I believe a prophet amen more than science amen but if we take men's recorded history man supposedly landed on the moon in 1969. and the mission was called the Apollo 11. now I'm so many of you maybe at some stage have watched the video It's All Around YouTube now of how the spaceship is supposedly landing on the moon and if you watch the video you will see this kind of small ship landing on this huge surface of the Moon and if we look at the word Apollo 11 let's look at the meaning of the name NASA took the name Apollo from the Greek mythology Apollo as a Greek god hey man see you good this God the Greek god landing on the moon amen Apollo 11. and that was in 1969 but in 1963 God had already beat man to landing on the moon yeah amen because Here Comes The Mighty Angel descending amen not Apollo a Greek god but God himself the mighty Angel amen descending on the earth and who is the spiritual Moon amen amen God is descending upon the body amen the head is coming down descending upon the body amen amen and we know that the moon types the church amen so here comes this great head landing on the body amen amen and we know that Amen in the natural man the head is usually the smaller part in the body is just like our Apollo the small ship landed on the surface of the Moon but in 1963 God is beating man amen God has landed on the moon amen not Apollo but the King of Kings amen the Lord of lords amen the Mighty God Amen oh hallelujah it's been unveiled yes amen hallelujah one man is trying to achieve in the natural amen we can see God is achieving in the spirit amen God wants you to land on his church amen he wanted to connect with the body amen because we know Capstone had to come down amen because in Capstone doesn't come down amen the image is not perfect amen and without Capstone coming down there is no Rapture amen because love has to come down and to connect with the body amen the God is achieving this in 1963. amen aren't you grateful for that amen amen hallelujah in fact Neil Armstrong was not the first to walk on the moon because we know for 2000 years Jesus Christ has been walking in the midst of seven golden candlesticks amen the Church of Christ the moon amen reflecting the sunlight in the absence of the sun hallelujah oh man thinks he's achieving a lot amen but God is bitching him amen amen God is always ahead amen amen he did this in 1963. man goes to the moon in 1969 six years after because the number of man is like six Hallelujah amen Apollo 11. the Greek God Amen and what does 11 mean Amen in the Bible 11 represents disorder chaos and judgment amen and in 1963 when the prophet said that's our Lord up there he said the Supreme judge of all the Earth amen has come to pronounce judgment amen that's our Lord up there but is this supreme judge of all the other amen amen Supreme intelligence comes down yes amen you see Apollo 11 is only a gimmick amen because we have amen Revelations 10 which is the mighty angel coming down and how many verses are in Revelation 10. 11 verses amen so they had Apollo 11 but we had Revelation 10 coming on and 11 verses 378 messenger and to his bride amen hallelujah Give the Lord hallelujah amen the mighty Angel descend him oh Hallelujah now you might just say that I'm just making these two events foot together amen but let's see how many of you know what's the first word that was spoken by men as he was landing on the moon how many of you know now I'm not talking about when Neil Armstrong stepped out of the ship his first words were one step for man is a giant leap for

in with into all but Faith you can't do this with Earthly Faith Amen to prove that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I tell you why because Jesus Christ himself was the great spiritual astronaut amen amen hallelujah he was so full of atomic power amen and if we are to express that he is the same yesterday today and forever we're going to be full with that same power amen amen a spiritual astronaut oh my glory that makes me feel good living in this age now what a wonderful thing amen for a spiritual astronaut what did the Natural Science do amen has been able to achieve that and God through man who would stay with the Bible and say that is the same yesterday today and forever and not afraid of the promises oh not afraid amen regardless of what anybody said but stay with it amen what is it you become amen and astronaut that can go far beyond denominational thinking amen is beyond anything else it's beyond the things of the church out yonder with God and him alone Hallelujah spiritual astronauts amen amen hallelujah and you notice that an astronaut doesn't have to do anything yes he just sits there the prophet says he just sits there in this tank amen I'm just making this quote short the prophet that he just sits there in his tank and he takes a radar power and atomic power to lift him beyond space amen and then he's controlled by a tower and the prophet says that spiritual astronauts are the same amen they come into a tank amen which is the body of Christ amen hallelujah you see the Amen in the body of Christ by one Spirit we are all baptized into the body of Christ amen it's not them amen it wasn't John Glenn was a astronaut amen it was the tank that he was in yeah it was the machine he was just set there he didn't do nothing he just had real pure courage to get there amen amen have we not been saying all this big that God cannot use cowards amen amen you got to be courageous amen just sit in that spaceship amen which is the body of Christ amen and God wants man who can come into Christ and believe that he's the same yesterday today and forever amen move out into space controlled by the Holy Ghost amen that is our spiritual radar amen we are controlled by the Holy Ghost amen right astronaut when he is there he cannot dictate where he's gonna go yes amen but he's controlled by this Tower amen amen so we are controlled by the Holy Ghost amen we are not dictating which way we should go amen even if the Lord wants to stop the service right now and move in another Direction he can do so amen amen the Holy Spirit can have the preeminence hallelujah hallelujah all fights alone we try to add our own ideas and and intellect to this message we've hindered the move of the holy spirit amen amen we've hinted the move of God Amen because we want you to follow our own ways in our own thinking amen but God wants spiritual astronauts who can be just seated and reliant on the spiritual Tower the spiritual rate of the Holy Ghost amen and God can move hallelujah oh hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Lord amen I'll be grateful for Spiritual astronauts amen oh God can move in us don't be outbound church amen don't be outbound be ready to move into the heavenlies amen be ready to move past this Earth amen and we even going further than that amen we are going to switch Dimensions oh Hallelujah in the moment of a twinkling of an eye We Are Gonna Change Dimensions amen oh we have a special suit prepared for us amen a special astronaut suit amen because if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved hallelujah oh we already have one waiting yes and they that are alive amen their body shall be changed in the moment of a twinkle of an eye oh Hallelujah special suits amen amen that's able to withstand the change of Dimensions yes Hallelujah oh what a day we are living in amen amen the same power but multiplied amen Atomic power amen the prophet says what a day we are living in what a time where man is achieved amen until he's achieved himself these things amen Satan uses man's head he chooses that he chose that in the Garden of Eden yeah he takes man's head and he's thinking and he has brought that down even to the church this is why we cannot let intellectual Faith get into the church because Satan can creep in there yes amen the devil takes a man's head so he can use his eye and you'll notice if the man isn't generally Born Again spiritual he'll take what he can see with his eyes the pride of life amen so we gotta watch amen we gotta be spiritual everybody we Are Spiritual astronauts we're not going to get deceived by the enemy when he brings the pride of life amen amen because we are not Earthbound creatures amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen the Lord even the prophet is watching in the meeting you can watch when the Holy Spirit comes down in the form of a pillar of fire like he promised a man's a man is not going to be sitting there trying to reason it out with science a real believer what is he he's a radar screen watch him he begins to point around amen and he catches that one there that astronaut and he says you have cancer you have so and so amen you're from such a place the Lord Jesus Christ makes you well amen and he sails off spiritual astronauts amen oh what a church it should be amen amen hallelujah oh and you notice when an astronaut gets into space he is not defined by gravity yeah amen rapidity has no hole in him anymore amen which means that the impossible now becomes possible to him amen what is impossible to man on the earth amen when he gets up there into the heavenlies it's possible amen hallelujah oh spiritual astronauts amen man we can defy gravity amen hallelujah oh it doesn't matter amen what the circumstance is how impossible it seems amen up day in the heavenlies all things are possible to them that believe amen if thou can't believe all the things let's defy gravity now let's stand up and give God some Praise In This Place [Applause] amen let's raise our hands the prophet says when we raise our hands we are Defying Gravity Hallelujah spiritual astronauts in this place Hallelujah that can believe amen that all things are possible hallelujah oh Hallelujah church we are the best spiritual astronauts Amen brother not be Earthbound amen we gotta come to a stage where God is moving in our midst amen is trying to achieve all these things amen but God is trying to achieve more in you and I amen you are a special class of people amen God is spiritually trained you all these years amen and let me tell you something he's not changing to become lecturers amen he's changing to become practitioners amen you know many people study astronomy but they don't ever get onto a spaceship and get into space amen amen they stood here on the earth just teaching astronomy amen amen don't let us be like that in the message just teaching the message we become so intellectual in the message amen that we can teach everyone about the message but we don't get up into the heavenlies amen oh we don't sew up into a spiritual astronaut condition amen where all things are possible amen amen you can dig your seats amen don't let us be like that in the message amen we are not spiritual lecturers amen amen We Are Spiritual astronauts amen that wants to move up into the Heavenly amen amen let's go quickly hey man so man is trying to achieve all of these things amen so that was then in 1963 but science has advanced much more further now amen so now man it's time to achieve many different things many stood eventually not into space and space and trying to go into Mars and to inhabit other planets he's trying to man he's trying to change their bodies amen trying to upgrade their bodies with artificial stuff artificial limbs and all of these things we see the rise of artificial intelligence a man man is trying to create a meta verse amen if you know what a mess of us is amen I watched the video of Mark Zuckerberg and they are creating this virtual reality space amen it's like another dimension because remember man only can tap into the fourth dimension he cannot tap into the sixth dimensional the seven Dimension is influenced by The Fifth Dimension but he Taps into the front Dimension so he wants to create this virtual reality world where if you go into this virtual world you can virtually live there you can study in this virtual world I've seen the video of how they intend doing it you can be seated at your home and you put on this virtual reality device and all of a sudden you are in a lecture room even though you see the in the comfort of your room and usually you know right now the technology that we have we can video call someone and we see them on a screen but in this virtual world this person is standing next to you and you can talk to this person in real time next to you this is what man is achieving now amen and we know that this is only speaking about the Unseen World and the changing of Dimensions amen man is trying to tap into the fourth dimension but the church amen has tapped into the seven dimensions amen amen we're not artificial intelligent but Supreme intelligence has come down even we've heard this a few weeks amen Supreme intelligence has come down amen amen God is trying to achieve Amen in his church where he has a church Reliant upon Supreme intelligence amen you see that that is what God's plan is in this hour yeah amen you see that is why the prophet went beyond the curtain of time amen when man is trying to achieve this amen we have had someone who could cross over into another dimension amen and tell us about inter-dimensional travel amen hallelujah amen we are someone who could give us a positive report amen and come back with a good report amen you see so we see the rise of artificial intelligence and the invention of artificial intelligence came about to develop machines that can perform tasks without requiring human intelligence for accomplishment and the mind of Christ came down so that when Supreme intelligence is here it does not take human intelligence anymore yes but when we can get so surrendered and so full of God and so full of the mind of Christ get God can accomplish his goals through us not relying on human intelligence you see what man is trying to do with artificial intelligence God is doing with his church now amen the prophet God only needs one man just let him get one man in his hand the world will think he's crazy but he will drive home the gospel when he's thoroughly convinced that Jesus Christ Remains the same yesterday today and forever under anything else he will stand true and go on Amen Prophet goes on to say God only wants one man that he will that he can fully get into his complete control amen you see just like our artificial intelligence needs to get to a place where he does not need human intelligence anymore God is trying to get his shirts to a place where he doesn't need man's intellect anymore but we can rely on the Supreme intelligence of Christ Jesus amen if we can get to the stage where we are fully surrendered to him yes amen artificial intelligence is the simulation and mimicking of human intelligence by machines to understand learn plan and perform like humans and the Church of God when it has the Mind effect starts to behave the same way like Christ it starts to mimic Christ amen it starts to simulate The Life of Christ amen and so Christ has come down on the earth so that when he connects to the body we can do the Greater Works The Works that Christ did we can do also amen amen amen you see AI performs in Stars by going through certain process services and it ingests inputs amen and data points and we as the bride of Christ we have taken the book from the hand of the mighty Angel and we have ingested in amen we have digested it amen and by doing so we have analyzed the data points amen and now we have that Supreme intelligence amen within us amen God is achieving this through his church yes amen amen why so what is God's purpose amen we see God is trying to achieve a church amen that can come to a state that is so fully surrendered amen amen so full of the mind of Christ amen that can be spiritual astronauts amen amen that can defy the laws of the earth amen that can defy The Impossible God is trying to achieve a people amen that can take a body change amen God is trying to achieve a people amen that can do the Greater Works yes amen this is what God is trying to achieve yes so the question tonight is are we serving God's purpose amen with labor not what God is trying to achieve what is God's purpose but are we achieving God's purpose amen and we can I can confidently say Amen this year God Amen through his church he's achieving his purpose amen amen I came without a shadow of God saying God is starting to achieve with his church what he intended to achieve amen and that is why he descended Amen in 1963 that is why he descended amen for this very purpose Amen to achieve in his church amen that which is achieving now yes Hallelujah and it's the same power amen but just multiplied in the church it's the atomic power that's fueling the church amen amen that became now break past the sound barrier and defy gravity amen amen so nothing is impossible now amen amen because it's not a weak fate it's an atomic Faith amen it's an atomic power hallelujah amen amen I don't want to keep you much longer amen but I just want to go through a portion of scripture amen because I said to you that when man is trying to achieve something amen there's always opposition to it I mean God is trying to achieve something there's always opposition to it yeah and many times you'll see that the opposition comes from within your ranks amen amen amen so I'm gonna go I want to attempt to the page of Joshua amen I just want to go through it's it's a long chapter but I'm going to go through quite quickly just to show you aiming how you can get opposition from within your lungs now bear in mind this is Joshua chapter 22. it's very close to the end of Joshua this is the last chapter of Joshua is 24 Joshua times the Holy Ghost amen so we almost join here to the end of the age of the Holy Ghost we have chapter 22 we're about to go into chapter 23 we in the year 23 2023 when the angel of the Lord wants to move amen so in chapter 22 amen then Joshua summoned another really something because this is the NIV version amen then Joshua called the rubinites and the gallites and the half tribe of manessa and said unto them you have kept all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you and have obeyed my voice in all that I commanded you amen so they had their Prophet Moses and they've kept all that Moses has said amen you have not left your brethren these many days until this day but I've kept the charge of the Commandment of the Lord your God and now the Lord your God had given rest unto your brethren as he has promised them deafana return yeah and guarantee your chance and to the land of your possession amen so it's time to get back to your land of inheritance your land or possession which Moses the servant of the lord gave you on the other side of the Jordan but take diligent here to do the Commandments in the Lord which Moses and the servant of the Lord charged you to love the Lord your God and walk in his Commandments amen let's go down so Joshua blessed them and sent them and they went today unto their tents now to the one half of the tribe of monessa Amen we can just go a bit more down here Joshua blesses them you can go a little bit more down and the children of Reuben and the children of God and half the tribe of Minister returned and departed from the children of Israel I remember Israel disciple now the message as a whole amen but here there's two and a half tribes which is a minority compared to the rest of the tribes of Israel amen is departing from the children of Israel which is in the land of Canaan to go on to the country of the land through the land of their possession so this minority is going to possess their own land amen where they were possessed according to the word of the lord The Hand by the hand of Moses and when they came under the borders of Jordan amen so they're about to come to the crossing point remember we close to the end of the age of the Holy Ghost and they're about to come to the crossover point amen that are in the land of Cain and the children of Reuben the children of God and half the tribe of Vanessa birthday an altar by Jordan a great author to see too and the children of Israel heard saying and said behold the children of Reuben and the children of God and the half tribe of minessa have built an altar over against the land of Canaan in the borders of Jordan at the passage of the children of Israel and may the children of Israel heard of it the whole Congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves and Charlotte to go up to war against them so here's this minority group now that's meant to possess their land they're about to come to close to the crossover point in Jordan and they put up an altar and here the rest of the children of Israel wants to oppose them now and the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben and to the children of God and to the half tribe of minessa into the land of the lid Phineas the son of Elisa the Peace So now here comes the high intellectual people of Israel amen the priests and with him 10 princes these are all the high people of Israel now of each Chief has a prince throughout all the tribes of Israel and each one was and head of the house and their fathers among the thousands of Israel so these are great people now in Israel and they came unto the children of Reuben and the children of God and the half tribe of manesa into the land of Gilead and they stayed with them saying thus said the whole Congregation of the Lord so not thus say the Lord now does say the church what just passed is this that you have committed against the god of Israel to turn away this day from following the Lord in the history of build and also that ye might Rebel this day against the Lord is the iniquity of poor too little for us from which we are not cleansed until this day although there was a plague in the congregation of the Lord but that game has turned away this day if I'm following the Lord see so they reprimand in the minority group now and they're starting to quote what has happened it was it will be seen in the battle this day against the Lord and tomorrow he will be rot with the whole Congregation of Israel so Israel is saying you put up this all tonight you've gone against the Lord and they start to quote all that has transpired they start to quote all the scriptures they start to quote all the quotes now and they're going up against this minority group not but standing in the land of your possession be unclean so they say now this land that you are going to possess if you can't clean don't pass over it come over and enjoy and paraphrase and I'll come over and enjoy our position so if you're not if you're not happy with the possession that you're going to take come and enjoy our possession in building your but don't rebel against the Lord not rebel against us in building you and altar besides the altar of the Lord our God amen now they start to quote what happened to Aiken let's go down and the children of Reuben and the children of God and the half tribe of Vanessa answered and said unto the heads of the thousands of Israel the Lord God of gods the Lord God of gods he know it and Israel shall know for if we be Rebellion in other words if we have been rebellious or if in transgression against the Lord save us not this day that we have built Us in also to turn from the from following the Lord or if to offer their unburned offering on meat offering or you have to offer peace our friends they are on let the Lord himself require it if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing saying so now they give in the reason why they built the altar now amen Israel has contracted this idea that they are rebelling against the Lord now here's the reason why they built the altar and they said stay at the end of us and they said in time to come your children might speak unto our children saying what have you to do with the Lord God of Israel for the Lord had made Jordan a border between us and you yay children of Reuben and children of God you have no parts in the Lord so shall your children make your children cease from make our children sees from fearing the Lord so they are saying that one day your children is going to rise up and say that you have no part with the Lord therefore we said let us not prepare and build us an altar not for burnt offering not for sacrifice but that it may be a witness between us and you and our Generations after us that we might do the service of the Lord before him without burnt offerings and without sacrifices and with our peace offerings that your children may not say to our children in time to come you have no part in the Lord so they are saying we have both this altar to be a testimony and a witness before you and I amen that we are serving the lord you are saying to us don't go into your Possession come and enjoy your possessions but we have our possessions that we need to inherit we want to serve the Lord and this is a witness that one day your children cannot rise up and say that you are not serving the lord but Israel was wrought with us they started that they started to build up this also now in the beginning of this year amen didn't a minority group amen start to rebuild the ulcers amen didn't restart Amen in the beginning of this year start to say you know something is wrong amen why isn't God moving amongst the ranks of the message which is Israel amen why is God not moving in the way the prophet said God was supposed to move and we started to rebuild the altars of the Lord and we started to confess our wrongs we started to rededicate our lives amen we started amen this remember is just before the crossing point before the Lord comes before Jordan just before chapter 23 amen amen the beginning of the year amen we started to do this now I'm not going to go on to read the rest of the scripture you can read it when you go home but then when Israel hears this they now start to get revived and start to realize that they were wrong and Israel starts to say oh please be to God because of you we are not saved because of what you have done amen we are saved now from the wrath of God Amen and that is why we not think likely of what God is doing amongst the minority groups amen don't start to think that'd be just a small group of people here amen because God uses the minority to set the rest of lays amen God will use something so small to smile to spark something the rest of the body of Christ amen and then they will start to see that okay this is why you preached What You Preach amen maybe people might have been thinking be fanatical and we keep on preaching every week about the supernatural we keep on preaching every week about doing the Greater Works but very soon they are going to start to see amen very soon that fire is gonna start to catch on to them and they are gonna start to see that they are being saved from the wrath of God Amen because the minority group has put up the answers again amen amen a minority group has started to rededicate their lives I'm not only referring to us yeah I know that God is doing a work amen throughout the world Amen amongst minority groups amen amen but then you'll watch how the intellectuals now will start to come against it amen you saw that the high princes of Israel said of the time against him amen and the high priest started to come against it but amen God is doing a work amen they started to serve God's purpose they put up the altar to serve God's purpose amen hallelujah amen amen we can stand tonight amen spiritual astronauts [Applause] amen hallelujah oh sorry I have to give you a mouthful at the End Amen but I want you to show you amen how opposition can come against amen what God is doing yes amen so don't be despondents when we get opposition amen I'm reminded of of the old movie of the Apollo 13. amen when this was the one failed mission they tried to go to the moon and this was the mission that failed and when they went to the Moon they had to instead of landing on the moon they had to figure out a way to orbit around the Moon to springboard them back into the Earth amen and the only way that they could do this was there was a group of Engineers on the earth in Houston that had to Now guide them in the spaceship what to do and they could only use the materials that they had on the spaceship so they started to run out of oxygen and all of these things and the engineers on Earth had to use what they had in the spaceship they are not trying to invent them a model that could help them preserve oxygen amen and over this however they were communicating by a voice they instructed the astronaut how to build these things using what they had amen so we as the Church of Christ amen we can only use what we have amen amen in our ranks amen which is the word of God Amen amen and the great engineer a man can put this word of God together amen we can't just do it on our own but he has to guide us from the control tower which is the Holy Ghost amen so let's pray and say God guide us yes yes we need Lord that connection to the control tower oh Lord we need that connection with you the Supreme intelligence oh God we need to get rid of our own intellectual intelligence oh God but we need to be so full of the mind of Christ so full of atomic power oh Lord oh God that you can work in US Lord Jesus they're all things Lord become possible to us who believe oh God that Lord we are no longer Earthbound oh Lord we are no longer creatures of the Earth but Lord we are now our father getting up into the heavenlies oh Lord Oh Lord there's such an atomic power in the church Lord if we can only access it Lord if we can only realize oh God the power that lays within us oh God oh God that we can do the Greater Works Lord that we don't have to be Earthbound oh Lord oh let us get connected Lord this evening Lord let us Lord restore that connection to the control tower the radar of the Holy Ghost oh Lord Oh Lord that we will not be let us stray Lord Oh Lord we will not be left just orbiting around into nothingness in space Oh God but Lord we will have clear Direction Lord we will have thus saith the Lord oh Lord we will have the direction of the Lord the will of the Lord oh we thank you God for super church we thank you Lord for super race oh God we thank you Lord for Spiritual astronauts we thank you Lord for that super sense of God the superpower that come down to perform the third Polo Lord Jesus a super anointing oh god

forever amen I believe he can still do it this evening amen Hallelujah yes thank you if thou can't believe that all things are possible amen believe us with all this yes a many many men glory be to his name you know I'm reminded of the testimony and I keep sharing this testimony there was a 82 year old man last year that was in a meeting and normally when you're 82 you're living with maybe high blood pressure and you're living with ulcers and you're living with sugar diabetes but you're in the service as the preacher began to preach amen the power of God Came Upon This Man and he didn't even know it woke up the next morning this man issues glasses he woke up the next morning and normally when you sleep you don't even wear glasses so without glasses he opened up his eyes and he had perfect vision and he's wondering what happened to him amen he got a yield of ulcers he got a yield of sugar diabetes you're going to yield of high blood pressure if God is concerned about an 82 year old man yes the same power is here to touch you to deliver you to heal you what did it amen I don't want to shock your theology but the prophet never healed anybody amen the prophet couldn't heal anyone yes all he could do was raise their faith to a level to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ who is the one that does the healing amen if you don't mind I want to turn this camera off amen praise the Lord
