God is looking for soldiers amen amen not people that will abandon the battle amen where is my helpers this morning we have another mic amen praise the Lord where's a [Music] Genesis 3 so the Lord God said to The Serpent and I will put my enity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed he will crush your head and you will strike his heel asiah 7:14 therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign behold the vir will be with child and will give birth to a son and will call him Emmanuel Isiah 96 For unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the government will be upon his shoulders and he will be called wonderful counselor Mighty God Everlasting father Prince of Peace amen Matthew Matthew 1 Matthew 1 this is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about his mother Mary was pleaded into marriage to Joseph but before they came together she found out to be with a child through the holy spirit because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and was unwilling to disgrace her publicly he resolved to divorce her quietly but after he had pondered this things on an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream and said Joseph son of David do not be afraid to embrace Mary as your wife for the one conceived in her is from the holy spirit amen he will give birth to a son and you will give him the name Jesus amen because he will save the people from their sins but Joseph when Joseph woke up he did as the angel Lord commanded him and embraced Mary as his wife but he had no Union with her until she gave birth to a son and he gave him the name Jesus amen amen the birth of Jesus for Qui and in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God the city of G named Nazareth so a virgin exp to man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said hail Thou Art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among woman and when she saw him she was troubled at his sing and cast in her mind what manner of salutation there should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold thou shall thou shall conceive in thy F and bring forth a son and shall call his name Jesus he shall be great and he shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall re over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon the and the power of the highest shall overshadow thee therefore also that Holy thing who shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God and behold that cousin Elizabeth she had also conceived a son in her old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called bar for with God nothing shall be impossible and Mary said and Mary said beh hold the hand of the Lord be it unto me according to Thy word and the angel Luke 2:4 so Joseph also went up from Nazareth in gilee to Judea to the city of David called Bethlehem since he was from the house and line of David he went there to register with Mary who was pledged to him in marriage and was expecting him expecting a child while they were there the time came for a child to be born and she gave gave birth to her firstborn a son she wrapped him in swaddling cloth and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the in the Shepherds and the angels and and there were shepherds residing in the fields nearby keeping watch over their flocks by night just then an angel of the Lord stood before them and the glory of the Lord Shone around them and and they were terrified but the angel said to them do not be afraid for behold I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people today in the city of David ex savior has been born to you he is Christ the lord and this will be a sign for to you you will find a baby wrapped in swadling cloths and lying in a manger and suddenly they appeared with the angel a great multitude of heavenly hosts praising and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace to man and whom his favor rest when the Angels had left them and gone into heaven the Shepherds said to one another let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened which the Lord has made known to us so they hurried and found Mary and Joseph and the baby and was lying in the manger after they had seen the child they spread the message they had received about him and all who heard it were amazed at what the Shepherds said to them but Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in our heart the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen was was just as the angel had told him amen amen thank you amen let's give him a hand for being good children and reading to us this morning amen the Lord bless you amen praise the Lord amen it's wonderful to be reminded about how the word was made flesh and there was such detail such Precision amen amen that God would reveal himself to so many different people and everything that he had fixed and planned he had written in the scripture amen and they were coming to pass according to the scripture amen so let's stand together for a morning message amen hallelujah we'll speak amen for a subject amen our Christmas gift the word made flesh in US amen praise the Lord I'm getting that from the message so before your religious demon gets powered up amen calm it down we'll read The Prophet's quote now I'm just taking his title amen praise the Lord our Christmas gift the word made the word made flesh word of God made flesh in us right and for sub a title I'll say following the Angel's message to find the word made flesh God has a pattern God has an order you got to follow the Angel's message to find the word made flesh amen so we're not looking 2,000 years ago for a baby in a Manger we looking how Christ is revealing himself through us now amen so amen we'll turn to our Bibles in Matthew Chapter 2 so they basically read if you were following the first promise in Genesis that the seed of the woman will bruise the Serpent's head and they followed Isaiah 7 Isaiah 9 amen coming all the way prophecy until it was fulfilled so God doesn't want to let his scriptures remain as promises written in the word only he's going to see that it comes to pass amen amen so in Matthew Chapter 2 it says now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of erod the king behold there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem saying where is he that is born King of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship Him Now I want you to notice as we read not only are they seen a star they weren't just following the Stars amen praise the Lord Lord so they saw the star in the east and they have come to worship him when erod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him and when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes and the people together see they forming together a council of churches now amen a Unity he demanded of them where Christ should be born and they said unto him in Bethlehem of Judea for thus it is written by the prophet so they go to the word these are not just targ J us they are basing it on the word they're going to micaiah's prophecy right right amen amen amen praise the Lord now they're going to read the prophecy and thou Bethlehem in the land of Judah and not the least among the princes of Judah for out of thee shall come a governor that shall rule My People Israel then aod when he had privately called these men wise men inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared and he sent them to bethle and said go and search diligently for the young child notice now he's a young child because two years have passed and when you have found him bring me word again that I may come and worship him also and when they had heard the king they departed and lo the star which they saw in the East went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was when they saw the star they rejoiced and were exceeding with exceeding great joy joy and when they were come into the house they saw the young child with Mary's mother and fell down and worshiped him and when they had opened their Treasures they presented unto him gifts gold frankincense and more and being warned of God in a dream that they should not return to Aid they departed into their own country another way amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word amen you may be seated I want to read one more portion of scripture amen if you can find me Exodus 23 there brother amen praise the Lord we'll read from verse 20 it says behold I send an angel before thee to keep thee in the way because people want to get out of the way but the angel is going to keep you in the way and to bring thee into the place which I have prepared now which was the prepared place the promised land yes sir okay so it's going to be a journey he's not only going to take them out of Egypt but it's a journey he's telling them where he's going to take them amen beware of him and obey his voice so we are saying following the Angel's message to find the word made flesh so we got to obey the Angel's voice amen provoke him not for he will not pardon your transgressions for my name is in him amen Hallelujah yes sir and if we have the true revelation of his name now that name is still in the mighty Angel yes sir amen praise the Lord amen but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice and do all that I speak then I will be an enemy unto thine enemies and an adversary unto thine adversaries for my angel shall go before thee amen praise the Lord amen if we can put up the first quote there brother bradam in white out to be Shepherds he's closing his prayer and he's saying he praying in Jesus Christ's name we receive your Christmas gift what is a Christmas gift is he going to tell us Jesus in a manger but watch how he ends it we receive your Christmas gift the word of God made flesh in US am that's our true Christmas gift so we're not only rejoicing at the birth of Jesus we are rejoicing that Christ is now made flesh in us the true Christmas gift amen so if you a grinch rejoice and receive your Christmas gift amen the word made flesh in you oh yes hallelujah praise the Lord amen that's in the message why they to be Shepherds the true Christmas gift is the word of God made flesh in US sir amen so the key to walking in any of God's promises and living in the blessings of our inheritance for our day is to hear and obey the voice of the angel amen we can show you this in all three Exodus there was an angel leading them we just read in Exodus 23 the angel is going before them now remember also in type Abraham sending Ela to find a bride for Isaac is a type of the Prophet being sent to find a bride for the Lord Jesus Christ Abraham reveals that the angel is going to go before him amen that's right so in the first Exodus we find that the angel LED Moses amen and obeying the Angel's voice led the children from isra out of Egypt amen Into the Wilderness but even when the God won't let the promise stop short even with the unbelief of the people 2 million people disbelieved but God won't let the promise stay in the wilderness yes the promise was I'm going to take you to the promised land the promise is I'm going to take you out of this Earth whether you believe you're going to have a body change or not God is going to raise up a people who's going to believe in a body change amen hallelujah so even when the ministry changes from Moses to Joshua the angel of the Lord that was leading Moses is a still the same Angel of the Lord leading Joshua he said as I was with Moses so shall I be with you praise the Lord so we are not alone don't think that the prophet has gone off the scene and we are alone the angel of God is leading the church amen amen praise the Lord now we can't follow halfheartedly or unwillingly 2 million came out of Egypt and died in the wilderness amen amen because they refused to follow the word of God the instructions of Moses amen who was being led by the angel of the Lord amen now the Angel's message was going to take them through justification the prophet tells us death of wilderness it was going to take them amen through the Jordan which was sanctification it was going to take them amen onto the banks of the Jordan which was the restoration of the gifts but that's where the Pentecostal Church stayed with the restoration of the gifts amen but now we are coming into the promised land the baptism of the Holy Ghost the prophet is telling us Ephesians parallels Joshua so Joshua taking them into the Promised Land Is Us receiving going into the land of the Holy Ghost which is the message of the hour amen like as I was saying just a short while ago we can choose to allow the word of God to remain as a promise as an unted resource but unless the word is received by faith and made flesh by believing the word hearing the word recognizing the word and acting on the word of God because the Bible says all of God's promises are yes amen but it requires an amen yes it says all of God's promises is a yes and amen Amen brother Brandon was relating the story to at write as a yes but she said amen to the word yeah she didn't just leave it as a amen an audible testimony she connected with that testimony you see how when somebody else is sharing their testimony with you you can share in that blessing that's right amen hallelujah yeah we read the quot before the prophet of God was was telling us about how this woman was was hear amen she was overhearing some people talk badly about the prophet of God and she stood up for brother brandham and brother brandham amen the angel of the Lord came to brother brandom and told brother brandham because she stood up for you tell her she can have what she wants so the angel of God is hearing our conversations yes amen if you'll remember when when uh when brother Bram came to Durban South Africa and he he wanted the angel told him come to Durban but the ministers were just tying his hands and they had another schedule and they even told him brother brandham maybe the Lord will allow us to go into the permissive will and he says bully Paul came into the room and he told me Dad don't listen to that bunch of preachers brother Bram goes on to say that the angel of the Lord told him amen that's why he allowed him to see the angel of God he said because he respected Billy Paul for standing up and telling his father don't listen to those ministers the Lord allowed him the privilege to see the angel of the Lord so there's a great blessing and a reward amen if we follow the Angel's message amen amen amen amen so we are saying all of God's promises are yes and amen God's promises are positive amen and are waiting for you to say an amen yes sir so don't leave the promises of God on a printed page yes sir amen all of the promises of God in the scriptures must be that must be fulfilled today by the bride must be brought to life by allowing his word to manifest in US amen don't leave healing of your body to remain a promise in the word believe the promise of the word that he was wounded for our transgression Bru from our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and by his stripes we were healed amen even now you can receive it amen don't leave amen don't be in lack Jehovah Gyra is here amen we can make a claim and withdraw from the bank of Heaven even this morning Our Father HS a cattle on a thousand hills amen we are the children of Abraham amen and we are blessed with faithful Abraham we can't just be singing Abraham's blessings are mine and then we're looking for end out every time how about amen we access Heaven's Gates amen how about we get rid of some unbelief amen and contact Jehovah Gyra how provider amen amen sometimes we allow situations to bind us amen circumstances to Hold Us Down amen Hold Us Down in our mind amen Hold Us Down in our thinking amen I want you to be liberated this morning if things you never thought possible about your life amen believe that they are possible for your life amen you don't always have to be amen somebody who's just getting along with Meer fa amen believe that God has called you for this hour believe that God has anointed you for this hour believe Amen in the promises of yourself amen yes sir it's easy to believe somebody else's promises it's easy to believe that Malachi 4 Prophet was William Bram it's easy to believe you as Revelation 10 but that's believing the scripture of somebody else how about believing the scripture of your day that God is Anointed you if he calls you he equips you amen if he calls you he anoints you you are called in Revelation 10 to take the book so he's not going to leave you unequipped he's not going to leave you a not anointing he's going to equip you and he's going to anoint you that is why the final part of Revelation 10 is telling you go and prophesy again you must know that this bride is highly anointed amen highly gifted highly revelated Amen to sound a word of Prophecy amen amen don't be bound by circumstances Jesus has broken Every Chain Every Chain of depression Every Chain of anxiety Every Chain amen of every Circumstance the Bible says he whom the son of man has set free is free indeed amen yes sir amen salvation is free also we can allow that word to remain untapped amen but Salvation is a free gift of God the Bible says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life that's right but people don't want to believe in the sun yeah hallelujah amen amen now we find we were talking about such detail man talking about how the angel of God was was so instrumental in that first coming of Jesus Christ if you were so instrumental in the first coming don't you think he would be instrumental in the second coming right amen amen praise the Lord MH hallelujah amen yeah we find ourselves amen yeah amen even as one of the brothers were reading there about how the Angels Came to the Shepherds but notice how many people the came to he came to the father of John the Baptist Zechariah to reveal to him that he was going to have a son yes and his name was going to be John amen hallelujah he he comes to Mary to reveal Amen to her that she's going to conceive and bear a son then he comes to Joseph in a dream so don't don't question now the angel of God Appears because in the Bible you're reading that the angel of God can appear to Joseph in a dream amen and the angel of God can appear to you in a dream Hallelujah you can get a physical visitation you can get him in a dream amen hallelujah and you can also hear him by hearing the testimony of the Shepherds Hall praise the Lord but you are still from the angel praise the Lord so the angel comes to Zechariah Angel comes to Mary Angel comes to Joseph and the angel comes to the shepherds in the field praise the Lord amen the most unlikely place now notice even scripture must be fulfilled because Jesus is not in Nazareth yet he's still in the womb of his mother but Moses I mean Joseph and Mary are not in Bethlehem they need to get into an environment oh yes they need to get into their position their scriptural identification oh yes they need to leave the city that they are in amen so God raises up amen attacks yes sir God will raise up circumstances in your life to either get you to the place where you need to be or stop you from being going to that place hello are you are you oh come on now are you following the voice of God or are you just going after the dictates of your own heart God will raise up a circumstance amen so that you can see that sign don't be a ba him now yeah amen yes sir amen if God is going to lead you somewhere amen and he's raising up red flags all over don't go any further Hallelujah don't go with a crushed leg like bam trying to get to the back part of Israel and trying to curse Israel every time he tried to curse he blessed hallelujah amen now God needs to get them to Bethlehem why amen they need to get to the house of God's bread Hallelujah they need amen because maybe preparation I'm just it's not written in the Bible but I'm saying maybe the fancy preparations of jesus' birth were already made in Nazareth maybe they had the crib yeah they had all the fine clothes but by raising up the taxes they must go to their City God took away all their preparation yeah because that was not the place where they supposed to be born Jesus was supposed to be born so they couldn't travel with a crib they couldn't travel with their pram sir they couldn't travel with all of these things they had to just pick up their stuff and get to Bethlehem when they got to Bethlehem they didn't even have a reservation amen Brothers think about what a beautiful conversation you have had with your [Music] wife amen hallelujah there would have been intense moments of Fellowship oh yes praise the Lord amen because now he's taking her the Bible says there was no room in the end so he took her to a Manger Hallelujah and there Jesus POS the Lord God positioned them to be born there in that place why God needed them to be in that position in that location to fulfill the scripture but also to be in position so that the Angels who were nearby in the field sorry the Shepherds that were nearby in the field could also connect with this word amen yes sir the prover of God says for the first time now amen the message would come to an unlikely place and he says could it be again that the message would come to an unlikely group and unlikely people amen hallelujah a place that people don't think much of us amen he says could it be that we'll find him in this unlikely group of people in this unlikely place amen Shepherds will know nothing about theology praise the Lord bypass all the Nobles bypass the clergymen bypass all the somebodies and reveal it to nobody's amen amen that's why they ask the question do you mean God would bypass J of Roland and reveal it to you they can't understand it it's not meant to be understood with the human mind you mean God would bypass Fred Roberts God would bypass bully Graham or Roberts and all of these great minds and reveal it to you that William brandom is Mali 4:5 and 6 and he is revelation 10:7 to bring you a word to reveal to you the hidden mysteries of redemption amen praise the Lord amen amen so the Lord would bring the greatest message that there ever was amen imagine for 4,000 years they had waited for this promise but the greatest message that Messiah is on the earth now was revealed to Shepherds amen praise the Lord amen God takes noodies and makes them somebodies God can take nothing and make it something amen amen so we've got to strip ourselves of our own abilities and say God I'm depending on your ability amen praise the Lord now notice amen the these angel I mean the Shepherds these Shepherds were not non-religious people yes they believe the Angel's message which showed you equality about them amen they had the ability to hear the angel's voice and to receive that word from the angel so amen imagine now amen at the speed of light brother Brandon says those Angels Came amen came there to the shepherds in the field and announcing amen glory to God in the highest peace on Earth and Good Will towards all men for in this day in the city of Jerusalem is Born To You Christ the Lord amen hallelujah he says what a message Amen to receive what a declaration he says for the first time the man had heard the angel sing the first group of people that heard Angelic voices amen singing was a bunch of shepherds amen Hall praise the Lord amen and the prophet of God here in this message why there to be Bethlehem says they found him in the message they found this message of the messenger in the manger exactly where the angel said it would be now notice they go and they follow the Angel's message to see if it is true so they don't leave that promise unfulfilled they go to the manger and they go to find Jesus hallelujah praise the Lord who was reading about uh the Shepherds here brother Caleb or Matthew somebody was reading about the Shepherds you can I have that piece of paper amen praise the Lord Glory I want you to find something here I don't want to take too long to go and find it I I already printed this out so I'd rather find it here let's go the Amen in uh The Book of Luke chap 2 Luke chap 2:15 it says when the angel had left them and gone into heaven the Shepherds said to one another amen so after you receive an an Supernatural experience there's still a part that you must do yes are you going to get into action or are you just going to listen to the word they said to one another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see the thing which is come to pass which the Lord had made known unto us there's a part for us to play so they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph and the baby who was lying in the manger after amen so they came with the a amen next verse and when they had seen it they had made known abroad the S which was told told them concerning this child they didn't remain quiet the Bible says that the Shepherds made known abroad they extended the borders of their prophecy amen hallelujah you say but how could these Shepherds leave the 99 sheep the Shepherds left the 99 sheep and they going and sounding the message abroad who are taking care of the sheep praise the Lord amen these men amen left the 99 to go seeking the one true Lamb of God amenah Amen they left 99 to find the one amen amen praise the Lord thank you not one that is lost but the one amen that was never lost amen the perfect Lamb of God yes they went to seek that one amen not one that needs saving but the one that had come to save yes praise the Lord not the one that wonders through creation but the one that's the Wonder of creation amen we should always be willing to leave 99 things on our to-do list and seek the one true Lamb of God Amen thank you Lord praise the Lord amen let's read now they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning the child amen and all they that heard it wondered that those things which were told him by the Shepherds praise the Lord amen but Mary kept all these things and ped them in a heart so the Shepherds started a Ministry they started to go everywhere telling them Messiah is on the earth now am I'd like to believe that they sounded that ministry right throughout Judea right throughout Jerusalem and Bethlehem amen they sounded it to everyone who would hear the Bible is clear they sounded it abroad and everyone who heard marveled at this word amen amen amen so the Shepherds have a work to do the Shepherds know where to find the word made flesh amen the Shepherds can identify the lamb the Shepherds can get into a Manger amen amen though it be amen a stinking manger though it be a hard word the true Shepherds can go into those places and identify the word made flesh amen you know how brother brand would dramatize it can you imagine Kus the high priest going into that manger he said he would have turned up his nose at the stench can you imagine the scribes and the Pharisees they wouldn't have had not want to have nothing to do with that manger praise the [Music] Lord amen but but can you imagine the joy in their heart when they found Jesus because the angel had given them the message and it was exactly as the angel said I'm driving this point for a purpose right right amen because just like how the angel LED them in the first Exodus the angel was now leading in the second exodus yes sir amen but the angel wasn't just going to leave them to find the word made flesh the Fulfillment of the Angel's message would come on Acts chapter 2 amen when the Holy Ghost would come down amen God didn't just want to be with them but God wanted to be in them in the first Exodus it was God above them in the second Exodus it was God with them amen but on the day of Pentecost it was God in them praise the Lord amen so God knows where to send his message God knows how to change the environment Amen to let the word be made flesh in your [Music] life amen amen so God had to bring the word into the shepherd's environment he says when the Shepherds heard the Messiah was on Earth and came into his presence right in their own environment and found the message to be true was Vindicated there how it must have made those men feel to find that God had done this great thing of them amen so that's the shepherd's message amen that Messiah is on the earth now praise the Lord amen so we we can see now that following the angel the Angel's voice will lead you to the promised word to the word made flesh Hallelujah along the way you're going to get naysayers along the way you're going to get people that tell you the land is filled with giants but there's also evidence of milk and an amen they're carrying grapes amen amen amen so watch what voice you are listening to because 12 Spies were sent to Canaan one from each tribe but 10 came back with an evil report that we are not able to take the land but only two said we are more than able amen hallelujah that was Joshua and Caleb praise the Lord so we find included in the story is the specifics of the Angel's visitation finding Jesus rep in a Manger in swaddling cloths the angel LED them to the word made flesh so I'm driving that for a point now because we're going to come to the Highlight where the angel is now driving us to find the word made flesh in our lives if we don't see the word made flesh in our lives there is no Rapture that's right amen amen amen let's come to our own manger this morning praise the Lord amen the angel LED them amen the angel of God in this day is not going to lead you to A Jesus in a manger but to A Jesus in bright form cuz Jesus is now revealing himself through you and I so we have a parallel to the first coming in the second coming of Jesus John was the Forerunner of the first coming William Bram was a forerunner of the second coming John turned the hearts of the fathers to the children William br turn the heart of the children to the fathers amen amen praise the Lord now we know that Jesus came to redeem us by paying the price with his own blood he ascends to us to intercede for 2,000 years amen he's making intercession to those names that were written in the book from before the foundation of the world amen amen and Revelation 5 he takes back the title deed to man's Redemption and in Revelation 10 he brings it back to the Earth amen he brings man the original amen inheritance to take man back to the original condition bringing them back to fellowship bringing them back to Dominion bringing them back to eternal life and eternal life requires a new body I can't have eternal life in this body so God is going to change this body amen we shall be changed I say we shall be changed we shall be changed amen changed from Mortal to immortality in the twinkling of an eye praise the Lord amen so John pointed them to the word made flesh he says Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world John the first Forerunner pointed them to the word made flesh Jesus ran and pointed Amen to a word born a word formed bride sir he always prophesied about this bride because John the Baptist was amen a forerunner of the head yes I want you to get this Jesus Christ and his bride are one body one unit John was Pro was was a forerunner of the head William Brandon was the Forerunner amen of the body of Christ praise the Lord amen calm your religious demon down we read the quote now amen praise the Lord amen this formation of the word born bride was a process now we know we the word born bride just didn't come about yes sir because we know amen that the ride had gone out riding yeah and the cankerworm caterpillar palmor and Locust had eaten up the church it had all died down right amen but God raised up a Luther with justification yeah this is now the forming of the Bride yeah amen he raised up a Wesley with sanctification he raised up the Pentecostals with the restoration of the gifts three stages of the restoration but he wasn't going to leave us there on the bench of the Jordan he was going to take us all the way into the revealed promised word of today by sending Malachi 4:5 and 6 by sending Revelation 10 to bring us all the way into the land of our inheritance amen so the people who are now exposed Amen to the preaching of the Shepherds amen sermons and the angels that bring the revelation of God yeah yeah amen now remember the Angels brought the teaching the Shepherds brought the preaching praise the Lord and they preached for two years messah King is on earth now what have we've been preaching since Revelation sounded amen Revelation 10 sounded if since 1963 we've been trying to tell the world Amen that Messiah is come back with a shout amen that's our message amen amen he is here he has descended with a shout what is the shout to gather the living Saints amen it's a message sent to gather the people of God we have a sure word of Prophecy yes we have been prophesying all these years but they don't want to hear the shepherd's message they don't want to hear John prophesy again yes sir praise the Lord amen we are preaching now amen and the Shepherds preach for two amen for two old years amen they're preaching thundered through Jerusalem amen the Bible says all that they that heard the shepherd's message were amazed you tell people about Angelic visitations seven angels in a cloud amen they'll be amazed yes praise the Lord now it even got to the house of Herod yes sir they're preaching Rock the religious world it rocked the political world yes that when these Magis came after two years and they asked where is he born King of the Jews it brought a political disturbance into herod's household why would if they were insignificant men why would their message asking where's the king of the Jew Jews and settle the king that's right do you not only important news gets to the [Music] king amen they must have been filtering what kind of news gets to the king but here they were asking there's some strange men that are inquiring about this so you find the a call calls all the scribes the religious people and he wants to know what's this about and they must have told him about a prophecy that's right amen yeah so he troubled his mind so much that he starts a persecution now same demon yeah was in the first Exodus right kill all the first born two years and under because they didn't want MO Mo to be born that's how Moses ended up in the Nile same demons different bodies the demon that was in Pharaoh was the demon that was in arod yes absolutely and it's in the same demon that's in these abortion people kill The Unborn if it was there the first Exodus it must be there in the second Exodus and it's here again in the Third Exodus amen yeah amen praise the Lord amen so under the influence of this Shepherd's message under now hearing amen the the the mag's message that they had followed a star but they were also coming with a word amen praise the Lord amen he starts a persecution so don't underestimate the shepherd's message don't underestimate the mag's message don't underes toate the sound of your prophecy you may be thinking it's not causing religious disturbance I want you to know every time you prophesy you are rocking the Demonic world you are rocking the religious world Amen you may be seeing things not happening here but in the spiritual kingdom of God you are throwing atomic bombs you are throwing weapons of your Warfare amen every time you pray you are de causing Devastation and Annihilation to Satan's kingdom a child of God the prophet says the weakest one on his knees is more powerful amen you got to start to believe in who you are you got to start to believe that you are the anointed of this age God has not called somebody else God has called you so God needs your voice to thunder through amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah so things that are happening on the earth is because of the bright prophecy amen amen ples are coming into Play Amen laws are being passed like how pass a lawyer to Kill The Unborn or to kill two years and under laws are being passed because you are prophesying again and as you are prophesying again amen they need to speed up their part of the prophecy because they are trying to kill the word from becoming flesh so they introduce things to the world to make you settle into a latery and lukewarm spirit amen to not get infused with the word to not allow the Angel's message to have a full effect on your life to get involved with work life to get involved with social life life to get so clogged down amen and bugged down with the cares of this life that the Angel's message has no impact upon you because they are trying to kill the word from becoming flesh in your life don't be deceived amen by this lean Spirit don't be deceive but the voice of the devil in the same time he keeps you involved amen with M and things of this world trying to make you chase a rainbow amen amen yes sir amen because that God has called us into the greatest message that has ever struck the face of the Earth no other group of people have a message with the title deed that Adam lost in the hands not even the the apostles at Pentecost could say that they had the title deed back in their hands because it was not released at that time the word the full word was released now in the end time through Revelation 107 amen amen amen praise the Lord am amen praise the Lord amen amen amen hallu let's get to that first quote there in the Rapture now watch we don't have time to get into all of it there's a quote there maybe you'll find it if you can he says the word as is in the bride as it is in Mary which word was in Mary am Jesus Christ who put that word in Mary the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost created a sperm and put it inside the womb of Mary amen think of how powerful that is think of this holy ghost that you have the Holy Ghost itself has creative power yes sir amen the Holy Ghost living in you as creative power am yes how how about we unleash him how about we give him full access praise the Lord now just like how the Holy Ghost put the seed in Mary to bring forth a son physical sonen the angel of God which is the Holy Ghost has come again now that the bride is been resurrected the head was resurrected now the body has been resurrected from denominationalism from religions of the earth God has resurrected the bride remember the message I don't have time to get into all what a resurrection that was and he says what a resurrection this is to be quickened to lifeall so he says now Jesus wants fruit of for himself his wife must bring forth the kind of children that he is so Jesus doesn't want you to be a beautiful wife just dressed in your Royal apparel he wants you to get pregnant hello amen his wife must bring forth the kind of children that he is somebody tell me what he is starts with w he is the word so the kind of children that we must produce is word children then if it doesn't bring forth children bright children wor children then it's the denominational child praise the Lord amen then her first love for the world and denomination she's gone back to death and it can't bring forth the real genuine born again Christian cuz there's nothing there to bring it forth so Jesus hasn't come Amen to find a Barren wife yes sir very clearly in the Rapture messages one of the last messages he says Jesus wants fruit for himself Jesus wants children word children bright children amen praise the Lord yeah he says in the message now the spoken word is the Original Seed that's what's the matter today you want some kind of phony makeup with screaming jumping speaking in tongues something instead of waiting for the real word to be made manifest through the [Music] bride them kind that takes the word is God's true bride bringing forth children amen amen they can't can't die a child the bride brings forth on the word can't die because it's the word yes did you get it she can't die that child can't die because he's a word child he's a seed child he's an eternal child hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen yeah in the message I'm just trying to get all these quotes in amen so we can bring it to a close now at the as the end as the end time prophecies will rep repeat I believe as the first Forerunner came from the Wilderness and cried yeah now I was trying to show you this before that John the Baptist pointed to the Head William Brandon points to the body he is it now he's saying it here as the first for came from the Wilderness and cried Behold the Lamb of God the second Forerunner will probably do will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride amen so both forerunners are pointing to one body yes sir one is pointing to the Head the other is pointing to the body everybody's understanding that point amen amen praise the Lord yes so he says the second Forerunner will probably do the same by pointing the people to a word born bride that's why he says they will come in church there's been churches churches Brides brides churches churches but they must come one right he says amen uh she be a super Church a super what is he doing pointing you to a word born bride doesn't he keep pointing you amen should be a super Church super race if she gets to recognize who she is what she stands for amen she can do the Greater Works Satan will be powerless before she'll be an invincible Army what is he doing pointing you to a word born bride amen amen hallelujah amen telling you she's bone of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit she is him amen yes that the The Head and the body are not two it's one amen praise the Lord amen he says the bride of Christ will be pointed to the sky at the appearing of Jesus screaming Behold the Lamb of God will come forth from his lips God help us be ready for this near event hallelujah amen he says but you remember when it went down the grain began to ripen before that grain can ripen everything in the stalk had to be dead can't you see where we standing life is in the grain again what is it just exactly like the same grain that went into the ground the same Jesus in somebody read it for me the same Jesus in the same Jesus come on now that Jesus had healed the blind oh that Jesus that caused a man's hand that was with it to come forth that Jesus that turned water into wine that Jesus had raised up Lazarus the same Jesus in The Bride form amen same can you not change it brother I didn't have my Pro neutal to have that power there I like future life it's got amino acids some people don't have capacity they're not excited about the word look there what are he saying look at the potential that lays in you I'm trying to activate it this morning to let you follow the Angel's message so that the word can be made flesh in you and bring you your Christmas gift am amen oh yes Lord thank you Lord amen thank you let me read it amen hallelujah turn to your neighbor and tell them there's some pral for you the word is coming now amen we're going to get energized praise the Lord amen praise the Lord amen he says the same Jesus in bright form same power same church same thing same word the same word sucked up these through and come out here come to aead here and all the life has come through here picked up its people people now forming up into a head for the Rapture speaking on that tomorrow night next night the Lord willing so the angel of God is now leading us to the word made flesh in our own bodies Jesus in bright form amen he says in the message invisible Union and a man that's born of God a Son of God has to have the nature of God he has to be like God now I want you to understand when he's talking about nature when he's talking about being like that's to deal with their name amen because a name represents the nature a name represents character of what something is the name represents the essence of what something is the name brings definition everybody understand amen so they have to have the same nature of God has to be like God he honors God he's part of the word of God and in this last days of this bright taking form just exactly the same power he was at the beginning has come up through these organization so forth and come out for the bride he can't be nothing else but that amen oh I am praying amen that this powerful bride amen with the same power with the same anointing will start to awaken to our true potentials he says you are the pure virtuous sinless Bride of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus and believes every word of God stands as though you've never sinned in the first place you are perfect you are perfect you are perfect tell your neighbor you are perfect amen tell your neighbor you are perfect amen some of you need to put up a mirror right now and say you are perfect because of the blood of Jesus Christ oh somebody praise the Lord Jesus the blood has cleanse me the blood has Wash Me praise the Lord you are perfect he says the blood of Jesus you see people are trying to depend upon their own works but the blood of Jesus makes you perfect thank you Lord thank you Lord he says sometime the Capstone will return somebody tell me what the Capstone is somebody tell me the Capstone is love he says sometime the love will return the head of it all and receive the bride unto himself which the woman is took from The Man a part of the man jeans of the man is in the woman exactly what the Holy Ghost did by putting the gene inside Eve sorry inside Mary he says jeans of the man is the woman what makes the woman and that's the way the word of God is in the church what makes the church the bride you see what makes the church the bride than you Lord let's read that slow and that's the way the word of God is in the church and what makes the church the bride yes so that's why when he's preaching the revelation of the seals now he's got the word that's come from eternity and he's going to put it in the bride so he says I no longer call you church I call you bride what makes the church the bride putting the word in the bride amen amenah amen it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to you see the word that you're going to the home you're going to needs the word it's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to where is God to prepared you've got to be a real word bride of Christ and so will the church come through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost in Brackets he puts there restoration of gifts so they didn't have the full one right he says right on into the formed image of Christ Christ the bridegroom the church is the bride and the bride is part of the bridegroom it'll have to be the word church not a denominational Church it'll be the word church a word that's known and with the Vindicated word of God Amen and in closing I'm going to tell you like we said a name represents character a name represents the essence of something that's right you can't go to a road and call it a lily a lily doesn't describe a rose each one has its own character its own nature you can't go to a lion and say Hello Kitty Cat amen try to catch a cat and Str try to catch a a lion and stroke its man you can't a name represents its character name represents its nature so I'm asking you in today
