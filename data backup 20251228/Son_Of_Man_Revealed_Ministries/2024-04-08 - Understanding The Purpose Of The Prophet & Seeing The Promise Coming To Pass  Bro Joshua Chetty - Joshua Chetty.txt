with the church yes not ashame to be Associated to say that I'm a Christian I belong to of church but when we associate with Jesus Christ we associating with the word and we are amening every word amenu we are believing every word that is given unto us and we are we are not angry with his word we love his word so much amen every time we listen to his word and by Revelation it stimulates us amen we are stimulated by Revelation amen yes amen amen thank you Lord we got our Bible this morning we'll take uh the reading from 1st Samuel chapter 16 we're just going to continue on a few thoughts that if you was there in the Wednesday meeting you'll understand that an anointing dropped inspiration dropped and there was some thoughts being spoken and we're going to continue from there amen amen hallelujah 1 Samuel chapter 16 [Music] and the Lord said unto Samuel how long will thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel yes amen fill thine on with oil and gold I will send thee to Jesse the bethlehemit amen the house of God's bread amen amen for I have provided me a king I have provided me a king among his sons so he's got many sons hallelujah amen you have to be that one in a million amen and Samuel said how can I go if Soul it he will kill me yes oh this is not going to be popular yes oh this is not going to be popular amongst the organized church amen and the Lord said take an ier with thee and say I am come to sacrifice to the Lord and call Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou shalt do and thou shal anoint unto him whom I name unto thee amen hallelujah hallelujah Sam is going to go there and he's going to see with his eyes yes but that's not going to be good enough yes amen God will have to show him amen yes and he said and thou shallal anoint him whom I name unto thee and Samuel did that which the Lord spake and came to Bethlehem and the Elders of the the town trembled at his coming and said comest thou peacefully this is an anointed man of God Amen you know when he come he's got discernment when he's come he's going to rebuke he's going to chastise he's going to bring correction he's going to bring dust say the Lord he's not going to compromise with the word amen amen so he was respected for that because Samuel is working in full stature amen he's got all seven virtue with him amen he's a prophet of God for his age amen and you know a prophet is God to the people amen and the Elders of the Town sh is coming said Come Thou peaceful peacefully and he said peaceably I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice you can't come anyhow any anyhow and as aitly to the sacrifice absolutely amen amen you got to sanctify yourself you're coming to the church you got to come Sanctified your preparation should start the day before amen amen having yourself under inspiration keeping yourself Sanctified for the Lord's service amen amen and he Sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice and it came to pass when they were come that he looked at leab and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him amen but the Lord said unto Samuel not on his countenance amen praise the Lord on the height of his stature because I have refused him amen oh God is not interested in how how polished up you might be on the outside amen he's not interested how what a nice suit you way what elequent words you can speak amen for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord look at on the Arts amen amen then Jesse called Abad abinadab and made him pass before Samuel and he said neither had the Lord chosen him amen then Jesse made Shamar to pass by hey surely Samuel must have said hey this is something now he's got the name of the Lord with him the Lord is present before us amen thank you Lord he said even look at his name but he said neither had the Lord chosen this again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord had not chosen these and Samuel said unto Jesse are you all thy children and he said they remain it yet the youngest all the 11 our workers amen and behold he with the Sheep yes and Samuel said unto Jesse send and fetch him yes for we will not sit down till he come hither yes amen you see that's in verse 11 yes amen amen and he sent and brought him in now he was ready and without all of a beautiful continence and goodly to look up and to look look to and the Lord said AR rise anoint him for this is he then Samuel took the oil oil of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren amen and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to R amen you may be seated am so he find that's the first anointing of David amen that's the first time David was anointed when the word of the Lord came to him by the prophet Samuel amen amen that was his the first anointing yes that was an anointing before his kingship amen amen anointed that you are now chosen that you are called out amen amen and that's how the message came to us amen the word came to the prophet and we caught the Revelation and we were called out amen and we received an anointing amen now we were told who we are amen thank we also go to the book of 1 Chronicles 11 the book of 1 Chronicles 11 then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Eon saying behold we are thy bone and thy flesh and moreover in time pass even when Saul was King thou was he that led us out and brought us in Israel and the Lord thy God said unto thee Thou shalt Feed My People Israel and thou shallal be ruler Over My People Israel therefore came all the Elders of Israel to the king to Eon and David made a covenant with them in Eon before the Lord and they anointed David King over Israel according to the word of the Lord by Samuel yes amen now what is said it will be the refilling of the Holy Ghost amen it be the Dynamics of this church will be what the refilling of the Holy Ghost so when you first anointed we had the mechanics we had the word to clean us up to get us to set our feet on Solid Ground amen but there had to come a time there had to be a changing of a season amen hallelujah she had to change from Saul Amen to another kingship amen yes there to be a changing of the Season before the Dynamics come down amen hallelujah and Saul was on a different tribe but David tribe come and Judah come from Judah amen and where do we come from the Royal seed amen amen we come from The Lion of the tribe of Judah amen we Anointed with the he anointing in this age because why we are living in a prophetic age but we come our original lineage come from the Royal seed amen amen we come from a kingly kingly lineage amen yes amen hallelujah yes so David David's anointed and he says yes so David Works greater and greater for the Lord of hosts was with him amen verse 9 open to 2 Samuel 5:1 and David went on and grew great and the Lord God of oost was with him amen amen amen so you can't stay the same you have to change from Glory unto glory amen amen because this word is not just come it's come for a purpose so I'm speaking this morning on understanding the purpose why the prophet came yes and seeing the prophecy coming to pass in our life amen amen there was a prophecy about us that there'll be this bride that will make a Rapture amen because God after we received this word god anointed us to confirm to his word to confirm to what the prophet was telling telling us was the truth amen God had to anoint us yes to believe that Amen to say what the prophet telling was the truth yes amen because many artists can receive this why they don't believe it but God had to anoint you to receive this amen amen but where your experience come from David experience wasn't coming in the palace he was not King as yet David's experience was coming in the wilderness amen every one of us have to have a back of the desert experience every son of daughter of God must be tried and tested oh when the trials are when the trials are coming don't say Lord take this burden away from me yes because now you that means you are quitting you don't want to be test remember God has put the tutor over us yes amen the tutor is there to give a report when we every test comes amen amen but say Lord rather say Lord in his time strengthen me Lord strengthen me to overcome Lord L Lord show me show me what I ought to do do according to your word Lord amen yes take me back to your word Lord and show me what the scripture says about the situation Lord amen amen so we find that we are we started to understand the purpose of why the prophet came the message God has placed us now we've come under the right baptism we has placed in the local assembly yes now you've got to comeand an assembly amen now many people will say no but I've got the messages and I'm listening to the messages but God has called a five Mery for a purpose now remember sheep cannot lead themselves if sheep are loone they will go astray if sheep are loaned the Wolves will attack them yes his sheep are alone they cannot find food for themselves they cannot feed themselves they got to be L to good pastures to Green Pastures they got to be led to the water amen hallelujah amen that's why God has sent Shepherds amen amen and then you began to understand the purpose now that God just he called us there and he began to deal with us that's why he placed Us in an assembly when you come in assembly and you come out from Egypt what happens you began to to now take off all the makeup out stop bobbing your hair start dressing up right start behaving like a Christian start talking proper language take away all your vulgarity amen stop all your things from the world Amen what was that the first pool contact In the Flesh amen amen that was your first pool contacting the flesh Amen in your local assembly amen right and then as the anointing started come and the power of the Holy Ghost in the church to the anointing because the Bible said we do not pre we do not come with enticing words but with power and demonstration of the Gospel amen so the gospel is preached with power and demonstration then what happened the word began to contact your spirits amen those demons that were hanging over you amen those demons of lust yes those demons from generations of those generation curses upon you was hanging over you maybe from your parents and so forth it was hanging over you then what happened became the second pool began to contact your spirit contact those demons through you and cast those demons out through the preaching of the words amen amen but now is a different season amen now is a season where the word to the Holy Ghost now is contacting your soul oh yes because Lord this is now Harvest Time and harvest time is at the end of the world because this is adoption time amen you are being tried and tested through your testing in the wilderness and the tutor was giving a good report but now you come to your adoption ceremony amen and it's the time for him to give a good report about you yes amen and now is the time to contact your soul whether you are truly believing the words or you are just there to set ify your conscience in the message of the hour because many people will be and I'm I'm I'm telling you this very seriously we got to evaluate Our Lives amen and see if we understanding the purpose of why God send His prophets God sent his Prophet so that he can bring people back to adoption again so that he can have his sons and daughters coming back to the original condition again amen amen because not remember we coming back as Kings and Priests but before you come King you got to come priest Hallelujah but Adam started off as king yes as dominion over the Earth so we are going back to what was started amen but we start from priests amen amen but Adam started a king but he ended up going to priests after the fall amen he was Priest when he was worshiping with his father when he was worshiping God and he was Priest even when he fell he knew that if he left Eve she would die so he stepped in the Mediterranean Road amen but we starting or we going from priest to kingship amen but between the priest to pries ship and the kingship do we understand the purpose hallelujah amen so we find that according to Romans 121 and2 it says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that ye present your bodies a Living Sacrifice amen holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world Amen so already Paul is telling you about this world and then that why you talking about this world because there's also another world and there other worlds amen Enoch lived in another world Amen he lived on the other side of the flood it was another world yes amen and Enoch was a Serv from Adam yes amen and Enoch come into the full stature of a perfect man amen amen he not come into a position where he was the god man on the earth yes he was a he knew that Adam fell from this yeah Hallelujah it was revealed to Enoch that Adam fell from this condition amen and when it was revealed to him Enoch came into that condition amen he came into a condition of rapturing Faith but before rapturing Faith Comes Hallelujah Enoch was brought into a position where he could have dominion again Enoch could speak amen hallelujah Enoch you know Jesus could say speak to the mountain because the servant from Adam was standing there he could speak to the stone you go here you go there you go there you go there thank you Lord hallelujah and that's why in this day the seventh from the first second Adam Hallelujah must come back to that position again amen so Enoch now knew that that world that he was living in was going to be renovated yes by the flood yes and then you is going to be taken away from that world hallelujah amen and we know that this world we cannot be conformed to this world this world system which is Satan Eden where sin is glorified sin is glorified and it's so blatant now because 200 million demons are living Loosely on the earth because why if man don't give himself to the Holy Ghost what happens they're giving themselves to demon power yes amen and you might think hey I'm inan the message of the hour no if you never submit yourself to the yielding of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah if you never seed your bodies as a Living Sacrifice to him amen and made it only acceptable unto him if your body is not the atmosphere for God if your body is not the temple of God then what type of spirit is going to come in there yes I'm trying to contact that Spirit today amen because why every spirit that is contrary to God must be departed from the sou amen amen we want children of God here that are offering their bodies holy and acceptable unto God Amen that is our reasonable service because why we are the Temple of the Living God you must have the Revelation is our that God must dwell in you his Spirit his life must dwell in you so he says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind amen that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God Romans 8:11 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you now you that Spirit can't dwell in you unless you offer your body a Living Sacrifice many people quote that scripture but they're not willing to allow their bodies to be the temple of God hallelujah you can't be with God and be mixing with Egypt amen you can't be with God and be with the things of the world but in the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen amen so people we all want to say we want to speak we speak to this we speak to that we'll have dominion but they can't have dominion over their own body oh help us Lord start having Dominion the Earth First amen start having dominion over yours amen and let his Spirit come in you and that will bring you to his faith amen virtue knowledge Temperance amen godliness brotherly kindness and love amen it'll bring you there it's his spirit that will bring you amen we want to see today what pleases God Amen yes God it pleases God when you understand the purpose amen seven th has come to take you out of that Amnesia he come to say you this is your purpose amen that you a son and daughter of God Amen you know I was giving a talk to the family the other day I was telling them you know we're living in a time where believers who call themselves Believers don't know the Bible they don't understand the things of God because they they got so used all these years we satisfied with our conscience that we just believe a message and we come under the safety of that under the security of that that is why when you go into the world and now when you are faced with the Enemy or you are faced in a situation where you have to spread this gospel you get twisted around because we know we mock at denominations we mock at the people of the world we mock at woman preachers you know there's a lot of woman in the world that know the Bible yeah now you're going to preach to them preaching them telling that they shouldn't preach but are you going to take them to the scriptures and show them that how you going to take them to the beginning that he was so how you going to take them to all these things showing them serpent seat and so forth if you don't know this word that's right amen amen coming to church we coming okay the most you come is two times some people one time a week and then how many time that you are really going and dedicating yourself now to present yourself a Living Sacrifice yes sacrificing giving your time and effort to God yes studying the word help us Lord yes listening to the messages amen let's be serious today amen we believe this word this is a glorious word the Bible says unto much is given much is required amen yes Lord much is given unto us Lord you see it comes back to knowing what's the purpose you see that we don't understand the purpose of why this Prophet came we thinking the prophet just come to give us a message and as long as we believe him and that he was a prophet and God sent the prophet and we believe there was a pillar of fire there was a cloud that came we believe that that's good enough but what is it doing to you that's right amen help us Lord yes there's a difference I said the last time there the difference with saying I know the message and having the message in you it must be the the living of the the written of pistols must be in you amen Lord and must be manifested through you Lord the pistol that you the word that you are eating must be manifested through you amen yes Lord amen you that's the way you become the god man amen that's the way you have the confidence when the word is in you yes and now when you are in a situ you are able to produce the word yes amen no matter what challenge you are fac you are able to face the challenges you are able to produce the word amen and say Satan it is written yes amen but if you don't know all you going to say Satan amen help us Lord yes you know when a Jewish child is born they T the child from small he must know the scriptures yes the Muslims do the same yes they know the they know the Quran and so forth we are living a we are influenced too much by the West we are influenced too much by the West right and the wst is always influenced only by your media and so forth with now you people are being influenced by TiK ToK by all Instagram by all these things all social media and so forth those are the things that are influencing them yes and it's gone so perverted now that people are will believe any lie people won't even go check out something if it's true as the first things that comes out social people will just believe it people have become so Gable now that's a man who doesn't know his position that's a man that don't know purpose because a man that know his purpose will know why he's waking up in the morning amen will know why he's breeding the next day amen amen will know why he has the bread of life because he knows his purpose amen William Bram came with a message that will catch the rainbow trouts hallelujah amen he went out with the first two pools just for an attraction but the main attraction the main bait was for the rainbow trouts amen many other things came along the way but but he was searching for that rainbow trouts amen he was searching for the wife of Jesus Christ Hallelujah he was searching for the one that will say be unto me according to thy words amen he was searching for the one that will have a home that will reproduce Jesus Christ again amen amen so when you understand that then you understand that you are part of God's economy yes and when you understand of God's economy you began to understand his kingdom and you'll understand now that now what David that Everlasting Kingdom we are about to go and set God is ready to set up his kingdom that's why you find the kingdom of this earth right now crumbling each one is falling apart amen because God is ready to usher in his kingdom yes amen and he's going to come there son of David's amen and we have been reigning with him amen amen so we find this Enoch Enoch knew his purpose Enoch could ever walk with God because he understood his purpose he understood what God called him for he he understood by Revelation by faith amen by by faith Enoch work with God what is Fai the Revelation amen and how we can have this faith is by the revelation of the word yes the word is revela us all the timeall amen because many can read the scriptures but until God anoints you amen so that is why you got to recognize Saul had to be done away with the kingdom because Saul now because one of the things as well because apart from being disobedient to God's word in the exact when the prophet told Saul you do this Saul refused to do that apart from that he also went to familiar spirits to the witch of Endor amen you wouldn't go to tamim if there's no Prophet you go to the Yum tamim yes Heen you go to the word of God if I put that in modern times now you are seeking counsel from the people of the world yeah your pastor is not important to you you don't recognize your pastor God working through him the five Ministry is that important to you the word that you got is that important to you you rather go to your friends for counsel go to your unbelieving families for Counsel on the things that you do people that are not saved yes people who are being influenced by demon power you're going to familiar spirits amen you think God is pleased with that that in the hour when you called you he gave gave you the opening of the word yes everything that you have need of is in this word yes but you want to go find advice somewhere else and you find that advice that's why you'll get messed up in your finances you'll get messed up in your jobs you get messed up in your marriages you get messed up in your relationships yeah every answer is in the word amen yes because that's what we are looking for in this hour what pleases God what is what would be sweet smelling Savor to him Amen to his nostrils amen he's come to take us out of this world be not conformed any longer to the pattern of this world Amen if you got a revelation of this word then you'll know that this world is going to be renovated yes yeah you know this world is about to be renovated and this Earth you will come back to but not this world Hallelujah it will be another world Amen you will come back to this Earth but not in this world if you understand what I'm saying this world system you will not come into de civilization yes because you from a different civilization you from an eternal civilization this is a temporary civilization that's why everything they give you in this world everything that you're trying to satisfy yourself would is All Temporary from the world but Jesus knows that you have need of house God knows you have need of a car he know you have he knows my children need these things to get by in his life because I put them now in flesh but he said seeky first the kingdom of God and his righteousness then all these temporal things the things that you need to get by in this life amen that shall be had unto you amen he will never see the righteous go Forsaken and neither would he let his children bake bread amen amen so why stress why fear he said don't worry about what food you going to eat what clothes you going to wear he said look at the lies of the field Solomon in all his Splendor was not a like one of them the sparrow there they they toil not but food is provided to them yes but you have to become a prisoner to the world when you understand your purpose you become a prisoner to the word amen amen you become a prisoner to a to a cause because you know it's worth it because this is eternal amen you become a prisoner to God's word and when you become a prisoner to God's word as Paul said I be a prisoner to Jesus Christ yes he called everything else as D amen he was a great Theologian in his day he was a learned person but everything that he knew everything that he attained he called it done and he said now I become a prisoner to Jesus Christ amen in other words he come on a full submission to the word yes because that word living in you it must have the preeminence over everything else over all your Ambitions yes over all the things that you want to acquire in the Natural Life the word must have the preeminence and when the word has the preeminence you will reach good success in every other thing amen you must Daniel had that good success there in Babylon yes yes Joseph had the good success there in Egypt but prisoner first tried and tested first am Hallelujah huj prisoner then went to rule amen and we're going to be Kings and Priests amen you can't come to kingship without being the prisoner first prisoner to the word not prison to the world system now don't don't get yourself in Bound you need to be delivered from that if you in Bound the Bible said what you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven what you loose on Earth shall be loose on Heaven if the devil is holding you in bondages morning I pray in the name of Jesus that you'll be Loos from that bondage Lord if you feel Lord I'm just born with a situation I have this negative attitude towards life because Lord everything around me was negative my family was negative so I will be negative no I'll say be loose in the name of Jesus Christ am the word of God has come to set you free he has come to preach the good news he's come to set the captives free amen the only thing you should become a prisoner to is full submission to the word yes Lord let the word have the preeminence in your life and the world will produce the rest amen because why the Dynamics of this church is a refilling of the Holy Ghost amen and that's the second anointing to the bride amen you come under the first anointing you come under full submission you come as a prisoner amen you come as a prisoner to the word giving the word the preeminence amen then it must become the time again that's why there was a season and if you got spiritual Insight Insight you'll recognize there was a season there was a season open up amen it was the refilling of the Holy Ghost in the church amen that was the Dynamics amen there was what to come do what to show you to now make you operate according to your purpose make you operate according to why William brandham came amen Sons and Daughters of God coming to adoption in this hour coming to maturity amen there was a time when he came amen and he said now you must be you must stay in the presence of the Sun and be right to be ripened because were green then but you can't be green for 59 years gone now in the preaching 1965 and from then till now it's 59 years you can't be laying in the presence of the Sun and saying I'm still green Hallelujah 59 years amen oh it's time amen when the fruit has been ripened amen the fruit is ready to produce again amen thou must multiply again Hallelujah you must become fruitful amen you become fruitful amen that's right amen Lord thank you Lord become fruitful in the things of God yes Lord don't remain stagnant in your walk with him amen amen amen Moses by faith amen he saw by Revelation he saw the how that he was living in amen and he was able to go a one man Invasion and take on Egypt amen by faith Elijah amen when he went to challenge those uh those uh false prophets there what did he do he already slew yes The Oxen Heen and he asked them to pour water before Anything Could Happen Yeah by faith he did that amen because why he already had a revelation amen that he was walking with god oh yes amen and when you have a revelation that the when you know that the word you're giving the word preeminence in your life then you know that you are walking with God Amen is that just walking with him but he must be in you amen the word must be in you amen must have the preeminence hallelujah hallelujah he must have lot you over your life amen hallelujah and when the word has the preeminence and I'm telling you now when you know that God is with you then then if he had to Ser you now walk on the water like how he said to Peter you won't say Lord Oh Lord only if I can touch your hand then I'll walk you say Lord because you said it I'm walking oh Lord I'm walking to the right now even though in Psalms 23 David said even though I walked to the valley of shadow of death I will fear no evil because why he knew that God was with him hallelujah oh thank you Lord now it was backed up because the prophet said it amen and he believed it and he knew that he was anointed for the hour he he knew he was the anointed man for the hour so no matter what the challenge is no matter what the circumstance is right now oh tell you this might be a small Church it might be insignificant right now but I'm telling you you get ready to impact the nation you get ready to impact South Africa and Beyond this country because God has called you for this hour man has not called you God has called you God has ordained you God has purposed that you will be here amen you'll be part of the assembly amen you are in Durban South Africa the place the angel of the Lord loved amen the place that the angel the prophet wanted to go other ministers he wanted to go to Cape Town they forcing him to go to Cape Town forcing him to go to J but the angel of the of the Lord had to show the prophet a lesson no I want you to go to deran South Africa because why there's going to be a people hallelujah I have a purpose for their people I have a plan for them Iain them to take the nation Iain them to overcome every challenge every circumstance I a that I will walk with them I will be with them even in them yes Lord hallelujah amen oh

say I'm going to say it very plainly to to make to for your benefit when we say the Holy Ghost positionally placing the people the Holy Ghost is working in the 54 Ministry the Holy Ghost in men anointed men anointed 54 Ministry positionally placing the people yes because the pastor as discernment yeah to contact that's the third pool now contacting the yes and say you positionally placed there you positionally placed there that's the Shepherd that God has given people say oh but I follow Jesus the shepherd yes Jesus it is Jesus working through the Shepherd that he's chosen in his hour the pastor of a church you positionally placed there you positionally placed there you shouldn't be doing that God didn't put you there that's what the that's what the pastor should be doing amen that's why pastors have discernment amen that's why if a pastor is saying you something recognize that God speaking to recognize God has given them discernment in the hour amen I'm talking about the true fivefold Ministry now amen so you see it's not an easy thing to be in the 54 Ministry okay we'll go to a quote it says in the message it is the rising of the Sun paragraph 92 and to be waved again we realize in the last day according to Luke 17:30 in the s o n day again in the day that the s o n of man will be revealed or waved again over the people now who is the son of man in the beginning was the word and the Word was with Goden and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and if all the teaching that we have and confirmation of the word of God by by word of God by sence by wonders we see today that in the book of lukia that we just quoted or Luke 17 and 30 and Malachi 4 and the different scriptures that we are acquainted with that the word gave is waved over the people that the Dead traditions of man is dead and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Spirit right Among Us and he's giving us life as Christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although typed in many places he was the first fruits of all those that slept in the bright coming of Christ coming out of the church that have there'll have to be a sheep waved again in the last days waving of the sheep what was the Sheep the first one that come to mature the first one that proved it was a wheat that proved it was a sheath Hallelujah I'm sure you see what I'm talking about it was waved over the people and the first one they'll come forth for the bright age for a resurrection out of denominationalism will be a message that the full majority of the word has turned back again in its full power and being waved over the People by the same signs and wonders that he did back there yes because I live ye live also speaking to his wife so if the prophet of God come in US hour in the seventh Church age in Son of Man Ministry and was a first wave Chief in this day then we are now at the weat time again because the weed the life is in the wheed right the life is not in the shock anymore yes there was a time when the life was in sh they had the gifts and so forth healing campaigns around the world there's no life there now because the weed is sucking all the life amen so if the life is here there must be another wave shift again many amen that was one example that others will come to maturity again if one come to maturity in this hour then there must be now in the end of the hour amen a whole whole lot of w weat coming to to maturity amen amen coming to the fullness coming by the quickening power of God Amen to be made alive in Christ by God's quickening power so you find that you can't remain and say 59 years now he's saying this he's preaching this message 59 years ago and you mean to say there they haven't been many again but in this hour I'm telling you now amen amen the sons of God yes that come to maturity again and they are being waved maybe it might be ins significant yes maybe it's over here in phix but they are being waved right now and it's going around right now you must spread forth amen amen if sons of God come to maturity others must follow then you know that others must come to maturity in this hour yes amen because why that must happen because why it is a body amen God is working with a body amen each one got a part to play a body we got a part in Phoenix others got a part to play other other places other parts of the world different Nation different tribes different tongues but they got their part to play in the body of Christ but we got to be positionally placed in our parts and whatever Lord the Lord done to us do it Faithfully amen do it diligently amen do not be thoughtful in doing it yes do it with all of your heart with all of your soul with all of your might with all of your strength amen amen because God has called you for that purpose amen amen hallelujah support the things of God support the kingdom of God Amen it says here in a paragraph 109 he says but there has got to come one there has got to come a real bride there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it amen it makes that church live more in the power of his resurrection amen amen there's a challenge out there to say that we believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you know that's a challenge to you yes the world say right if you believe Jesus the same yesterday then the works that Jesus did where where is it now but if you live a surrendered life a back of the desert experience amen a surrendered life then and you got the Dynamics in this day then it must produce again amen if you got the word in you then you got the confidence that the life that was in Christ is in me all that was in God he pour into Christ all that was in Christ he pour into the church and I'm part of the church amen I'm the call out one that's what church means it's a call out one I'm part of the call out one then all that was in Christ is in me right now that I must produce that word amen yes until we come come to that place until we find that place what God does it to do to polish the hubs what sorry what good does it do to polish the HS what good does it do to give her a face lift or a simiz cized job where there's no Dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics prove to be right they has got to be a dynamic to make it work amen no matter how much you can take the word and show you the Shadows show you the types and show you the revelation of it and stimulate the people but there must come a time where you must see the operation of the word amen amen you must see the Dynamics of it the word must become manifested amen amen you must be see the Life of Christ again you got to pull him out of History you got to pull him out of the scriptures amen and bring him to reality Hallelujah bring him in the present tense the doctor said you got cancer but you bring him there and say you demon of cancer I give you eviction orders in the name of Jesus Christ I'm calling the enforcer right now to come and enforce right now amen he's going to come and enforce this eviction order and he's going to pull you out of there amen so he said that's what he proved H Allelujah that's what he used to prove it wasn't only the word but he was God himself the Dynamics in the words am that made the body of Jesus Christ cold stiff and dead in the grave Shak into life and rise again and roll away the stone I am he that was dead so dead to the son said he was dead the moon said he was dead the Stars said he was dead all nature said he was dead and now the whole world has to recognize that he's alive again is not only the mechanics God's word he was the Dynamics to prove it amen and I want to say right now there might have just been people mechanics amen W around for years but it's a different season now the Holy Ghost is here to bring in the Dynamics take away your cold formal religion amen your dead stuff religion and I'm telling you right now the Holy Ghost is here Amen to bring this church to our life again with a quicking power to raise her up to a full potential amen she's got to come to a full potential and as being the groom the bride has to come forth cuz it's part of him and it can only be the manifestation of the fulfilling of all the revelations any others as spoke of the Bride amen it can only manifest if he does something different from the groom it isn't the bride oh Lord if the groom was casting out demons if the groom was Healing The Sick and we taking out Mark 16 God help us amen that's right she is flesh of his flesh yes amen bone of his bone amen life of his life amen power of his power amen she is him amen yes Lord as man and woman are one and woman taken from his side she had taken a spirit the feminine Spirit from him the flesh from his side made both mechanics and Dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the Flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and Dynamics hallelujah amen amen thank you Lord paragraph 113 it says until that church becomes both Dynamics and mechanics and the spirit of God that moved him to do the things that he did if it hit on 16 cylinders so will the bride yes for he said in John 14:12 he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also I'll give him a charge of my Dynamics in his mechanics Hallelujah that the world will not be able to withstand it amen and I'll raise him up again in the last day that's the Easter message the Dynamics and the mechanics together the mechanics without the Dynamics not good neither is the Dynamics without the mechanics so you see we had to have the mechanics first and now the season comes in when the Dynamics come down yes you was anointed the first time show that you are chosen to believe this message said that you are a bride amen that you are come out of fir our people the call went out come out of all my people I have chosen you to be my bride there was an anointing come upon you amen but then in a certain time in season and you watch the digital Prince of the Angel of the Lord coming to pour the Dynamics on the church amen that was the second anointing the refilling of the Holy Ghost to what to put you into service to put you into operation Amen to put you to place you to have an impact before you leave for your kingship amen hallelujah before you leave on the earth there must be an impact to bring him back to Dominion again to show you the purpose of full Redemption that's what he came to show you that you are there to come back into the full Redemption to come back into the original condition all that Adam lost there all that Adam was there you are going to be now amen the the only thing that will be outstanding right now is the final part of adoption which is the changing of the body but every other part speaking to the mountains speaking to the squirrel speaking to your circumstances right now every other part must be taken place in this hour and it's a very short window period the window period is very short I'm telling you now don't waste any time it's a win period getting the things of God hallelujah get into the things of God because it's a very short winter period because why while you are getting that Revelation right now there's a people waiting for a visitation there's a people waiting for the seven trumpets Hallelujah there's the people waiting in their Homeland Hallelujah natural force brought them in the Homeland they're waiting there for their part so you got to fulfill your part now you can scream and shout and jump up and down all you want to and deny this words it don't do any good you see I can tell you testimonies from 1960s and you'll be screaming you'll be jumping you'll be amening it but when I bring it back to you now when I bring it back to you are in the world this is your part this is what you're supposed to be doing he said you can't deny that you said no but Max that's for another day you know the first thing when people kill the the move of God you got you know the people that was killing the mo the Baptist yes when the working of the Holy Ghost was happening you said no that was the day for that was for the day of the Apostles that was for the apostles but what we forget we can tell them this we can take their own teaching to them and say you know what our hearts have been turned back Amen to the FI amen of the fathers amen am amen so that is why you can't believe it but we can believe it because you must the key to the age amen amen you must Malachi 4 you miss Revelation 10:7 yeah so you can Scream and Shout you just cranking around the Piston got the spark there to fire but no gasoline to fire it by it will only work as they come together amen they must come together so one will sit still and the other one will go up that's the only thing they is to it yet they both might look alike listen to this quote now both claim to be churches both claim to be bride but one has mechanics and Dynamics it brings it to pass what he said is the truth it just won't move no matter how good the mechanics is until the Dynamics come when the Dynamics come the fire is made to connect with that octane in the gasoline and when that explode it causes a combustion and that combustion moves every motion every move for e is the same yesterday today and forever that's the resurrection that's the real power of God mechanics with the Dynamics notice it's the spirit that quickens it's the spirit that fires it's not the gas that fires it it's the Sparks that fires the gas you can do nothing without me but with me you can do all things as he is the word it's the Liv it's the father living father sent me so send are you as the father has fired me and pushed me into everything I do only that which is pleasing to God now he said me so s are you with the same mechanics and he takes the same Dynamics to operate it and these sh sign shall follow them that claim to have the mechanics the Dynamics will take its place Paul said to us Paul said the gospel came to us not in word word only through gasoline only but through spark also to make it move there you are it came to us in that manner so you see we''re coming we growing up in the hour now amen the spirit of God when when you start to have a preeminence in you then he'll bring you to his faith Amen to his virtue to his knowledge to his Temperance through his patience through his godliness through his brotherly kindness through his love but he must be his life must be in you because you can't produce your own life it is his life in you his life being reproduced again he say how can I do it he say I can do all things through Christ Jesus amen who strengthens me amen as Christ God was in Christ now he is in the bride amen amen amen praise the Lord thank you Lord one more quote here what was the Holy Ghost given for now the church has come through those schools she married back Yonder a long time ago and became a denomination and organization but you notice the birth produced something else and now it's got to a place to where the Pentecostal church with the New Birth has been tested and tried and now it's coming to a place God doesn't deal with the church as just an organization he doesn't deal with the church as a group of people he deals with the church as an individual each individual in the church and now it's got to a time and it's no secret we'll all see it when a man proves that God loves him he takes him out somewhere to himself there in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts up there in the presence of God and Gifts him and fills him and sets him out that's the age that we're living in same holy spirit that saved the lutherans that Sanctified the Methodist that baptized the Pentecostals is Now setting in order the coming of the Lord Jesus when it be so powerful that body will come into this group a church that will draw the rest of them from the grave there'll be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is for what is the Holy Ghost for what is the Holy Ghost without us they cannot be made perfect they lived in one day and DEP we living in another day amen amen so all nature all creation is groaning even them beyond the grave waiting for sons of God to come into their position but sons of God are walking now in their positions but there's much more potential to explore amen there's much more land to possess yes you got to cultivate the land you got to make the land fruitful you got to make the land a blessed land amen and how and who's doing that it's the Holy Ghost through the fivefold ministry positionally placing the people amen feeding them what the potentials are feeding them keep reminding them of the identity yes because the devil don't want you to to remember your identity he want you to doubt your identity he wants you doubt you know what the first thing he does he reminds you of all your failures he reminds you of the all the weaknesses in the flesh now you now he makes you doubt your salvation and whether you going to go to heaven but when you the messeng has come to show you that you are you an eternal being amen an eternal being cannot be lost so why are you feeling what the devil is putting your mind yes if you're part of God you're coming from God's Eternal thoughts you just manifested in a time and season yeah your father and mother to meet at a certain time to produce a body for you to come and drop in there yes you he what I said for you to drop in there because the body is only housing you but we living in a time where there's going to be such a time everything must go back to the original even the body amen is going to defy the Earth the come from is going to change from Mortal to immortality the body is going to have a change amen so that's the time we're living in amen so that's the purpose of why God sent this Prophet amen amen to prepare us for this hour to prepare us to become a people that God can use in this hour to produce Jesus Christ again Amen to ambassad to to be ambassadors and representative of another kingdom because this world that we must not be conformed to now is going to be destroyed that's why Enoch could have that Revelation and Enoch would walk with God because he was walking with an eternal God because he knew he's going to he's not going to die he's not going to see death but he's going to go amen and Enoch is typing the bride amen amen let's stand amen thank you Lord thank you Jesus can I have the musicians thank you
