for your honor hallelujah amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen amen I greet everyone in the precious the holy name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen hallelujah it's good to be in the house of the Lord amen to worship Him amen you know the Bible says let everything that has breath praise the Lord am amen so that's our reasonable sacrifice to come and worship him and give him praise amen so we welcome every one of you in the house of the Lord amen good to see our brother Barnabas sisteron again amen may the Lord bless you amen hallelujah praise the lord we have brother ano ano is not local Amen brother ano Kumar is from India let's give him a hand amen amen amen his dad is a pastor in India so he's here visiting amen been with the Thomas family and now he's now with the David family amen hallelujah so we pray amen you be blessed with the word of the Lord my brother amen do you need an interpreter the only interpreter we have here will be the holy spirit because none of us can speak your language brother amen and then we have brother Wayne Amen let's give brother Wayne a hand amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen so we're going into the word of the Lord amen we were speaking last time time on the image of the word amen and we still got some thoughts around that because if the image is M then God must bring us back to the image amen praise the Lord so we'll turn to our Bibles in Genesis 126 we'll start there amen praise the Lord and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air over the cattle over the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them amen the Lord have blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen praise the Lord then we can go to Genesis chapter 3 and this is now after the four and the Lord is speaking to Adam and Eve and he plants the first seed of Promise he says the seed of the woman shall bruise the Serpent's head the first Prophecy in the Bible making way for the Redemption of man now God is a god of purpose amen when God's God's purpose will never be defeated if he has set man to be in His image amen after his likeness even though sin came in and Mar that plan he's going to bring a Redemption plan to bring you back into the image of God amen amen and I can't believe after seven Church ages and after Seven Seals have been opened the old opening of the word that we find ourselves short of coming back into that image and likeness something is wrong and it is not with God's word it is something is wrong with us and I'm going to be bold and say something is also wrong with the fivefold ministry because they are not positioning the people in the word they got them looking off on this thing and on this thing but they are making a mistake and not focusing on the main thing amen where God wants to find expression amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen don't be don't be alarmed amen you may be thinking why is the ministry going this way if I Am The Shepherd of the church a pastor mean Shepherd amen I must lead the flock of God which means I must be connected with the guide yes I must be connected with the spirit of Truth amen I must be connected with the teacher I must be connected with the angel of God Exodus 23:23 behold I sent my angel before thee to keep thee in the way too many people have left the guide too many people have left the teacher too many people have left the angel of God Amen we want to read in Genesis chapter 3 and show you here what God is saying from verse 20 here let's read 22 where the Lord is speaking and the Lord God said behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever so you see man had access to the Tree of Life this verse is confirming that therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life amen so even if man desired to eat of the Tree of Life there was an angel guiding the way back to the tree of life amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so the point we were showing you is that man the image of God the plan got stopped now the only reason God allowed the plan to be stopped is because God had thoughts of being a savior God had thoughts of being an healer God had all of these thoughts amen hallelujah of being a provider and he couldn't do this amen if there was no fall Hallelujah man would have been in his ought to be conditioned in a glorified body and they would have been no need for God to express all of these attributes amen hallelujah but in this logos now in mesic he's locked up all of these attributes that he needs to find expression have you ever wondered why the prophet says we don't see mesic anymore because as the logos is giving expression the only way you can now see the logos mdic is in the expression itself amen amen if you understand what I'm saying if you have thoughts in your mind and then all of your desires are fulfilled you will sort of empty it out into the formed Expressions amen so everything that was in the back part of God's mind will not remain in the logos anymore but it will fully Express itself on the earth amen so when I looking at you I'm looking at the expression of the logos thought of hellim Amen so I must respect you I must reverence you because you carry deity in your body you carry deity in your soul yes praise the Lord amen amen hallelujah amen so what we're trying to do is move the holy spirit is trying to move the Revelation from a revelation now to an experience amen hallelujah to a manifestation manifestation to make known Hallelujah now I I said this the last time what use if we reading the Bible and we see that that God is going to send a deliverer to Egypt to deliver the children of Israel now we come and we read the Bible we we go to Egypt and we say I have come to deliver the people they'll think you gone mad there's no children of Israel there they'll tell you hey Moses came years ago and delivered the people from here so you can't take another man's scripture and try to fulfill that scripture amen is what I'm trying to tell you amen neither can you take Malachi 4:5 and Revelation 10:7 and try to fulf fulfill it Luke 17 it's already fulfilled am amen hallelujah praise the Lord so amen we are not building here our lives on Earthly things we are building our thoughts on Heavenly things amen can you say Amen to that amen so what I'm trying to tell the ministry is designed to bring you to present tense now if you're reading in between the lines you'll know that he's saying a lot am the ministry is designed to bring you to present tense what the Holy Ghost is doing now I can't keep you locked in on a day gone by yes the logos has expressed himself through a Ministry the fullness of God was expressed we know that his back turned to the tent amen he was able to discern the people's heart but he says all of that was for a sign and he says the angel of God is on earth now fixing everything getting things ready for the coming of the Lord amen praise the Lord people still want to come with messages like you know if we're preaching evangelism it's fine I don't mind it but when you're preaching to a church come how can I preach you come out of all my people it's like me going to Egypt and say come out you have already come out yes what we need to do is reposition your soul amen amen people have the word but they don't know what what to do with the word it's like Eve in the Garden of Eden she had the word she knew the word she quoted back the word but she didn't know what to do with the word why she left the guide she left the teacher Adam was a guide amen instead of going back to a guide and a teacher she went onto the grounds of reasoning and she tried to handle the word amen that's why a woman should not handle the word amen your covering is your husband amen your covering is the holy spirit amen Hallelujah hallu so we find here that the Lord is putting a tree a cherub with a flaming sword to guide the way back to the tree of life amen so we are focused on that image now we need to get to Revelation chapter 5 amen praise the Lord amen I am trying to define the image for you that God wanted you to be in because if you're following the messages the prophet is telling you in that state when he said let us let us make man in our own image God had already condescended he had come from Spirit and he said out of the Spirit came the logos he says the logos is called the Son of God the logos is called the word amen and we know what that word body is it has a name and that name is MDC and he says it was in this form that God was in that he spoke and said let there be and it was in this form that he says let us make man in our own image I'm trying to define the image for you so that it'll be clearly identified what you need to become in this day am amen Revelation chapter 5 amen praise the Lord now we showed you where the the book is taken away the inheritance is taken away at the four right and how a flaming sword was put back there amen hallelujah now in Revelation 5 when the book is restored Jesus Jesus now comes to take the book let's see what they say now amen let's read from verse seven and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne amen and when he had taken the book The Four beasts and the four and 20 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of oders which which are the prayers of the Saints amen praise the Lord now the last time you remember we defined the 24 Elders the prophet clearly states who those 24 Elders are amen amen hallelujah and and you know now why John is going to be singing and worshiping because part of those 24 Elders is John there amen yes so John is seeing John but there's a Chasm there that he can't connect back with that body yes John is seated there as part of the elders and here is John watching the scene unfold and he's watching the lamb come and take the book and that's why brother Brandon in the message says John sees John but he can't connect with John so he starts to cry he starts to weep and brother Bram says that now that there's a there's a voice saying behold the lon of the tribe of Judah has prevailed and he says in the bridge message he comes out looking for his Queen he sees his Queen weeping John is a type of the Bride amen and this husband want to stand to see his bride weeping so he leaves the sanctuary coming out to see what is the matter why is my bride weeping amen thank you when he comes out he finds John wants to be connected back so he starts amen he takes the book from the right hand right hand signifies Authority right hand it signifies power amen he takes it out of the right hand of the one seated on the throne now it is not the Trinity being defined here it is the same God that is changing form the book is not changing hands but the one that is has the book is changing forms amen amen praise the Lord you understand that amen hallelujah so here he says and they sign a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for thou are slain and has redeemed us to our God now if you understand what redeemed us to our god means it means that everything that was lost to make that statement you have redeemed us to our god means it is finished amen amen God bless you I see brother Samuel also visiting this morning amen praise the Lord amen he has redeemed us back to our god redeem man means you must be brought back to your original condition amen redeemed means you must be the God man on the earth oh yes Hallelujah you say I can't I can't express that the lust wants to find expression through your body the holy thing that you should be short off in this hour this time and this season is the new body but in every other potential you ought to be in that image and likeness come on Church the message of the hour has come to do this for us we need to quit our nonsense amen hallelujah we can't leave the word not to be manifested it must be manifested in you and I now is not the time to have a crisis of Faith amen hallelujah hallelujah people are having crisis of Faith amen people are stumbling around amen the glare the glare of the Babylonian system he's proving too much for some people help us Lord but let the glory of the Gospel come in this morning amen say Lord bro on Me Lord Jesus I don't want to be influenced by the things of this world you say oh I I strug some of us are struggling in our faith amen and and the spirit of God is picking up that up this morning that some people are struggling in their faith they are finding moments of weaknesses in their lives and they are thinking that is the End Amen don't judge yourself by your present condition brother Bram says a son and daughter of God picks themselves up and runs back to the altar runs back to the blood runs back Amen to the of the Altar and says Lord forgive me just once more that's a sign of a son and daughter of God not to lay in your Fallen condition we find people giving expression to rism you say how do I give amen when you paint your face when you put on makeup when you put on a pants when you cut your hair when you act like the world you are giving expression of a Babylonian system you are giving expression to a jezebel system amen people are more afraid of the image of the Beast than of God yes they're more afraid they get terrified when they hear about the mark of the beast but when you tell them the Holy Ghost is here right now they are not moved neither are they concerned about his presence the presence of God is going unrecognized amen the bride on is on the Earth right now amen with the Judgment of God because when she speaks the word of God it his judgment yes yes but people are more scared I'm going to buy or sell yes amen yes don't don't be alive God will not be defeated amen if they are creating an image of the Beast God is making another body in His image it's a form's word image amen an image that will defeat Satan and his armies an image that will defeat the image of the Beast God will not be defeated you are the powerful Army that he's raising up in this hour amen amen the image of the Beast should be like a little mouse to you you're a mighty Army you're a powerful Army you're an invincible Army hallelujah oh praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord thank you Lord amen so redeemed amen when you hear that word redeemed know that you are fully restored in this hour amen you've got to allow the word to have expression amen yes oh hallelujah amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord I got to finish this thought amen because this is amen coming strong out don't have crisis of Faith amen people think you know you can be in the very presence of God and still have a crisis of Faith you can be in the service and still have a crisis of Faith amen hallelujah you say what do you mean here was Peter how close do you need to be Jesus to be to Jesus to know or to have perfect Faith because let me tell you you can be in his very own presence and still have a crisis of Faith yes Peter was there they saw Jesus coming on the water he said Lord is it you the presence came near the presence was right next to him he walked on water but then Peter had a crisis of Faith yes yes so being in his literal presence doesn't guarantee you that your faith is going to remain perfect you got to keep your eyes fixed on Jesus amen the Bible says that Peter looked at the waves he looked at his surrounding he looked at his sickness he looked at his circumstance he got his eyes off of Jesus Amen amen and he had a crisis of Faith yes people stumbling around amen can't keep the standard of the word amen that's the problem you are trying to keep the standard of the word when you're supposed to allow the holy spirit in who will keep the word in you yes sir amen this has nothing to do with you and I trying to be a good person amen God has sent the remedy he sent the Holy Ghost but people don't want the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is too demanding the the Holy Ghost is too restricting the Holy Ghost wants to govern my life the Holy Ghost wants to take over my life Speak Lord amen that's what they don't want the guy that was sent to lead the church the guy that was sent to teach the church they don't want in fact they've kicked him out and theyve replaced him with some amen standard of the message that was imposed upon by preachers amen what we need is some Holy Ghost fill men of God Amen back in the pilit amen to preach out of the church and get the Holy Ghost baptism back in the church hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord praise the Lord amen amen let's get back to our scripture they sung a new song Amen Thou Art Worthy to take the book open the seals thereof for thou are slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every Kindred tongue and people and Nations now what amen he's going to restore the image now and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests that's the image that's being restored in this hour you say what image is that that is the exactly the image of mzc mdic is King and priest can't you see it in the word amen amen that's mesic image he's both King and priest amen amen I don't come from a levitical priesthood amen I come from the priesthood of nedic I don't come from the tribe of Judah amen hallelujah hallelujah MZ is both priest and King mic is a logos you Lord I'm finding expression through that but I'm married to one who comes from the tribe of Judah I might be a gentile woman amen I might be like Ruth but I am married to one who comes from the tribe of Judah his name is Boaz he's the kinsman redeemer amen he has come in this hour to fully Redeem Me amen thank you amen Ru may have carried some shame Ruth may have carried some amen hallelujah personality disorders and amen maybe going through mind battles amen but he has come to cover you oh yes cover me extend the borders of thy mantle over me amen there's no need to be in condemnation there's no need to be in fear amen hallelujah Perfection is a greater level than forgiveness of sins people want to remain amen under the blood under the blood under Perfection of sin amen forgiveness of sins he has come to change your position amen you going to read the Rapture message he said this bride is Justified amen it as though she's never done it in the first place so how can you forgive somebody who's never done it in the first place justification moves you into a realm of perfection amen thank you Lord thank you Lord the blood and forgiveness of sins is for the church world but the bride has come he says there she is now standing there married to be to preparing to be married to the Son of God thank you Lord thank you which one of you marrying a girl will bring condemnation upon her when you marrying her amen are you going to remind her of her past or you going to justify her other people may say things against her but you say she has never sinned in the first place I am covering her amen by marrying her I'm taking her with all her faults and her shames don't you realize that's the reason Jesus died on the cross yes thank you hallelujah how can we walk around with our own sin when he finished nearly to the Cross thank I'm saying he's taken your past your present and your future and he's nailed it on the cross you are fully Justified come on enjoy the benefits of the message nobody else knows this amen the benefit of the message of the hour yes Lord living your Justified condition living your glorified condition now praise the Lord that has made us unto our God Kings and priest and we shall reain on the earth oh people now with this they got denominational ideas they go to funerals and they preach like denominations oh now you know we're going to go to heaven heaven is not our final resting place we were made for the Earth we were made to be rulers on the earth amen people say I can't wait to die and go to heaven you are not made to go live in heaven your body is designed to operate on the earth you're going to get so so disappointed when God tells you that day come we need to go back to the Earth you be ah amen Heaven is man's resting place you're going to come back as the God man on the earth praise the Lord the way with that foolishness when we die amen you're going to be in heaven forever no you're going to that sixth Dimension if you die now amen we're going to the seventh dimension for the married supper of the Lamb yes amen but when God has fully renovated the Earth amen when he amen made it foot for his Queen to come back and dwell upon yes amen hallelujah we shall come back to reign as kings and Priests on the earth thank you Lord praise the Lord now there must come a time when the angel if he wants us now and he's got the book right the book is the tree of life if I put it that way the way back to the tree of of life then he must come again to take away that flaming sword to allow John to get back to the Tree of Life the tree of life was guarded by an Angel a cherubim is an angel so there must be a point in scripture where the angel allows John Beth access to the Tree of Life am amen I know you're very smart you already know where we're in Revelation 10 amen that's our scripture we can only preach out of our position we can only preach out of our scripture brother Bram never went past the seventh verse because it was not for his time there is a group of people who can Define revelation 108-111 the only one that can give expression to Revelation 10:11 is you and I yes hallelujah praise the Lord amen so let's read Revelation 10 from verse 8 so we find here you know verse 7 says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets right and now very important now if you don't meditate on anything I need you to meditate on these scriptures amen meditate on Revelation 10:8 to11 and say Lord open it up to me what I need to do because this is now going to bring you back to the image that was lost and the voice which I heard from Heaven said unto me again remember this is the second time he hears the voice the first first time he hears the voice he's told not to write what the Thunder said this is the second time he hears the voice and the voice which I heard from heav spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standed upon the sea and upon the [Music] earth now you may be asking why didn't the angel come to where John is and give him the book there is a part required for you to do the angel is positioned strategically one foot on land one foot on sea yes amen why if you want to find out why you need to read Revelation 133 because there's a beast rising out of the land there's a beast rising out of the sea so he's there to suppress those two Powers because he's bride is on the earth amen why do you think that now they have formed everything do you know they've signed the final Treaty of world religions already signed two years ago yes it is now gone into implementation or can I say gone into expression form right the pope is not going around now trying to make people sign that agreement you go and search it out the final treaty the final uh petition for world religions it was already signed okay so why can't they make anyway in what they are planning to do what is holding them down down what is stopping them why can't amen America Flex its muscle and and do what they want to do why can't Russia who part of Prophecy do what they want to do something is holding back the winds yes amen somebody stopping them there's an angel stopping amen hold back the winds amen that's for the Jews but for the prde Revelation 10 is that scripture way suppressing those true Powers they're trying to raise their head but the foot is bringing them down amen so you find those two Powers can't make a move the Catholic church in the USA world religions and the USA image unto the Beast they're trying to find a way but Angel is holding them down so he's telling you get to the angel connect with the angel amen go and take the book now the same the angel came to Mary now we are another Mary right brother brandham says when the word was going to be formed in Mary he said that's when the persecution started when the word image was going to be in put into Mary the persecution started and what did she have to do firstly she had to respond to the Angel's instruction Mary didn't have to give Authority the last time we showed you who has legal Authority on the earth God can't use your body without you giving him permission he tells you the Holy Ghost is a gentleman he will not budge into your life Mary didn't find herself pregnant and the angel coming to explain to her how you got pregnant that's right he comes to her first to tell her that I am Shining Light upon Isaiah 9 and I want to express a n through your body and then she he says be it unto me according to Thy word so she allows now the logos to find expression through her body and we know that she brings forth amen the fullness of the word because this is the logos now condescending into flesh if you read John chapter 1 you'll see in the beginning was the word that word is the logos and the logos was with God and the logos was God Amen and then it goes down and it tells you and the logos the word became flesh that is why brother Bram says after Jesus came you don't see mesic anymore because Jesus is now both King and high priest if you really want to know mzc is the theophonic body of Jesus Christ that's the body he entered into brother brandom says he went back into the form he was before he came on the earth when he went to preach the souls that are in prison that is why Abraham could identify him that is why Moses could identify him that is why Ezekiel could identify him he went back into the form that's why brother Bram is dramatizing it and saying Ezekiel said he's a wheel within a wheel amen hallelujah Abraham is saying that's the one that came to me when I was sitting under that oak tree he returned back to the form before he became Jesus Christ and he went in that body to preach amen because you to go into that realm you need a word body you need need a theophonic body to go amen into the sixth to Paradise to entty out paradise you need a body to get to that Fifth Dimension to preach to souls that are in prison amen then when he rose up again on the third day amen he rose up a glorified body meaning there could be no separation between the the resurrected body of the Lord Jesus Christ and mic the two bodies had to become one to become a glorified body you and I will go through that same process amen the flesh body shall be changed and your theophonic body which is in the sixth Dimension shall come down connect with this body and you shall become a glorified body that is revelation right there give God an an of Praise amen amen so we are looking for the expression of that body amen hallelujah we are looking Amen to enter our glorified body so we find here he says go so what I was trying to tell you Mary had to give him permission Mary had a work to do on her part she had to speak a word she had to do something because what is true believing believing doesn't mean the prophet says hey I'm preaching in the street corner and a drunk man says yes I believe he said that's not true believing believing must result in a corresponding action amen you must repent you must change so if you truly believe the word what I'm trying to say the word must have an effect on you and you must have a correspond responding action so Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word I'm trying to tie it in with this when the angel said go take when the voice said go take the book from the end of the Angel the bride didn't need to move the bride didn't have to respond to that call and I think for many years she didn't respond to the call because why if I keep preaching to you it was all done by the prophetic Ministry all you need to do is believe the message of the hour that God sent a prophet there's no part for you to play it was all done there then you won't move I can keep you locked up in history yes oh yes that's why I say I need to bring you to present tense amen amen I can keep you locked up in history I can keep preaching why God sent a prophet I can keep preaching come out of all my people I can keep preaching don't wear pants don't wear makeup amen don't cut your hair I can keep preaching that and you'll die with them yeah amen sir oh yes you say ah how you say that well I'll show you in the Bible the Pharisees the scribes and everyone came and said we have Moses as our Prophet now you get puffed shirts in the mess we have brandom as our Prophet do you see how God used him mightily but when I go and play his tapes now he's telling me there shall come forth a people a bride will be in his very own image and likeness he says as she nears The Headstone she will be in his very own image and likeness in order to be United with him he says amen hallelujah she amen his life of his life Spirit of his Spirit word of his word amen in fact he says she is him amen now I'm reading all of that but you trying to tell me don't look here look there look there am but I want to look here hallelujah now this needs to be disobedient to this prees when they say don't take of this reel if you get what I mean now they are trying to keep you from the Tree of Life right yes yes now you need to be obedient to the spirit who says go take the book and eat the book everything that Jesus Christ work for go become it yes come into my image amen come into my likeness you know brother br God won't marry anyone that's not of his own image character nature likeness that's what this word is going to do now watch what happens when John goes to take the book now John responds you the bride responds you're going to take the book from the hand of the Angel okay amen it says here and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little [Music] book that sounds like a voice of authority yes yes that sounds like like I now recognize that I'm the legal owner of this book amen amen this book belongs to the Earth to a man yes give me the little book amen and he said take it eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey amen hallelujah when the word when you take in the word amen you become the word amen because the word is spirit and it is life amen you know Satan is totally confused how God is using the foolishness of preaching the gospel to bring you back into his word image he can't understand why you love to go to church he can't understand that there's something being done on the inward part of you when you are hearing the word that faith is being created amen hallelujah I have a faith generator which is making me a faith billionaire which is the hearing of the word the hearing of the word generates Faith within the believer and this is no ordinary faith we are moving the church from normal Faith to perfect Faith amen from normal love to agap love we are repositioning the church yes Lord oh thank you taking you from natural to Supernatural yes he says amen when you receive the new birth amen you become a two-fold being one of the earth and a spirit being amen of God praise the Lord so Satan can't understand what's happening it's a mystery to him amen that you are being formed into the word image into priest and Kings by you hearing the word amen he thinks that you're coming in one way and you're going in the same way amen he doesn't know that inside there's a change happening oh yes amen hallelujah there's a change happening amen so what is happening amen that food that word that John eats breaks down into his body goes into the bloodstream and becomes is life yes what am I saying the word is our life the word is our joy the word is Our Truth the word is our absolute we live by the word we breathe by the word amen the word is our life take the whole world but give me the word amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah amen amen it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was [Music] bitter right and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples Nations tongues Kings now last time I was showing you and the prophet showing you how the Holy Spirit comes for your birth and he comes for your adoption amen and the only ones that can give definition to the scripture is the Bride of Jesus Christ this is the bride's adoption ceremony because at the adoption ceremony we showed you in Matthew 17 how God adds words to his first words at Ma Matthew 3 in Matthew 3 says this is my beloved Son and he stops in whom I'm pleased to dwell in in Matthew chapter 17 he says those same words but he adds his words hear he him that's the adoption ceremony so you can see the Spirit came at the birth the baptism of Jesus and he came at the adoption ceremony and at the adoption ceremony he's saying you're the bridegroom thank Lord now this is a hidden Mystery right here to show you that Revelation 10:11 when he is telling Nations tongues and Kings to hear you what if he's telling you to prophesy again he's telling the people of the earth to hear you amen it's your adoption ceremony the adoption ceremony for the bride amen and he'll only adopt you if you're in His image and that's the image coming back to the church there Kings and Priests amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen amen praise the Lord amen that was me preaching without notes amen praise the Lord amen uh let's go to some quotes and we close amen I just want to bring in Kings and Priests and then we can see what the prophet is saying just now to nail it down amen what we've been saying amen hallelujah you love the word amen there's another uh document called Kings and Priests if we can put that up amen hallelujah it says God's intention for his creation man is to express his words in Genesis Adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed amen amen if you can get up those notes and the Believers can follow amen hallelujah have you got the document amen praise the Lord let's give the brother a minute amen then we can get into this we can hit the highlights I want you to see right now you can live as a priest and a king amen you don't have to wait for a new body the prophet is saying now he has made us Kings and Priests amen so you again the the point of this first part is just to show you how the word want you to find expression through man right you can see that God's intention of creation is to express his words that we preach that now right he simp if you go to the next quote he simply gave the word he said not to partake of knowledge partake of life life was the word of God death was anything that wasn't the word of God she allowed one word to be changed and right then Satan had her right but you can make Satan powerless before you watch how he says you can make him powerless now he says then when you can hit Satan with the scripture he's just as as powerless as he can be that is why you need to take the word into the greatest battle ever fought take the word to the Battleground right then he says all powers in Heaven and Earth is given me showing another that all power belongs to Jesus everything else is powerless he had conquered it he was quick and not only that now he's giving a promise to attach it to you now and he will send the same life that Quicken me the power that brought me from the grave I will send it upon you you to Quicken you that where I am there you will be also so you see how important the Holy Ghost is Holy Holy Ghost is going to take you to him it's your seal amen amen at your birth yes you had all these manifestations amen but the Holy Ghost is not pouring out right now for the manifestation of gifts right now he's pouring out to bring you to adoption amen yes sir you yes sir amen now he's tying in the scripture M Luke 24:49 I send the promise of the father upon you but t or waight he in the city of Jerusalem until you be endured with power from on ey brother says there dous power quickening power Amen to show that not only did he draw all the benefits out of it but he shared those benefits he shared it with you and I amen thank you Jesus he come to to redeem or to bring to life those predestinated seed that God seen before the foundation of the world and put their names in The Book of Life amen amen this is beautiful now because amen hallelujah this is beautiful because the book that we just explained that John went to take is the book that has names the lamp section of the book meaning that when you are prophesying again there in Revelation 10 8 to1 you are calling the names that are in the book the preaching of the Gospel the preaching of the end time message now is to call the rest of the names in the book yes amen yes amen you'll find it there in John chapter 11 when the shout comes to Martha she go secretly to call the rest of the names in the book she goes secretly to Mary to call Mary right because she knows the names in the book the mind of Christ is revealed to her the same with the bride now if you have the book you know the names are in the book here they are on the earth without a hope it came not only it came not only to be a blessing but to share the blessing with every predestinated seed now if that seed wasn't on the earth it could not live it had to be on the earth amen no matter how long it's kept in darkness he'll come forth when the so n shines upon it he comes to share it with us amen right let's get to Kings and Priests now this is going to be in church age book amen then we close close with this brother BR is now taking Revelation 1:6 and he says and he had made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever right he made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he hath made us amen now bear in mind Genesis 1 let us make man because the image was M he has to remake us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he bought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings amen oh we're going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits upon the throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom praise the lord we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities those are the kingdoms amen they're coming against your kingdom you say where's my kingdom your kingdom is Ephesians 1 Heavenly places you are ruling from this Kingdom of heavenly places but there's an attack upon that Kingdom we he says we Are Spiritual Kings we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom amen then he ties in Romans 5:17 by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ ties in Colossians 1:13 who are delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom he says reign of his dear son now he goes on to say very important watch now Reign now right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin amen having dominion over the world having dominion over the flesh having dominion over with the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself see what he's doing when you are doing that you are expressing him through your body amen you are showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus that's the believer's position in Christ reign with authority from that position don't let any demon power come against you amen the Bible says amen that we amen the kingdom of God suffereth violence but the violence take it by force apply some force of the word apply some force of the spirit of God lord Satan come to take your health apply some force of the word Lord it comes to take your children apply some force of the word don't allow your children to be taken captive amen human trafficking they come now for Spiritual trafficking come to hold bound your children come to hold bound your family members will you be like Abraham amen when his family member was taken what did he do he gathered some spiritual forces he gathered some Supernatural power and he went after those five Kings and their armies amen praise the Lord amen now he says and has made us priest so Kings and Priests yes priest unto him offering the spiritual Praise of Sanctified lips people can't praise the Lord but you're a priest priest must give him praise amen priest must give him praise priest doesn't M under his breath priest doesn't say he can read my mind I don't need to say a word priest offers up spiritual sacrifices fruits of your lips giving praise spending our lives as a swe offering unto him worshiping him in spirit and in truth interceding and petitioning ah amen I'm only worried about us four and no more as long as me and my family are saved why am I intercede because to intercede now must spend extra hours that belong to me to pray for someone else and how can I say eternal life is living for others interceding and petitioning priest and Kings unto our God God no wonder the world does not appeal to us and we are peculiar people zealous unto good works we have been recreated in him to be children like unto our father he recreated Us in His image and likeness amen what Satan thought he stopped in the Garden of Eden he has come back now to make us Kings and Priests back into the image of God Amen so tell your neighbor now turn to your neighbor telling the image of God is Kings and Priests Kings and priest right don't be like this man now next next qu brother it's just like a man who's got a lot of money in the bank and don't know how to write a check the next man can write a check and he got no money in the bank if you can ever get them two together that you'll have it now if you physically don't have money in your bank connect with the one that has money in his bank right he says one knows how to write the check one don't know how to write why don't you write it out write it out he says ask yeah sir anything you ask in my name right if you ever get them two together that's you'll have it if they don't realize who you are your s son and daughters of God Amen HS of the Kingdom right now we are Kings let's get it established in our hearts right now we are kings claim your legal rights amen come on Kings amen come on kings claim your legal rights Kings have a domain Kings must protect the domain claim your legal right don't let Satan press anything on you don't let him press sick on you don't let him press anxiety on you don't let him press depression upon you don't let him press sickness upon you don't let him press anything into you that word press actually means he's trying to stamp His Image upon you you're of God Amen and he has got no rights to hold it yes amen amen now that is true God called Messiahs God called us and we become Kings and Priests unto God like Jesus was God's high priest we become a lesser priest you know some people don't like this kind of preaching because you're putting too much responsibility on you people just want to come to church hear a message go home I'm going to put a responsibility on you I'm going to tell you what you are called for this hour amen hallelujah we become a lesser priest God was a fullness God in fullness dwelt in him to shine forth the expression of God to the world for God was in Christ reconciling the the world to himself and as God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself God come into his church and anoints him some sence hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah the same things he did in his church the same power he had in his church and his church becomes his Dominion amen and his King over his dominion and we are Kings and priest offering spiritual sacrifices to God the fruits of our lips giving praise to him oh oh my there you are Messiahs Messiahs little Messiahs little anointed ones anointed of what the main one anointed off the great one I don't have time to go through that other quote he says sometimes as a priest you don't feel like giving praise to him he says that's when you should do it yes the circumstance doesn't warrant you giving praise the circumstance amen is bringing your flesh body to such a condition you're feeling suppressed you can't offer a praise he says that's When You Must Praise Him in your lowest in your worst situation the Bible says let everything that has breath praise the Lord amen hallelujah Kings and Priests there is nothing shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life amen you are formed oh there are so many quotes we can go into amen hallelujah maybe we can go into one just to amen nail this down we still in our time it's 11:24 amen for those of you that are keeping time praise the Lord amen amen if we go into who is this mesic I'll just give you the paragraph and that going to be much easier for us to find it amen praise the Lord this is now what I'm saying we are moving the Revelation to an experience we're going to allow the word to have a full effect on us a king has a domain and he establishes laws and decrees that's what you must do in your life establish laws and decrees a king conquers territories fights and protects amen when there's an attack upon your kingdom yes amen don't let your attack be caral now let it be the spiritual man on the inside amen hallelujah you got who is this MDC [Music] amen let's go to uh I'm just trying to find the main quotes amen praise the Lord there's so much in this message who this mesic how many of you know you got homework to do you got to now go and read or listen to who is this mzd because mzc is your image priest and King amen hallelujah praise the Lord let's read from paragraph [Music] uh 67 now we see the attribute sons of his Spirit have not yet entered into the word form body a theophany this body is subject to the word and Earnest waiting for the earnest now the difference between him and you you see he was in the beginning the word and in morphe body he came in and lived in that in the person of mzd then later we never heard no more of mzd because he became Jesus Christ mzc was the priest but he became Jesus Christ now you pass that because in that form he knowed all things so you see why you need your theopen body in that form you will know all things and you never have been able to know that yet you came like Adam like me you came from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted now hear this church you're going through trials in your life you don't know why these things happening to you it's to mold you and shape you you came here to be tempted when this life is finished here right we have one waiting that's where we go but that is the word right let's go to the next paragraph 69 you will never become the word unless you were thought at the beginning that proves predestination right in order to stand Temptation you had to bypass the the theophany you had to become down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all the father had given me will come to me and I'll raise them at the last days right amen paragraph 70 you bypass your theophany and become flesh man to be tempted if this Earth so he repeats that when this body receives the spirit of God The Immortal Life inside of you throws this body in subjection to God right paragraph 7 73 and then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your whole being subject to that spirit and that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed word made manifest or quickened Made Alive okay and paragraph 80 says here we are formed into the word image to be partaker of the word feed on the word by being predestinated since the beginning so how are you formed into the image by being a partaker of the word feed on the word hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen 88 88 says after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food then you left the other thing you have then been formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany see amen after just before this he taking the eagle and the chicken story and he's saying now when you heard the word you heard from your theophany and your being formed into that living image of the Living God which is the king and a priest so as a king Reign on the earth as a priest offer up spiritual sacrifice as a priest remember we read there you must intercede you must make petitions let's stand together give God praise amen hallelujah hallelujah praise the Lord praise
