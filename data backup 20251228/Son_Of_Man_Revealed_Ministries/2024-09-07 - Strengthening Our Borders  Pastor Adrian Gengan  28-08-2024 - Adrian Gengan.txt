Tabernacle us Lord Jesus father this is the living Tabernacle of the most high God and Father Lord we want to empty out now father so that we can receive more of you we pray Lord that you'll wash us

Mighty hand we ask His blessings in Jesus name amen thank you Lord amen I GRE you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen isn't he worthy of Praise amen God bless you amen let's turn to our Bibles pray that you rejoicing in the Lord am amen the sub is working at enang amen he wasn't able to come to the service tonight amen praise the Lord amen little thought we speak on Hallelujah from Philippians chapter 4 and verse3 amen I want to just title it we're still on the opening up of spiritual Frontiers just want to title this exaltation amen strengthening our borders amen amen amen Hallelujah we've got to strengthen our borders amen as much as we want to advance territory we've got to strengthen our borders amen amen oh yes Lord so Philippians 4 chap uh 4:3 says I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me oh yes amen amen I can do all things through Christ which strengthen me amen you may be seated the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word amen hallelujah thank you Jesus amen so we are coming into a time and season now where we've got to be moving from Faith to perfect Faith amen amen and that's not going to be an easy thing to do if we are not taught well yes amen because there was a word released to us to bring us into perfect faith amen amen amen now a word released for 50 years 60 years and have no effect where you can see the sons and daughters in perfect Faith then something is wrong not with the word but something is wrong with the hearer of the word amen because Faith cometh by the hearing of the word so somebody is not hearing correctly amen a perfect message was sent now the message came the perfect word came in 1963 the opening of the seals which was the opening of spiritual Frontiers for us to move ahead amen amen so to strengthen our borders means to reinforce it yes to increase it to improve it amen hallelujah so the Apostle Paul is saying I can do all things through Christ which strengthened me now I like the way he starts it amen he says I can amen amen and that is you've got to have faith in what the word says about you yes you've got to have confidence in yourself thank you he says Jesus knew what the word said about him he had confidence in what the word said about him so he knew that whatever he spoke must come to pass because he's operating out of the word he's operating out of the scriptures amen amen people can be down and depressed and and maybe the care of Life coming over them but you can overcome yes Lord but you've got to say it oh yes amen amen we can't be allowing situations to get the better of us and remain in the humanistic realm when we are in the message of the hour when we are Sons and Daughters of God and then we say things of the world are weighing me down you need to have dominion over that oh thank you Lord thank you Jesus Hallelujah so you need to have dominion over the flesh you need to have dominion over your mind you need to have dominion over your thoughts amen amen even now Satan is coming we got to keep reminding the church that there are spirits hanging around to get you distracted from the service Hallelujah so I can start with I can yes amen amen you've got to have faith to be able to say you can that's right amen amen amen so faith is a positive confession amen I can wake up in the morning and say I can amen amen he's not saying lord I can't do it you know some Christians like to pray like that Lord I I can't do it lord I can't I can't is Paul saying I can't I can't is Paul saying I can't do it Christ come do it for me God didn't make you a puppet yes put you on the earth and pull strings go this way my son go this way no oh thank you Jesus God put you he called you in the end time he gave you his word so that you can come to perfect Faith he gave you his word for a reason he gave us his word for a reason the question is are we doing what we supposed to do with the word so faith is a positive confession he's not saying lord I can't oh he knows his position he's not saying Lord you come do it for me he knows that there's a law on the earth that if he puts his hand if he does a certain thing the Lord will go ahead amen and strengthen his position amen so I can means that he has confidence in what the word says about him amen hallelujah how many of you have confidence in what the word says about you is there any doubt amen there's no doubt so notice he says I can do all things yes yes amen so there is no limits there oh yes amen people have put limits people have put boundaries saying we can only go so far we can only touch certain blessings we can only do this this is our limitations certain things were only for this ministry certain things were only for that Ministry don't goast this yes who said that the crowd people around the message said it right amen but God made us to be an invincible Army God made us be able to conquer territories God made us to be able to have dominion over all situations amen hallelujah so there is no limit to what a son and daughter of God can do I say there's no limit to what you can do in Christ amen hallelujah with a positive confession you are Limitless there are untapped resources in the kingdom of God but I want you to be able to tap into those resources tap into the power of God tap into the mind of Christ amen and you can do it amen amen hallelujah we want to move ahead amen we don't just want to stay with the crowd oh this is our this is our territory we want to be like jabz enlarge my borders Lord am amen enlarge my borders I can do all things yes all things amen I say in this natural life whether you are qualified or not you can do all things through Christ amen hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen take the limitation off of your mind amen you know where the limitation is in your mind your mind is telling you you can't do it your mind is telling you you're not a son of God you're not a daughter of God it's impossible for you to do it you've got to defeat the mind the Battleground is the mind you've got to take the word to the mind yes Lord yes Lord amen hallelujah Limitless There's No Limit unlimited yeah amen praise the Lord the only limitations are what we place in front of us what other people say about us you know some people respect the opinions of others more you'll find them they're so uh what's the word I'm trying to find they are so polite everything they go to Mama Mama must tell them what to do you know they got big mama not that big mama you think here about but they got one uncle that they must go consult or they got one person they must always go consult never mind they're not in the message never mind they're not in the Christian we must go to Big Mama and ask him what he thinks about this amen but we forgetting the things of God the principles of God am amen they Place limitations on you you have a certain thing to do then they because now they are governed by their limitations because they feel they can't do it they say no I don't think that's good for you you shouldn't go and do it to this they are placing limits upon you that's right the same way the limitations the Catholic Church put limitations of the word of God but Luther said I want to extend my borders I want to go past what you are saying amen I want to read the word for myself the just shall live by faith and Then There Rose a man called lther amen Wesley who says I want to go past what Luther just said amen what the life was moving through the life couldn't be contained in the territory that it was in just in justification alone the life needed to move on and a man extended his borders and went into sanctification the second work of Grace am amen praise the Lord then we know the initial evidence the Holy Spirit was pushing out pushing out the Holy Spirit was now going to birth him the gifts of the church amen amen amen what's his name William Seymour yes a man had a desire to move past what Wesley said sanctification he had a desire and you know theza Street Revival why somebody got consecrated to the Lord and somebody had a desire to extend their borders somebody wanted to strengthen their borders amen amen and I'm telling you that it doesn't matter your reputation in the world it doesn't matter who you are God needs one man surrendered God needs one woman surrendered to him healed to him and there's no limits to what God can do with you Hallelujah you don't need to be a big name amen a big brand name amen be branded by the Holy Ghost amen I say we take some time and spend time with the Holy Ghost we spend spend time with the word we spend time in prayer and say God if you want to shake the world if you want to shake the Nations oh God here's a man who's willing oh God to pay the price for it amen amen amen these the things that are coming into the church amen the opening of the word the power that's associated with it is not going to come easy praise the Lord people think oh God's just going to give me something I'm just going to speak casually no these things come with authority these things come with adoption these things come amen when God has confidence in you and he says this is my beloved Son in whom I am pleased to dwell in so Paul is saying amen I can do all things through Christ which strengthen it me now if we focus on the last part he's telling you where strength comes from amen it is Christ that is strengthening him amen now if we ask ourselves where does strength come from we know that the joy of the Lord is our strength amen the joy of the Lord is our strength so that alone will tell you that you got to have the joy of the Lord amen amen you can't be a down person you can't be a miserable person you got to be have the joy of the Lord amen a fountain that is Flowing from within you a w spring of water that is spreading out and and watering other people amen the joy of the Lord and you are just bubbling brother BR talks about a spring a spring that just bubbling all the time and he asked spring where do you get your where do you keep getting he says something within me the joy Within Me keeps bubbling out and that's the way a Christian is am amen a Christian don't need to be charged up a Christian don't need to be cranked up amen a Christian don't need the music amen a Christian no don't need to be jumping up and down to have the joy of the Lord amen but a Christian amen from his beings shall flow forth rivers of Living Waters amen a Christian has the joy of the Lord amen amen you can't be a miserable person and be a Christian and everyone who looks at you think you're a miserable Rich that's why you like to sing amazing re Saed or Rich yes he saved you from being a rich but don't don't be a miserable rich now amen amen you ought to been bringing joy to people that's right Hallelujah you don't have to wait for father Christmas end of the year to bring joy to people had a little Joy had a little cheer people must experience joy in your presence amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord the joy of the Lord is my strength and what is joy we Define joy joy is knowing the end result oh yes Lord why you remain joyful you know the end result why that's what the Bible says for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross he knew the end result so you know your end result you know you're going to leave this world Victorious you're Overcomers of this age amen you know that you're defeating Satan and his armies you know you're going into a new body the joy that is set before you amen thank you Lord that's our strength praise the Lord amen amen oh yes Lord Revelation 3 and: 2 says Be watchful and strengthen the things which amen amen so there are many other things that maybe we were taken away from the church little by little Satan took away things from the church and I'm not talking about back in the day church history I'm talking about now after the word was restored back to the church amen he starts to take away things wants to take away Mark 16 wants to take away amen the gifts of the Spirit wants to take away things from the church brother Bram says I show you where you put it in you show me where he took it out amen amen so little by little taken away but the Lord is saying strengthen those things which remain oh yes amen amen now they gone so far they want to take the fivefold ministry out of the church Hallelujah and this is not coming from denominations yes this is coming from within the ranks of the message they want to take the fold Ministry away from the church Hallelujah yeah it says here in same chapter Revelation 3 and8 I Know Thy Works behold I've have set before thee an Open Door you see all things God God when God opens a door no man can shut he says here and no man can shut it amen amen amen so I'm telling you move ahead move ahead because God is opening every door before you thank you Lord God is opening doors before you but you know something you can't stand far even if it's an automatic door a door won't open if you stand far away if it's got automatic senses I need to walk up to that door amen hallelujah wonderful even Samson walked up to the gate and he broke that gate amen amen so walk up to your situation walk up to your circumstance walk up to the limitation of your faith I challenge you to break your the limits of your faith I challenge you to break it now yes let the roof of your faith become your ceiling and let's keep moving on praise the Lord the Lord it says here I have set before thee an open door oh Lord all the doors is shutting Lord everything I try Lord the doors are shut you then you make this your scripture you know you get the victory you know some people don't know and I'm going to teach you something here because sometimes you sit in the church and and you don't know when the pastor is saying you got to take back everything the devil stole from you and you're shouting amen but now you don't know how to really go and take back because the the Warfare is spiritual you know I suppose if you saw the devil somewhere you can go up to him and slap him around and say give me back in the natural but now you can't see in it's spiritual so the way to take back Hallelujah is the word of God to apply the word of God to find what the word says about something apply the word keep speaking the word keep holding to the word take it to the mind take it to the Battleground so when when you're finding doors that are shut when you're finding that doors won't open to you you take the scripture you memorize the scripture come on you unbeliever I'm telling you to memorize the scripture amen you want to achieve things in life yet when we are here to equip you you're looking down on what we are telling you right now amen amen that's oh thank you you're trying every other thing it's not working listen to me Revelation 3:8 you can go before every door and say Lord your word declares I have set before the an open door this door is shut before me right now but I'm going to stay here and apply this word and take back everything the devil stole from me how you going to do it by applying the word heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away you apply the word Lord you said you've set before me an open door and when you open the door no man can shut it yes amen you keep speaking that word you keep speaking that word until that door blasts open amen praise the Lord then you're going to come here and testify that's right amen yeah you're going to come here testify praise the Lord thank you Lord thank you Jesus now listen to what he says next why is the Lord opening the doors to you he says I have set before thee an Open Door no man can shut it for thou Hast little [Music] strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name praise the Lord but you've got to walk up through that door you got to go there by faith what's the scripture Revelation 3 verse 8 praise the Lord amen that's our God he strengthens us in his word amen strengthening our borders amen knowing how to apply the word knowing how to take back from the enemy knowing how to slay the enemy with the word amen amen it's no use we getting excited here in the service I went to the enemy's camp and and I took back what he stole from me we only singing a song we're only getting happy we like the beat we like the music amen took back what he stole from me but then when we go away we got nothing back amen we want spiritually strong Sons and Daughters of God amen amen hallelujah so he's saying the joy of the Lord is his strength amen Christ is strengthening me but we want to go a little deeper to see where is the strength coming from because it's not coming from your natural ability he's saying I can do all things through Christ which strengthened me but I want you to see the key there because if this presence is unrecognized you will go through your life living a defeated life that's right but I want you to strengthen yourself strengthen your border strengthen the things that remain now and we're going to build on it amen because Satan don't want you to believe what the word says yes Lord am hallelujah praise the Lord amen Paul is saying something is strengthening me Paul is saying amen there's something is drawing strength from who he says Christ is strengthening me but here's the truth of it Galatians 2:20 hallelujah amen Galatians 2 and verse 20 is the truth of the Scripture it says I am crucified with Christ this is the important part now notice he's being identified in the death of the Lord Jesus nevertheless I live not yet not I who's living in him come on who's living in you who's living in you amen Satan don't want you to believe what the word says about you but somebody is living within you giving you strength praise the Lord you mean me yes you've got to see yourself as more than a mortal remember the quotes we reading now these are not just quotes for Doctrine amen these are quotes Amen to equip you and build you up when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you become a two-fold being one of the earth and one of the spirit amen amen thank what is he saying nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me can I get somebody to make the confession Christ liveth in me amen come on now you got to believe Christ lives in you that's how Paul is getting strength yes Christ lives in you right he says yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God Amen that's a mountain moving Faith a faith that can speak to a syore tree a faith that can speak to a mountain it's not your faith anymore Christ lives in you becomes a living Tabernacle you become a power housee of the most high God and Christ is speaking through you amen amen hallelujah what is Christ you are the anointed one right amen amen see Satan don't want you to believe that Satan don't want you to amen that thank you Lord hallelujah but let's put him to a shame Christ liveth in me somebody say that Christ liveth in me amen I want you to declare the second part now because you can't depend upon your own faith he says the [Music] faith the faith faith amen so let's read from there now he says the life read this with me the life which I now live which I In the Flesh in the flesh I live I live by the Faith by the faith of the Son of God of the Son of God Amen it's no longer I that liveth but Christ liveth in me you see that's even hard for you to digest right now you know why the the biggest enemy is yourself you can't figure out the mystery of God with the human mind yes because the mystery of God is revealed yes Lord you see if I tell you in more plain language you become part of the godhead yes amen Christ liveth in you amen yes you become part of the godhead because Christ and his brighter one amen amen oh thank you Lord hallelujah amen if you don't amen this you don't miss a big part of the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed amen amen then you need to read that part of the message again to see amen that you are the the missing pieace yes amen you're not only the missing peace but you're a piece of the master yes praise the Lord thank you so Christ is living in me what is he doing brother the prophet dramatizes and he tells you how amen when he sent the Holy Ghost he sent a portion of his Spirit upon each one what is the spirit it's the spirit of Christ Christ didn't Jesus say didn't the Bible say if the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you it will also Quicken your mortal body for the gr is saying you take a from the ocean you take a teaspoon all the same chemicals that in that water in that teaspoon is in the ocean yes we were taken from his substance [Music] he went to his own self and he created and he said let us make [Music] man oh we are a part of God yes amen hallelujah so where are you drawing your strength Christ lives in me amen Christ lives in me Hallelujah stop looking for an anointed man stop looking for an anointed person you are the anointed one for the hour amen oh yes thank you Lord you are the anointed Sons and Daughters of God thank you Jesus now yes every man will have a Measure of Faith but you've got to believe in your Measure of Faith you've got to believe that you're an anointed son and daughter of God that even in the time of circumstance maybe even if you can't rise to that because there's different gifting in the body you can connect with another body of Christ oh thank you cuz if two or more shall agree upon anything it shall be done amen amen praise the Lord yes thank you Lord so strengthening our borders first how we streng strengthen our borders we strengthen the borders of our [Music] mind because where is the Battleground in the mind amen if you can't strengthen your mind with the word you'll be defeated yes these are not imaginary borders we are talking about when we are talking about the opening of spiritual Frontiers these are not imaginary Frontiers amen hallelujah but it's first got to be opened up in our mind amen can you say Amen to that praise the Lord he's worthy to be praised so we're finding where Paul is getting this because it's in the word Paul is saying I can do all things through Christ who strengthen it me so somebody will ask but where is Christ then Paul is saying Christ lives in me amen and when I speak by faith I'm speaking by the faith of the Son of God it's as good as Jesus speaking am praise the Lord so he's drawing his strength from Christ praise the Lord I'm asking you who are you drawing your strength from which Mama are you drawing your strength from which Uncle which Aunty which close friend you know some people got so close friends they can't even breathe without their friend knowing they'll found their friend I just took two breads that's how close friends they are and they don't say how many breads you took they close amen so close they are but the Bible says how can two walk together lest they be agreed yes he says tell them about the word and what you believe and see how good a friend they are to you that's right amen now if you got message Friends Christian friends people who believe like you then it's fine praise the Lord so I'm asking you where are you drawing your daily strength from daily strength strengthening our borders now we know strengthening our borders when you wake up your mind is fresh your mind is ready but what do you strengthen it will I'm asking you the question think on your life what are you strengthening it with amen if you're opening your eyes and you are thanking God and just worshiping him yes and you pray yes and you read the word yes word of God then you are strengthening your borders you're fortifying your borders but if you're opening your eyes and you are looking at whatsapp and you are looking at Facebook you're looking at Instagram you're looking at Tik Tok you're looking at some message on Snapchat the first thing you're doing you're giving that Glory first Glory first praise yeah you see the boys and girls like to Bluff one another you are always on my mind you're the first thing I think about when I wake up you're the last thing I think about in I sleep but God that what you are saying that person took first place Hallelujah yes amen so where are you drawing your strength from how are you strengthening your borders amen praise the Lord now the Apostle Paul was seeking the Lord you know he was seeking the Lord for his healing and the Lord spoke to him in the first person and the Lord tells him in 2 Corinthians 12:9 he tells him my grace is sufficient for thee but then he goes on he says for my strength is made perfect in weakness amen so Jesus is saying that his strength is perfected in you through your weakness es so don't concentrate on your weaknesses the devil will make you concentrate on your weaknesses that's how you tries to destroy your borders thank you Lord he tries to highlight your weaknesses but Jesus is Str hey give me that strength give me that weakness my strength is perfected in that weakness thank you Lord amen thank you Lord amen so what am I saying we can't rely on the flesh right we still need the Redemption of our bodies amen so we can't rely on the flesh so we can't allow Satan to beat us up based on the flesh we can't rely on ourselves on our own merits on human strengths and human ability but we've got to be able to apply the word amen yeah in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:16 how do we fortify our mind how do we strengthen our borders with the word of God notice I'm giving you scriptures tonight and we go to 1 Corinthians 26 16 because when Satan is coming to bombard you and tell you but you got this mind and you got that mind you got to speak the word of God he says amen for who had known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ that is our absolute now that is our sure Foundation that's not my word that's God's word amen you can go to the to the enemy to Satan Satan no matter what you say in 1 Corinthians 21:16 it says I have the mind of Christ amen amen and we know the prophet further details that and he says the bride has the mind of Christ and knows what he want done with the word so I'm saying let's strengthen our position and I if you know you can only strengthen your position from a high place in most battles amen it's fought in high places that's why the Bible says we wrestle not against flesh and blood spiritual wickedness in high places amen but Jesus Christ also says amen I have come to bring you up to spiritual places Heavenly places and in the Book of joh Revelation chapter 4 come up higher amen why strengthening your position amen because an elevated position can provide soldiers amen using projectile weapons over the enemy more easily such as amen if he's using arrows or pieces of artillery amen The Higher Ground is always the Vantage Point yes that's right therefore Jesus says we are seated together in Heavenly places amen why High Ground is a spot amen of elevated terrain which can be useful fighting from an elevated position is easier for a number of reasons soldiers time more quickly when they're trying to go uphill that's right I'm trying to drive a point here and show you where we are positioned so what am i showing you the bride is positioned on an elevated position and Satan is down and he's trying to ascend but we have the Vantage Point amen amen fighting from an elevated position we are in Heavenly places amen he is trying to move up hill that's why he says I want to go to the sides of the North amen hallelujah and when you are going up here you can't move as fast you're tired and when if you know if you're fighting up here like this you can't see the the who you're trying to attack because the one in front of you is blocking you so your view is obstructed everybody agree amen amen therefore we sing that song Lord plant my feet on High Ground lift me up let me stand now that's why we come to now Psalm 24 who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord who shall get the Vantage Point who shall get the vantage point in the battle who shall Ascend Mount Zion Mount Zion is the showdown in the sour Mount Zion is you and I yes we are the final showdown yes praise the Lord Psalm 24:3 says who shall Ascend into the hill of the Lord who shall stand in his holy place so who's going to go to this High terrain of the battle and strengthen our borders there's a people selected and called for this and the Bible says here he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart that is speaking about consecration yes that is speaking about a consecrated life that is speaking about a hidden life the one that's going to go to the elevated position to strengthen our borders is the one with a con iated life the one with a prayer life Clean Hands the priest had to clean his hands and he had to have a pure heart aren't we priests and Kings amen he says who has not lifted up his soul unto vanity nor sworn de deceitfully watch now this man he shall receive the blessing from the Lord and righteousness from God of his salvation how do we strengthen our defenses then we've got to ascend the hill of the Lord is it why we took Psalm 24 this year we shall Ascend the hill of the lord we sing that song out of Zion's Hill salvation comes amen praise the Lord you among Zion amen you are here for the final showdown praise the Lord so we are here to receive the blessing of the Lord we find in 1 Kings chapter 20 we know that the the the prophet came to the king of Israel and said unto him this is now in 1 Kings 20:22 the prophet comes to the king of Israel and said unto him go strengthen thyself they had just fought a battle they just fought a battle on the hills and they won the battle they defeated their [Music] army he says go strengthen thyself and Mark and see what thou doest for at the return of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee so I'm telling you at every high place at every Victory don't think that this adversary the devil is going to back down that's right like the king the prophet is telling the king go strengthen yourself and see what thou doest what he's telling go strengthen your position and take note of what you must do next yes and we coming week after week like that yes strengthen our position come to get amen battle plans battle amen attack plans we strengthen our position he says for next year the king of Syria will come up against thee I'm telling you amen that Satan is not going to let you go Satan's always going to come up against you amen you are the people that he wants the most you are the sides of the north that he wants to sit upon praise the Lord you see Satan knows if he got Eve he got the kingdom Satan knows if he gets you the Bride of the Lord Jesus he's got Jesus so he wants to sit on the sides of the north but the prophecy is you want to sit on my queen you want to sit on my hill you want to sit on my elevated position he says you'll be brought down to the sides of the pit [Music] that's a prophecy over him amen so the the prophet is telling the king go strengthen your position I'm asking you strengthen your position strengthen your borders take note of what we must do in this hour is what the word is saying here this is from the Bible now go strengthen your position take note of what you must do for the king of of Persia the King of the North is going to come up against you Satan and his arm is 200 million demons or you may be thinking they they're going there and they attacking the denominations they're going there and they're attacking the Catholics they're going there and they're attacking amen whoever they want no they are here for your to come up against you Sons and Daughters of God you know what they told them they sent out a challenge and he says Ah they God are the gods of the Hill therefore they are stronger than us let us fight them in the valley in the plane surely we shall be stronger than they you see how he brings sickness upon us he wants to fight Us in the valley yeah he says I don't bring all your army he says number the an army he says bring your captains bring horse for horse Chariot for chariots what he's telling him is we know we are no match for you but bring an equal amount of Chariots horses as us and let's fight in the valley let's fight in your Low Places you don't know that we are like job we can fight in Low Places too in the midst of death we can say the lord giveth and the lord taketh away blessed be the name of the Lord L amen praise the Lord so they go and fight in the Low Places but they didn't know that these people were walking under a prophetic anointing hallelujah amen they didn't know ye though I walk through the valley yes of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me amen praise the Lord thy rod and thy staff they comfort me how God is a god of the hills and the Low Places no matter if Satan tries to bring you low Satan tries to pull you down you fight him thank you amen so fighting from an elevated position like we said is easier holding the higher ground or offers us the vantage point so let us stay in Heavenly places what I'm trying to tell you amen let's not come down to the things of the earth amen it gives us a wide view of the field it gives us amen it can we can survey you know the Watchtower is up on the he up on the tower The Watchmen now in closing I'm going to say this because you want to strengthen yourself but strength comes from food right how do you strengthen yourself you get it from food we eat in the natural so therefore if we want to strengthen ourselves spiritually strengthen ourselves our borders spiritually we've got to eat the right diet the right food so yeah the prophet of God is saying talking about the Good Samaritan he says when the Good Samaritan come by he poured oil into the wound right he says he took you and he wants you to get into one of those hins that are closest to you watch how he tells us now he says he's done paid the pastor to take care of you so he's paid he's received the Holy Ghost got the blessings of God and health and Revelation he can just feed your soul yes so you can come now and join one of the churches it'll be the best thing you can do to keep your spirit fed and moving on praise the Lord now if you want to go according to God's provided way then you got to follow this so somebody's going to feed your soul you're drawing strength from somewhere praise the Lord amen he says here you've got to have confidence in a man you're dealing with or it won't do you any good to do any dealing you got to believe your your pastor he's a God saved man preaching the gospel stand behind him with everything you've got if he isn't go somewhere where they can where they do it so he's not saying you must be without a pastor he's saying if he isn't go somewhere where you can get somebody right he says now that clears it up for both sides remember if he preaches the gospel stay with him cuz he's a man saying sent from God ordained to feed your soul yes that's the main thing now because we want to strength ourselves what you're being fed then he says they have pastors to feed you and Shepherd you until Jesus comes they the care take at the end Jesus give them two pence talking about the Samaritan still now he says he gave the pastor two pence word and spirit if they need anything more he will give it when he returns you know the parable of the Good Samaritan amen so we know that faith if we want to strengthen ourselves Faith strengthens us amen Faith actually fast tracks you to the promise of God the more faith you have you fast track the promises of God in your life Faith actually activates the promises of God in your life the way to enlarge yourself and fill out is to be full of Faith amen you know if you want to fill a container you can't f it halfway for if you want it to expand how many if you follow what I'm saying like Enoch he reached Faith levels that were so great that this world his body couldn't contain him he had to enlarge and push out into a new body amen you can get so full of the Holy Ghost so full of the power of God so full of the anointing but the thing is do we want it or is it just something that somebody else is Desiring amen do you know in a car faith is the accelerator faith is the accelerator if you want to go faster you got to push the accelerator and what is the fuel the word is the fuel because faith comes by the hearing of the word so if You' got enough fuel in your tank you don't have to be afraid to push the accelerator you don't have to worry about if you've got enough fuel in your tank you've got the word of God Amen so we can accelerate yes what they call it pedal to the metal foot down because we've got the backing of the word don't be afraid to accelerate yes amen fear and worry are killers of Dreams fear and worry kills your dreams and slows down the journey remember the children of Israel what did it doubt fear depletes hinders their faith and rips you robs you of the blessing and your position you already hold in the ever heavely realm I'm telling you you are in Heavenly places don't be pulled down Eve got pulled out from Heavenly placesall amen hallelujah they are things that will destroy your vision they're called Vision destroyers these are attack weapons of the enemy Satan has Faith Killers Satan has doubt missiles Satan has fear Rockets fiery darts of the enemy they are called DS of

position those things weaken your position speaking I can't do it I'm not good enough I can't make it my Fai is weak maybe I'm not C amen maybe making excuses I'll first quit this then I'll do that for God don't wait while God is moving you move on to faith if Faith levels are low amen if your faith is weak and your levels are low all you need is a Mustard Seed Faith and move out amen push out
