Earth even as it is in heaven we pray Lord that you come now and speak to us through you your precious word Lord we are preaching out of our open book oh God the Bible made a life to us the Lord become under the revelation of the hour oh God and we know father we are not called unaware's father Yes but you have clearly identified the time this season the hour that we are living in Father we pray Lord even as we look into your word this morning that you would come and bless us father and I pray Lord that you'll bless the hero of the word may to catch the revelation of the word oh God and Lord apply it to our lives oh God that we can Lord live victoriously oh God we pray in our father for the sick The Afflicted Lord all those that have needs oh God I pray Lord that they will believe oh God yes through the teaching of the word or why the word is What is love we can know God to receive it oh God whatsoever they desire we ask his Blessings Now in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen everybody feeling good amen greet somebody welcome them in the house of the Lord amen and you can attach a little smile to it amen Hallelujah I'm sure they'll appreciate it amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord amen okay we can go to the notes we'll start reading amen hallelujah what a blessed Easter convention we had amen amen everybody paying attention you know the angel of the Lord is very distracted easily the prophet says there shouldn't be children running around he said there shouldn't be any irreverence with the music so we're approaching the sacred time now amen he says everything should be in order I was reading there somebody took a photograph and the prophet said stop that he says that light is affecting me because the angel of the Lord is also a light amen remember where we come now we haven't just gathered if you want a normal Church Gathering plenty of churches around but we know the angel of the Lord is here amen so we want to reference him and make him feel welcome in our midst amen hallelujah so this morning we'll speak amen 2023 we know that's the year we end right but our focus is moving to manifesting the revelation of the hour no longer preaching the word as a prophecy that the bride will be this will be this will be this hallelujah amen if we continue preaching like that please take me into the time where it will be I need a time machine and take me to that time amen but we want to live in the Supernatural in the now amen yes and we want to manifest the revelation of the hour now yes yes amen otherwise like I say many times let us go to the grave and let the generation that's going to fulfill that scriptures come on on the scene now we see everything is fixing now remember the angel of the Lord is fixing things yes getting us ready for the coming of the Lord now he's fixing everything and he's fixing your life as well okay amen so let's read our scripture then you can be seated so we'll be speaking on manifesting the revelation of the hour amen the scriptures must become alive in you and me we'll start by reading revelation 10. amen verse 8 so this part of the prophecy applies to us applies to you amen we can Rejoice around 10 7 because 10 7 brought us the revelation of the word but unless 10 8 to 11 becomes alive in us we will not be fulfilling our part of the prophecy so 10 8 says and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the end of the angel with standard upon the sea and upon the Earth so if the book is open the onlooker can read the book yes and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it eat it up and it shall be make thy belly bitter and it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey so we have sweet mouths and bitter bellies when we take this book 10 10 says and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my hand sweet as Annie and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen may the Lord a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated did we get anything sorted in terms of sound to be tried let's play a song or something Amen in the background like an instrumental soul I can go ahead and I just need to make sure you have sound connected amen so we know Revelation 10 verse 8 to 11. has been fulfilled since the time the prophet went off the scene Believers caught the Revelation and they started to prophesy again they started to take the message amen remember this is not a fresh revelation we are bringing they already did it whether they knew it or not they were prophesying again they took the message around the world amen amen and the message began to strike the seed because the message is a light amen the message began to strike the sea predestinated seed that was laying where you were maybe in your denomination maybe in your temple maybe amen wherever you were but when the light struck the seed in you you start to germinate your life amen so 2023 we know this is not the year to play Church it's the 117th year of the church age amen and even if you knew Jesus was coming in the 117th year what are you doing to make preparation it can't be business as usual right yeah so the year is not to play Church you become continue as normal it's time to change amen it's a new season and if you cannot cope with the power of the new season you die out in the whole season a seed has got to recognize the season it is in you know there are certain seeds on the earth that you can only plant in certain season otherwise you don't ever come to life amen if you buy these little seeds you'll see in the back of it they tell you which season to plant that seeding right amen so if you think about just take this type now there was the time the season of the law and the season of Grace those under the old system of the Lord died spiritually because they did not catch the season that was they were in and they had to step into the new season which was the New Testament they were stepping out from law into Grace so as climate and nature changes with each season you have to awaken to the changing season in the body of Christ amen God has already started a new thing there's too much evidence in the last three months for us to be making this up and for us for it to be a figment of our imagination and whilst many have awakened to what the Lord is doing in our life stamp some still need to catch it and I agree you catching this morning amen we don't want to live not be I yeah amen I think it's working amen so this is the year what is the year 23 23 in the Bible also has to deal with death a lot of scriptures deal with death but 23 spiritually die to self isn't that what we've been doing this year dying to self amen amen amen this is not about me this is not about some Minister amen this is about equipping the body of Christ fast collectively coming together empowering the body amen you shall see a performance of the opening of the word amen Hallelujah do you know where I'm getting that from when Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word the angel said You shall see your performance amen amen amen amen when you're receiving the word now you shall see a performance manifested in your life amen so this is the year to die to self amen hallelujah allow the Holy Spirit to fill you remember if you're too much of ourselves the Holy Spirit can't fill us we need to empty out so he can fill us not just fill us now we want to overflow yeah amen so that we can affect others others can drink amen so we want to live in that overflow Amen Let the Holy Spirit anoint you and govern your life amen say death to the carnal nature and awaken the spirit man Quicken the spirit man anoint the spirit man with the Holy Spirit amen you know why people don't want to submit to the Holy Spirit they're enjoying life too much amen because when the Holy Spirit possesses you he governs your life my son don't want to give to that surrender some saying no I don't want to be spiritual I don't want to be holy I just want to you know come to church and I just want to sit there quietly and nobody must trouble me that's not what you're called to manifest amen your call for much more than that so what you're going to find now you're going to find this the flesh is going to resist the flesh is going to resist when you forsake the things of the world and all your fleshly desires your body your flesh is going to have withdrawal symptoms you know what happens to an addict when they're trying to recover they start to have withdrawal symptoms amen but don't give in to the desires of the flesh don't give in to the pressures of the flesh amen don't have a relapse press through and diet yourself I mean if you're with me amen say Lord I'm willing to die amen if he takes everything let it die amen let this be the year that King Jesus ruled and Reigns over your life amen don't only want him to be your savior but let him be king let him be Lord over your life Hallelujah amen now very quickly I'm going to tell you this that Malachi for prophet came to turn our hearts back to the faith of the fathers so we have a message that would have given us the correct interpretation of scripture right amen and reveal the Hidden Mysteries like the sealed trumpets Wilds future home this is what we call the opening of the word yes amen so this is the opening of the word is what was called the third pool of brother branham's Ministry amen and all of that was given to produce a final result we got to look for the result of it the result is that a people there'll be a people and there is a people I'm talking to whose hearts are turned back to the original faith and would also operate in the power and the anointing of the original Pentecostal fathers not just have a revelation of the word but the word produces faith faith cometh by the hearing of the word and under the third pool opening of the word produces perfect fate thank you amen so same sign same wonders same manifestation making Jesus Christ Hebrews 13 8. amen so if the open word is not turning our hearts back to the faith and producing the same results we see in the book of Acts then there's a big question mark over your head the opening of the word is not materialized in you amen it does not become real in you so what do we have professors you know what professors is we are professing we have the opening of the world we become professors but we are not producing amen so there is a problem there your engine is not starting you need Dynamics to give you some life in your engine amen hallelujah so we want the Holy Spirit to be in our midst right the angel of the Lord the holy spirit amen let's go to a slide in amen first slide so we read Matthew 18 and 20. he okay and we see here the Bible says where two or three are gathered together in my name what's his name amen the revelation of his name is the Lord Jesus Christ amen he says there I am in the midst of them yes now if you can't see it there there's something blatant in there if you go to the next slide maybe we'll highlight it a bit for you where two or three are gathered together in my name imagine amen amen okay you'll catch it now some some CPUs are slow you know we work with Windows 7 and then we got Windows 10 and now we got Windows 11. amen then we also got the operating systems amen so some have core I3 some have Core i5 and some have called i7 so we're letting all the CPUs catch up amen so he says where two or three are gathered together in my name there I'm in the midst of them in 23 are we gathered in his name yeah then he's shooting our midst no doubt amen hallelujah amen hallelujah let him be king of your life this morning now we go to the next line and we see you on mantra's figuration what do we see amen we see Moses in Elijah and we see Peter James and John go to the next slide amen what do we see here two from heaven and three from the Earth yeah come on gpus work work work amen Moses and Elijah and who's in the midst of them where two or three are gathered he is in the midst you can't make the scriptures live [Applause] I'm not making this up I'm not picking this up amen it's there in the world there's two from heaven and there's three from the Earth so two or three are gathered together in his name and he is there in the midst amen hallelujah so in 2023 you can go amen further now this is the year that the Lord is appearing in the midst of you you gotta believe it amen awakened to it sometimes you gotta pinch yourself because you say Lord is this really happening am I imagining these things you know the prophet in some of your Supernatural experiences they had to pinch himself you have to bite his hand because it was so Supernatural he wondered if you were seeing a vision but 2023 this is the year the Lord is appearing in the midst of you amen amen amen hallelujah now we just read Revelation 10 right but in order to understand Revelation 10 progress problem Revelation 10 goes together with the Revelation 11 13. Revelation 10 and Revelation 13 goes together some of you CPUs are very fast there amen events taking place in Revelation 10 keeps the bride from being deceived by the events in Revelation 13. are you with me amen amen you got to know those two scriptures now you got to know what's happening in Revelation 10 you got to know what's happening in Revelation 13 very quickly for those of you don't know Revelation 13 there's two beasts and there's the image unto the Beast being raised up and it's deceiving the old world to worship the image of the Beast right and who is the ones that worship Him all the ones that do not have the names in the little book we just spoke about in Revelation 10. so that's what Revelation 13 is about Revelation 10 is now the mighty angel coming down with a book from heaven and it's the title deed to man's inheritance amen amen so what is it Revelation 10 we can say is the intelligence report in this battle so in any War the intelligence report is very important to fight the war and to defeat the enemy yes you know it was a fault based on the intelligence they received so the bride is receiving her intelligence report from heaven amen thank you Lord amen so we go to the next slide we see this is where we're going to focus now Revelation 13 and 8 it says all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him who is that Satan become incarnate and he's worshiped as the God of this Earth now who's worshiping him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world amen that's where we get the scripture now the Lamb of slain from before the foundation of the world right so if you caught it the book that is coming down as names and you have to see your name in the book so that you won't worship the Beast amen amen so the intelligence report the bride is receiving is the Lamb's Book of Life and she is seeing her name in the book that's not just a statement now amen I don't know if you're following me yes yes amen this is the seven seal book the seals amen the opening of the seals revealed more than just the symbols more than just the Riders amen that's the hidden part you have to catch the intelligence report the bride is receiving the Lamb's Book of Life and she's seeing a name in the book you see when people are not quick and they haven't seen the name in the book amen hallelujah so that's what's keeping you from being deceived seeing your name in the Lamb's Book of Life that your name is in the family album amen hallelujah so that's the purpose and the power of the seals because beneath its seal our names and you must see your name beneath the seals the seals are not just revealing symbols and telling you about horse riders how many of you have faith when you know a the White House writer is doing this and the red horse rider is doing that that's only uncovering the devil's schemes uncovering his battle plan but you have got to see yourself as part of redemption's plan amen the revealing of your name took away your amnesia and when you see your name in the book it revealed that you have a theory from your body waiting and this is what is producing rapturing faith in you amen amen ask yourself in the message of Yahweh everything you know about it what is giving you rapturing faith if there's nothing there giving you rapturing Faith then the seals have not opened the Sanders have not opened to you because he says it will take that seven times to awaken her again what is awakened amen now just to go to a quote to show you I'm not making this up that you need to see your name you're in the second seal the property is saying in the closing prayer he says I'm one of those that's going to find my name tonight behind that seal Yonder you see what he's waiting for the people to catch he says I'm one of those that's going to find my name tonight behind that seal Yonder that was put on there from the foundation of the world something struck my heart and I'm standing Lord is it me are you calling me can't you hear your theophany calling you amen he says he goes on to say I want you to reveal to me my name over there fill me and seal me to yourself by the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen so what does the message come to do it comes to connect you to your theophany yes it comes to identify that you have a fear of in your body amen amen hear what he says now then after you recognize the very word of God was Eagle food notice the succession what he's talking about after you recognize that the word of God the message of the hour is Eagle food then you left the other thing then being formed into the living image of the Living God you heard from your theophany amen so the message comes to make you hear from your theophany amen tells you that you have representation that you have another body waiting for you so don't fear death amen that is not what they can do to the body we have another body waiting you know First Corinthians 15 says that we have one already waiting so yeah and the next one he says the bride hasn't had a Revival yet there's been no Revival there now pay attention to this no manifestation of God the bride no manifestation of God what produces the manifestation it says to stir the bride yet see we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back there to wake her up again or somebody say Wake Me Up Lord amen say sorry somebody say Wake Me Up Lord say Lord manifest yourself because that's the two important elements in the scripture in this quote we need a manifestation of God and we need to be awake so just to Define that quote what is the manifestation of God to stir the bride the Dynamics the Holy Ghost amen the Dynamics will produce the manifestation amen it'll take those seven unknown pandas to wake up again what is that to waking up again means to take away your nesia like the eagle that was in the chicken ten was awakened took away the Amnesia yes you say no it can't be that simple God in simplicity I'm waiting for some mysterious Revelation on the seventh unders God in simplicity awaken you you are a part of God yes I still see I'm not catching it and not only are they not catching it they're not excited about it that's a problem that's a problem right there if you're not excited that your name is found in the book that you have salvation that you have representation from before the foundation of the world that it's nothing you have done but God has already predestinated your life amen you just have to awaken in the hour and manifest your part of the scripture awaken means to take away your amnesia you once walked in light you won't tell the truth but then you came into this world and it's hidden seed and you got blinded you got amnesia but now the Lord has sent forth the opening of the world to take away your nation amen amen so that's why the prophet keeps using that type of the eagle and the chicken when the Eagle's Amnesia got taken away he had to leave the chicken pen he had to sow into the heavenlies amen oh Hallelujah I know some of you want me to tickle your ears with some mighty Revelation on the seventh hundreds you know what they told the prophet oh it'll be some great Revelation Lord prophet he says no it'll be something you can't be something out of the word it'll already be something in the world he says because Revelation says you can't add to the book and you can't take away amen amen hallelujah you remember the time he preaches message and his one brother was so enthused he said that could be the 23rd chapter of Revelation amen Hallelujah now let's go back to this Revelation 10 and revelation 13. see if you can pick up your CPUs work there's two beasts in Revelation Tim deceiving the inhabitants of the earth and causing them to worship the image of the Beast but in Revelation amen so that's sorry two peace in Revelation 10 right deceiving but in I should have said it the other way Ashley typo error two beats in Revelation 13 you can fix it there if you want two peace in Revelation 13 deceiving the inhabitants of the Earth causing them to worship the image of the Beast but in Revelation 10 there are three opposing forces can you see the two and the three there again oh Hallelujah two in Revelation 13 3 in Revelation 10 who's the three the mighty angel from heaven the seventh angel William Branham and Sean the bride you amen amen Hallelujah amen oh bless the name of Jesus amen amen he's worthy to be praised now just to reiterate I'm going to say this again your Nisha is taken away when you see your name in the family album the little pook which is the Lamb's Book of Life so where did you see it beneath the seal beneath the seal you'll find your name you've got to ask yourself which seal you'll find your name amen Hallelujah so for those of you CPUs were really slow let's define this maybe we'll do some math so Revelation 10 plus Revelation 11 mathematically gives you what are we making this up why is it there why are these two conflicting forces that come down for the final battle on the Earth going with this number amen 10 plus 13 Revelation 10 plus Revelation 13 equals amen so what is it happening the battle is on for you you say for me yes Heaven wants you and hell wants you both are fighting for you ask yourself to whom will you surrender amen amen ask yourself to whom will you surrender amen now if it if the if it's focused on you then you're a three-part being right everybody agree you're a three-part being now filled with the Holy Spirit making you a supernatural being so you got Body Soul spirit and now you have the Holy Spirit okay but your body was formed in the womb of your mother anybody was formed outside the home I need you to say Amen so you understand what I'm saying your body was formed in the womb of your mother it took cells from your mother and it took cells from your father coming together in order to form the body who did biology in school let me see your hands quickly I don't know what they call it these days now this is going to blow your mind in the humans each cell contains 23 pairs of chromosomes it takes 23 chromosomes from the father 23 from the mother together forming a total of 46 Hallelujah oh Hallelujah somebody praise God please amen hallelujah amen he's worth it we praise amen amen I know you're catching it I'm just letting you digest it you know sometimes when you chew a steak you gotta chew quickly amen and when it's really good because what is Psalm 46 God is our refuge and our strength we're not making this up now it's there mathematically because God is a God is the one who created maths 23 23. amen what does it say in Psalm 46 I just thought of this now so I'm finding it yeah 46 and verse 5. so Psalm 46 is 23 and 23 Psalm 46 that's what made me think of Psalm 46 right now but we also said that in the midst of two or three uh in presence of two or three Gathering his name is in the midst what is Psalm 46 verse 5 watch how the spirit will connect us now you're watching the operation of the spirit right now God is in the midst of her in psalm 46. hallelujah amen God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved amen God shall help her and write early amen hallelujah so there's 23 chromosomes amen and the 23rd pair of chromosomes are known as the six chromosomes because they decide if you'll be both be male and female not both now if you will be born male or female what determines it the 23rd pair is this coincidence no it's not coincidence amen you know that there's X and Y chromosomes right right but the 23rd pair determines whether you are male or female and what is the struggle on the earth now gender neutral right they don't want the 23rd chromosome that came first right now amen they don't want the 25th chromosome it's an agenda they are driving on the earth gender neutral don't tell the child whether it's male or female when they grow up let them decide yeah yeah they don't want the 23rd elements amen hallelujah because they know amen hallelujah so then after I told you a three-part being but the after your body if they can if they can corrupt the body make you lose your identity amen what will it do your spirit can never be quickened your soul will be bound if they corrupt the body the 23 or 23 chromosomes your soul is bound but if God has come to set you free healing the son of man is set free is free indeed this morning amen it's come to liberate you come to give you your identity amen hallelujah amen oh is worthy to be praised amen here the prophet says now he says the reason I do believe that when the bride is called out and elected and set in The Book of Life are we talking about the Book of Life are we talking about seeing your name in the book how you saw your name the seals were opened he says what will come now this is where we type into a manifestation now he says there come a sound from Heaven that will take such a baptism of the Holy Spirit into that bride that will take up from the earth in a rupture increase I believe the season has opened up now amen what she doesn't say the holy spirit will come he says he'll take such a baptism it'll take such a baptism amen of the Holy Spirit into that bride that will take her from the earth in a rapturing Grace and no this is the quote we're driving all the time this year the Dynamics this is found in what shall I do with Jesus called Christ paragraph 116 he says the Dynamics of this church will be a refilling of the Holy Spirit refill Me Lord that's what we ought to be saying right there refill me Lord that's the Dynamics of the church refill Me Lord amen that we have words now watch what he's saying time is ministering up he's saying now was it a small thing what was happening in in the prophet's Ministry no right we wouldn't call it a small measure but what did he say he's saying that we have worked in a small measure while The Headstone is coming down to unite with the body so if it was so great while it was coming down to your night what will it be when it's United It's uniting Time and Time amen quick into a church amen amen he doesn't stop Jesus but when the head and body unites together the full power of the Holy Ghost would raise her up amen hallelujah it says when the full power of the Holy Ghost amen say Lord give me the full power amen now watch what he does a truthful thing it raises her up that's the shout and even the death amen America the Holy Ghost in you why there's nothing else no more scriptures to be fulfilled amen it's got to make a quickening power in you that these ugly actions cannot contain your body you've got to change Dimensions amen quickening power is in you that it will also amen cause the manifestation and cause the next part of the prophecy to come to pass which is amen the resurrection of the sleeping Saints he says the full power of the Holy Ghost amen would raise up just exactly like that even the dead that's dead in Christ for hundreds of years ago will rise in the beauty of his Holiness and take a flight to the skies both you living and both the dead Resurrection take your flight to the skies and here you reiterate the Dynamics is the Holy Spirit amen hallelujah now you say oh brother I missed the first season I missed the first three months 2023 January to March we're going to reset the clock for you you said you have the power amen do you have the power well Joshua spoke to the son all things are possible to them that believe amen I was telling you so a few weeks ago that we are in the 11th Hour remember we are the 11th Hour Gentile workers and on the plug isn't that the 23rd hour on the clock there's 24 hours in the day but 11 pm it's the 23rd hour so in the 23rd hour he's pouring out the Dynamics he's pouring out the fullness of the Holy Ghost In You amen so you got to go to this next one now so according to the Jew to the Hebrew calendar their first month of the year is Nissan and it doesn't start in January so there are two calendars right that people when in fact China's got their own calendar and different people of the earth got their own calendar you know about the Chinese New Year the Jews have their own New Year and we have our new year because we are following the solo calendar but the Jews Hebrews followed the lunar calendar you'll find even the Muslims who's a impersonation of the Jews follow the lunar calendar right so Nissan is the first month and it coincides with March in April in our calendar now in there in Israel it's spring you know Lambs are gone in springtime amen I'm going somewhere with this but catch it so the Hebrew New Year starts in the month of Nissan which is called a bit and this year the Hebrew New Year is five seven eight three amen amen but they are following this not because they decided that they want to follow this calendar God told them when the new year will be amen amen so they followed in lunar calendar and it's determined by the moon but God is the one who told him when it would be the first man and you'll find that in Exodus 12 verse 2. Exodus 12 verse 2 let's go to the slide it says and the Lord's begun to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt saying this month shall be unto you the beginning of months amen amen and it shall be the first month of the year to you so God determined when the first month of the year would be amen watch now Exodus 12 is very prophetic because it's speaking about the Passover Lamb so what are we establishing that the New Years just started according to the Hebrew calendar right what did it say there you can go and read it that is between March and April the first month right so verse 3 says speak the answer to the congregation of Israel saying in the 10th day of this month they shall take every manly lamb so there's the lamb according to the house of the father is a lamp for an house right now your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year and you shall take it out from your sheep or from your goats and you shall keep it up until the 14th day of the same month okay and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening so when was the lamb slain on the 14th the first time it was slain in Egypt on the 14th day of Nisan amen now in the first Exodus on the 14th day of Lisa and they killed the lamb applied the blood the dead Angel passed through the land and they left Egypt everybody agreed Amen in the second Exodus on the 14th day of Nissan they killed the Lamb of God Amen amen and all who apply the blood can leave the law and enter into Grace the first Exodus was the type of the second Exodus now we in the third so in the Third Exodus after seven Church ages the true word is rejected the word is crucified but the token life which is the blood type of the blood the Holy Ghost comes upon the believer and we are preparing to leave the Earth to go to heaven amen so it these are some of the things that happen now quickly I'm going to tell you it was in the month of Nisa and that God spoke to Moses in the burning bush it was in the month of Nissan that Joshua enters the Promised Land then take over Jericho and sit a predestinated sea called Raya free nehemiah's commissioned in the month of Nishan to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem Nehemiah 2 verse 1 it came to pass in the month of Nisan in the 20th year of artist Xerxes the king that wine was before him and I took up the wine and gave it unto the king sometimes people need to be stimulated with Revelation that's why Nehemiah is giving the king some stimulation of Revelation but watch the timing and the season he's doing it in the new year way is there in that Kingdom it's not the new year but according to God's calendar it's the new year amen and something triggers in the month of Nisan to go and take some stimulation of Revelation and give it to the king now I have not been Before Time sad in his presence amen now we don't want to go into that right now but I want to go to a quote where the Prophet is saying you'll find this in the 70th week of Daniel paragraph 64. he says now the going forth of the Commandment to rebuild Jerusalem which was on the 14th day of March if any one of you want to put that down in the Hebrew you'll find it called Nissan Nissan means much the issue was given on the 14th day of March 4 45 the issue went for to build rebuild the Temple you understand it as people have read the scriptures everybody understand it was also in the month of Nissan that essays to come into a full position and Eamonn is killed and the Jews are saved from a Mass Slaughter amen Jesus was born in the month of Nisa Jesus was killed in the month of Nisa and Jesus rose again in the month of Nisan man do you know the Jews believe that their Deliverance will come in the month of Nissan now you're saying oh brother why are you labeling the point amen why are you laboring the point you're getting excited about that you know the prophet says one time there was a man was he excited about the word of God and he the daughter was having a tea party yeah and she says Dad I'm having my friend come over but I don't want you to make noise I'm going to put you up in the antique and I'm going to keep this geography book and you read that book there and we're just going to have a tea part here and when we finish we'll call you down so they're busy with the Tea Party the father is reading the geography book and all of a sudden they hear a shot of Hallelujah praise the Lord and there's jumping up and down you know some Pentecostal people two Pentecostals can't keep the fire down or she goes up there and said dad did not tell you to be quiet I gave you a joke if you put what are you so excited about you're not even reading the Bible he says oh I'm reading near her in the in this uh in this geography book and they're telling me there's a place that they can't find the bottom of the ocean and Jesus says he took my sins and he casted it says this must be the place now if you can see these types of Shadows and we are in the season right now amen then what is it now if you go to Google when did Nissan start let's go to the next slide next slide next one go so when does Nissan begin if you Google that no no some CPUs didn't catch it yet when did Nissan starts somebody said 23rd of March coincidence let's go back a slide back one so you know five plus seven plus eight plus three gives you 23 right so it's the year in fact it only works from 2020. because Exodus 23 verse 20 starts from 20. 223 talking about the angel of the Lord I hope you catch it people amen I wish I could download the Revelation into you but from 2020 what has happened so go read Exodus 23 verse 20 to 23. we're in the 23rd year and in the 20th years before I send my angel before thee and he's going to drive out all of these people right so it's the Hebrew New Year 23 but also in the solar calendar it's also the year 23. in the second Millennium after Jesus follow me a millennium is a thousand years the second two thousand years after Jesus 23 years after the second Millennium is where we stand today and why in this year the proclamation Goes Forth you shall see the angel of the Lord this shall be the most Supernatural here for the church you were here in all the meetings amen this shall be the most Supernatural year for the church amen hallelujah now if we go back to slide 49 there's also something that tied to you and me here I don't know what inspired brother Joshua to do this it wasn't me now so while I'm reading this and I was so excited and I'm reading that 23rd March started this Nissan everybody caught that that this year 23rd March started the new year then the spirit tells me go see when Nissan started in 2021 and I was shocked it like blew the socks off of me because these things were not planned this was divinely orchestrated Amen brother Joshua chose the date we got brother Becca to come you can see there it's confirming yeah and on this coming Sunday March 14 2021 we will welcome what is perhaps the most important month in the Hebrew calendar which is Nissan what happened on 14 March I'm just showing you how God can tie things together supernaturally amen so what was that new season amen a new season being Bliss amen what is it wasn't it a new season amen when Joshua had to take the people into the promised land what was nehemiah's Commission on the same date did we not read the prophet go back two quotes back to that quote 14 March did we not read here where he says 14th March rebuild the walls of Jerusalem amen the message walls have been torn down but the people raising up to rebuild the walls Nehemiah didn't build it alone this is not a one-man Ministry the people rose up with Nehemiah so read Nehemiah the Common People amen were empowered to rebuild the walls amen they came against opposition and persecution they had to rebuild the walls the Bible says in trouble sometimes if there's ever more trouble sometime than now then you tell me we're rebuilding during Troublesome time I'm not making anything to that I just thought I'll show you that because it was very significant that Nissan first of Nissan in 2021 was the 14th of March you will ask for the Joshua why he chose a date amen and he wants he can't tell you that he studied all of these things and he saw it was a prophetic date and you know all of these things brother Joshua won't lie to you amen so I want you to hear what the prophet is saying now in this quote I want you to get built up now in this holy Oracles of God what is it the revelation of the hour what message is he preaching this spiritual food in due season so he's telling you all of these things I'm feeding you because Faith cometh by the hearing of the word right so he said I'm storing up the food I want you to get built up on the holy Oracles of God in the faith the faith of this hour amen it's going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith be taken up amen hallelujah and that's where I want to stop I don't want to give you too much to digest I want you to eat in small portions but you're still going to play something now for you because we are watching the angel of God Speak in a way in almost every service that it sometimes it's true for us to catch up to keep up am I right you're going to meetings innocently and you're getting bombarded [Music] you're going sitting there innocently and a speaker from somewhere else he's just speaking things right in line to throwing bombs hey we experienced that in the last week so what are we preaching 2023 it's time to manifest the revelation of the hour the time this is vicarious I don't know if I carry these things yeah you see me I'm a very practical person you see all my notes I've got so much more to show you tied to that number but I keep it with me so every chance I get every spare time I read it amen so we were sitting in this youth meeting and I'll I'll post the uh video up on our website I'm sure some of you want to hear the youth meeting right brother Adrian Grace testimony you can relax now I'm done preaching let's give the Lord a good example praise amen I think there was enough Revelation there to fill you up this morning amen so here we are sitting and we had a few witnesses there those of you that came to the meet to the youth meeting we sitting there and the brother is giving his testimony amen again brother submission is sitting next to me brother Jeff are they sitting there brother Joshua is sitting behind the Tyson is sitting next to me yeah so we'll end up planning to video this thing everything was being done and audio stream but something tells me pick up your phone and record and I'm thinking in my head hey my sister I'm going to record this thing I must hold it in my hand like this for one hour or two I don't know how long this brother is going to preach but anyway I pick up my phone and I stopped recording it some of the brothers must be thought I'm taking a little clip but if you saw me I was the whole time just there and my hand was shaky and I just somebody told me record these things amen and as the brother is giving his testimony I'm going to go to the clip now where you can hear it for yourself and that's why I recorded it and it was meant to be played here this morning and watch how that number pops up again now I want you to know he didn't know the significance of it the brother doesn't explain it even when we had lunch with it we'll answer them he didn't explain to us I told him I made clear prophecy to him and I told him exactly what it meant brother Joshua was witness to them and the brother we started to expound a few things based on that of the Angel of the Lord and you should watch like Revelation he says brother I see it he was like you know when you when somebody's enlightening brother Joshua you know that expression on his face he like couldn't contain himself and he said he's going to look into it amen so you hear it yes laughing and giggling there I think some of us were laughing because we couldn't hear what we couldn't believe what we were hearing amen so he's on his farm is busy bring work and he has an audible voice you are going to go to Russia right you are going to go to Russia he looks around he sees nobody there voice comes back you are going to go to Russia so over the time he's waiting for this manifestation remember he is not a famous preacher but the angel of the Lord told him you are going to go to Russia and you live from his testimony now how many years you took some of you already caught it by me just saying that how many years you took for you to come to pass and watch how innocently he's telling it but I tell you when he mentioned that like bombs were dropping on us because that's the inspiration of the album we're moving in let's just play that clip and then we're going to go to another testimony but I'll tell you about that testimony afterwards amen multiples on how much grasses on the certain that again not the Slime cooking problems and I can get an important because it's now important right okay you're going to Russia and there's no idea Force simply good one day if you're going to Russia then the voice of God and has stamped itself [Music] and what's your name is Russia so this is possibly so you think it disrespect him and it's been happening with the amount of time with God breaking the time you don't do what 50 years or 60 years it's just a couple of minutes waiting so taking so long it's kind of impossible so I'm going through for the next 23 years not knowing that the place I'm going to is that from the time the Lord spoke to me to go to Russia was 23 years with a famous cooking through Stars amen [Music] amen amen now that was just one right I'm going to give you a deep thought right now so this next one now was the last communion service we preached here right the last communion service we preached here some of you were here for the communion service I'm just giving you this clip because yeah I'm talking about Philip being transported and I'm telling you that we can see it again in our day amen I got the clip I didn't need to put myself up but I wanted the people that were not sure to see the spirit speaking and telling you to believe for that and you're the brother in the same testimony he tells you I'm not going to give it away but you can hear his testimony amen I'm going to give you a deep thought right now it may be happy to swallow because I still am digesting it and I still want this power and I still want this this the spirit of God to work in this way I'm believing for it Philip is in a normal flesh body like you and me he's like how you are seated here now no different watch what the spirit does and when he came up out of the water the spirit of the lord caught Philip away that the eunuch saw him no more and he went on his way rejoicing amen yes how if you believe in the Lord can transport you come on believe for your church if we did it in the book of Acts he can do it again [Music] yeah I hold the car felt paralyzing the rear league in White County is improved as she rolls over she'll drowning never again just just because that means heavy like this she hopes and falls down and again how to get him back up again I gotta get her away from that drink stands up holds and holds his holes down he's having for about half an hour to get her away from that Creek a shifter maybe uh it's a 7 8 to 30 meters or more and she falls down [Music] is Saturday after the sky encounters massive black crowd and a museum really gets to 200 millimeters of rain and three quarters of an hour and this whole it was a 12 person we would have had at least 25 millimeters of rain and Five Wounds [Music] and all the five is now getting covered in water and she's in a slightly in the Panic like this domestic part that's coming up and it doesn't and so he doesn't care paralyzed the water's coming up higher and higher and higher I can't get a tractor into the pack to to put her out and watch my podcast so she's there the only thing she's going to be shifted from there which is 15 we can't do it she's over water I got and I said Lord I looked and she's standing well again all right that was as fast as it like that whichever is Catholics terrorized water Dunkin Donuts see when I see it brought icon so there's an up-to-date testimony now if God is mindful of a cow for those of you didn't catch it the cow was paralyzed because it got electrocuted on the fence but one leg right and it was giving birth to a car so he pulls the calf out the cop is dead so because that lake is paralyzed it can't move and there's a creek there or cliff and he's trying to get it away so he keeps it a few meters away but where it falls is like a huge dip and he says then the rain came and he started to fill that place where this cow was sitting the cow was going to drown and that's when he says lord I can't do this on my own I can't take the cow out of there and he says just you are these words he said like a bullet the car was shifted from there 15 meters away amen quickening power [Music] now if we can believe for that if God is mindful of a cow if God can transport a cow quickening power can translate the musicians can come forward quickening power can transform it transport a car what about you how about other needs in your life you know we when people talk about the Supreme focus on the healing amen you've seen the power of God move and you've seen it going to finances you've seen it going to healing we've also seen it going into jobs you've seen it go into different areas of your life not just one specific area so the power of God is here this morning amen and if you want to say Lord I'm telling you it's still the season of Nissan it's still the first year of the month say Lord awaken me to what you are doing I don't want to miss it how many of you want to say that this morning amen say Lord I believe there's so much

chasing up the numbers the power of God we are telling you it's tied to the Holy Spirit we're telling it's tied to the Holy Ghost the angel of the Lord is here revealing himself what would make the brother talk about going to Russia 23 years later and the flag having 23 Stars why would he say that it's going people to hear it and people who need to hear it so that it can Quicken our faith why did he select Nissan 14th of March why did he do that are we the people called to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem [Music] could it be that a Revival breaks forth [Music] but can we step into it and say
