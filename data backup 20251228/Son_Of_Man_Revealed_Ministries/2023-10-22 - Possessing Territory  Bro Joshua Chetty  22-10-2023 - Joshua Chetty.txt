he puts his poison in the DS amen come to poison your mind with the things of the world Amen come to influence you amen demon powers Unleashed upon the Earth come to influence mankind amen and the battle is fought on where in no man's land the Battle Ground of the Mind amen and take the elet of Salvation And The Sword of the spirit which is the word of God Amen and that's where Satan always tried to infiltrate Man by bringing reasoning with the this that's why he started in the Garden of Eden by reasoning amen you know he couldn't bring something more superior to the word of God so he what what he did he brought in a reasoning amen amen praying always with all prayer yes so this is not your normal prayer praying for yourself praying for your wife praying for your children with all prayer amen that means you are praying with this with this in your mind that you have the mind of Christ and you are praying for their body amen with all types of prayer you're praying for the body of Christ you're praying for Israel You're praying for what is happening upon the Earth right now you're praying for the abomination of the loss all kinds of prayer and supplication in the spirit and watching there on to with all perseverance and suppli ation for All Saints amen amen amen you may be seated thank God for the reading of his word amen amen we speaking this morning on possessing territory amen amen you believe we living in the hour where we must possess all things yes amen not some things all things cuz we believe this is the Ephesian church amen and efficient parallels Joshua amen and in Joshua's Ministry it was promised to them that that's the generation that was going to come and possess the land amen that's the generation that's going to receive their inheritance amen that was the generation that was going to drive out all the hites all the parasites all the jeide going to drive out all the squatters in the land amen but who was with Joshua the captain of the Lord's host amen is this the hour where the angel of the Lord is here amongst us am amen so this is the hour of possessing all territory amen removing all squarters from the land Hallelujah the prophet of God says our Warfare is not carnal But Mighty casting away all reasons see pulling down the strongholds of Satan amen for 6,000 years Satan has been squatting upon the Earth amen and he started right there in God's Heathen he came and squatted upon God's heeden and he brought reasoning to God's people amen because Satan originally was in heaven and he was cast to the Earth and the Earth was created for man but Satan became a squatter because God created his son Adam there and Adam was to have dominion over the Earth amen but Satan became a squatter upon the Earth and became an inance to men and right now in this hour when hell is Unleashed upon the Earth demon powers are squatting upon the Earth you might not see the demons physically but they are in man that's right they are in system they are in laws amen they are through governments yes they are working through the United Nations they are working through the World Council of churches they are working to the UN ecumenical movements right they are strategic it's a strategic war and they become an inance amen and therefore you finding mankind trying to build the Earth man trying to accumulate his wealth and you're trying to they're trying to fight for territory all over the world but the Bible say don't you know the meek shall in the earth amen this Earth is for our possession amen am but the time is not now amen we will come back amen amen when when God totally destroys all sin on the earth amen we will come and Rule and Reign on the Earth but he's preparing us a people amen and we we are right now to possess territory it means that you should have your own armor on because we are in war amen yes we are at War and the war is reaching yes amen amen right now the world is looking at the natural word that's going on in Israel we know the natural Israel types spiritual Israel and spiritual Israel is the body of Christ amen and we know that we are in a Warfare amen amen and right now we know that it's coming the time where Satan is pointing is going to point all his Dart Theory darts at us yes because he's already got the church world Amen they not identified with the truth amen but we identified with the truth we identified with being in the presence of God we be identified with the true word of God and therefore there's going to come a squeeze upon the people in this hour amen and that's where you're going to stand with the truth or you're going to depart from the truth but in this hour of our's time you can't hide fruit amen therefore there was a falling away because why all these years you could hide in seed form but in Fruit form you cannot hide who you are amen and therefore you finding even now in the natural nations are siding with who they were siding with all the time they might have been hiding in all these years but now they are showing who they siding with amen and therefore we are showing who we are siding with amen we are standing with the TRU amen we are standing with the revealed word that's coming as our we W turn to the left we W turn to the right but we will stay with that say the Lord amen because this is the word that's come down to us through a prophet amen and was given and the message was given him through a mighty Angel amen yes what people don't see in this hour that the Mighty God that was come in human form 2,000 years ago go has now come and veil in a man in this day and man has missed it amen amen and now God is moving again and how he's moving through his many membered body to do the Greater Works amen because why you know this body must possess all territory amen all Promises of his word belongs to them because why she is him amen they must go upon the Earth and me and take up his name and be a reflector of him and do the same works that he did amen they must be the ones to heal the sick they must be the ones to raise the dead they must be the one to cast out Devils amen they need to possess all territory amen now you might say but we've got 200 million demons upon the Earth how do we do this he's given us weapons of mass destruction oh yes amen we have Atomic weapons amen we've got the reveal word in his hour amen and the devil cannot withstand it amen the opening of the word is yet the seals have been loose to us amen those seven tunders their voices it's all revealed to us amen amen and the devil cannot withstand Revelation because set the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it and therefore you find that for for years people have be become Scholars of the word studying the word and studying the word studying the history of it studying the the Greek terminologies of it studying the timeline of the word but yet could not be possessors amen yes amen amen until God had to sent a prophet amen yes in this day a prophet whom they couldn't recognize because he had a seventh grade education yes and he never come from one of their seminaries amen right amen he never come from one of these schools of theology amen but this Prophet was walking with the pillow of fire Hallelujah yes that walked that walked with Moses that walked with the children of Israel this Prophet was walking with the angel of Lord amen directing him amen the same angel of God that made Abraham amen the same one that made Abraham the same one that met Moses the same one that met Joshua amen that same God that was here today amen yes that's right thank never happened 2,000 years to church history but the pull of fire after 2,000 years come down thank you Lord never be a day like this day yes right and therefore he could go and possess every way the the soul of his feet could tread upon he was possessing it amen travel the world taking the message across but he was possessing territory stored up the food but he knew in the due time in due season there's going to be a people that's going to receive this word it might have been hard for the Pentecostal babes to digest it then because why the digestive system couldn't take it they were babies amen but there's going to be a different type of people upon the Earth in a selected time in a selected season oh when they're ready to do Warfare they're going to receive this word amen and they're going to become soldiers in the Kingdom amen they're going to be valent soldiers in this kingdom yes oh God thank you Lord Mighty Warriors thank you Lord amen after receiving this word oh they're going to go out they're not going to be afraid because why amen perfect love casting away all fear amen they're going to be walking in perfect Faith why they're going to see themselves in the word yes they're going to see themselves walking out of the scriptures thank they're not going to see themselves as oh I'm just following church as a form of religion I'm just going to church I'm just a Christian to satisfy my conscience no they see themselves in the scriptures amen you know behold I send you Malachi amen Malachi 45 and6 belongs to them amen yes thank you Lord amen they put themselves in the scriptures they put themselves say thou must prophesy again before Nation tongues and kings and say that is me amen that is my Ministry amen amen how must I prophesy it means I must possess Nations tongues Kings enemies I must possess their territory he belongs to me amen you got all that now you have to withstand all those demon powers because mankind has been influenced with all your contemporary preachers that that has infiltrated their minds with their dogmas with their Creeds with all the man-made systems yes so you're going to have to possess all the territory amen amen yes thank you Lord thank you he says but God at the beginning gave his children the atomic weapon yes because he is the infinite God amen amen now seeing there was going to be a conflict and there was going to be a battle God equipped his children with the right kind of ammunition amen thank than you Lord amen he's not giving us the old you know the Old World War I weapons now or the old rifles they used to use those days put one round in you know in the Ang B you put one round in you shoot then you must again no he give us the right kind of ammunition yes you're not facing one demon two demon you got 200 million demon Unleashed upon the Earth you're going to need the right ammunition in the hour amen right kind of attack the right kind of everything that they need of that would sweep them all the way from Eden to the Rapture what was it the word amen that word defeat Satan is the word I'll defeat him any way any place now why do we want to substitute something else when we already got the best amen thing that there is the word amen amen than you Lord so don't go and fight your battles that you are facing with your own abilities I was just thinking today many years ago my father was praying for the demon case and I used I used to do training I thought I was fit you know so I trying to hold this person down kindly you know like try to use your own ability you can't hold a demon Spirit down with your own sin amen we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against powers and principalities and rulers of Darkness against spiritual wickedness amen the devil in that person need to recognize their Authority in you because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen amen the devil must recognize the authority that you are walking with oh yes Lord and when you know who you are in the words when you see yourself in the scripture and you're walking by Divine Authority you won't mince your words to the devil amen you're going to pray for the sick you're not going to Min your words you're going to say in the name of Jesus Christ like Peter and John Silver and Gold Have we none but such as we have in the name of Jesus Christ rise up and walk amen am amen you won't be missing your words when you're walking in Authority amen you're not taking a chance you're not playing guessing games yeah amen because this is the hour of the third pool amen when something drops they come the time when something drops down there amen amen when something drops down there amen do you know there's nothing to do with you it's nothing to do with your emotions it's nothing to do with your feelings about the situation amen but just like hat writes when the prophet was describing to her what happened there and how the squirel came and she said that's the ab that is nothing but the truth amen then what happened something dropped there something dropped down there in the in the prophet and he knew that he could tell that he right ask for anything you desire amen amen thank you Lord he knew that this is the hour now amen this is the hour where he says we're not relying upon ourselves but we are just equipped amen so all these years God has been equipping us we had all these years of equipping but right now the why is Raging amen we're right now in the Battlefront we're going out in the Battlefront we're facing the enemy every day the minute we walk out here we're facing the enemy amen thank you Lord the enemy has also captured some of our families right captured some of our friends captured some Believers in a backl condition we got to go and rescue them amen amen you had the message on Wednesday how Abraham had to go and rescue lot amen lot wasn't amongst Abraham lot went amongst the world but Abraham still went to rescue him am amen so we have to go and rescue our loved ones it's just like now in this Israel world those people out there they were out partying there they were having a r party they were they were actually they were for the Palestinians they were Pro Palestinians those people having a peace party in other words they were caught up with the system that was going on but Israel still trying to will have to go and rescue them because that's how they know they have to go rescue the brothers so just like that spiritually speaking we have to go and rescue amen amen those that are held captive by Satan those that are bound by Satan we have to go and rescue them amen amen the Bible says those that are filled with the Holy Ghost are crying and sign for the Abominations of the Lost amen we know the devil got them bound but the Bible say whatever you loose on Earth shall be Loos in heaven amen whatever you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven yes amen amen thank you Lord he says in the message the great warrior Joshua he says Hallelujah devils are on the Move amen for Jesus Christ the chief Captain said in my name shall they cast out Devils amen amen they failed to get it 40 years ago listen to this this is in the wilderness they failed to get it but we're coming in now this is under Joshua now under the Holy Ghost amen possessing the land amen the same full of fire the same Chief Captain is a leading the host of the lord it's your land god promise to prosper you in health amen amen amen amen don't let the devil tell you now whatever your condition you got there's nothing you can do you just live it's a chronic illness that's what the devil put that reasoning there yes the doctor said it's chronic you just have to treat it medically and you continue treating it and you will live like this till you die right with this condition chronic no but he promised to prosper you in El amen he gave you that body it's yours by possession yes because that body is the temple of God Amen because God can't work without a body amen God needs to work with humans just like the devil the devil also need bodies yes and that's why the devil is going around he's saying who doesn't have the Holy Ghost who's not full of the Holy Ghost then he can possess them so therefore you make sure you get the Holy Ghost amen cuz you're not full with the Holy Ghost you come Justified you come Sanctified you cleaned up it's the perfect ground for the devil to come in am and the devil is not a gentleman like the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost don't just come in yes amen yes you notice the difference between soldiers and terrorists when soldiers our terrorist comes in and how they ravish the people but soldiers go in by Rules of Engagement in Warfare the Holy Ghost don't just budge him that's right so the devil wants to come and possess those bodies but he says God has given you that body amen y body is for the god placed you in this season in this time and in you he's placing you in the the wickedest age the darkest of all age when hell and death is following amen the rider is riding with hell and death amen in the most in the age of insanity you know the prophet preach the message the invasion of the USA but now it's the invasion of the whole world am amen where where demons have invaded amen it's an age of insanity man will believe any lie man will glorify sin sin is glorified we are living in the hour where sin is glorified amen and if a person I was watching recently a person that was trying to thank God in his spot thing was basically the media and all wouldn't cover that and wouldn't even you know notice that but when people do sinful things in a spotting Arena they will glorify it that's the condition that you are living in man is gone worse than the animal kingdom man is in such a condition because they have allowed themselves to be possessed by demon Spirits yes amen Sodom must have been Sodom burnt up but the demons never die that's right the demons were waiting for the right time and age to come again upon the Earth and they here all over now amen the same demons that was God the Bible say God ared Pharaoh's heart God is aring certain people's hearts and God will their heart because why he wants to get these people on the Move amen but he said he gave you body is your possession the devil is trying to take it over he hasn't got the authority to do it amen amen amen thank you Lord he trembling tonight thank you and yeah in this hour amen when the mighty works of God is being displayed amongst his children yes I believe the devil is trembling he didn't anticipate this yes he thought he got the people just saying I got the the word I got the word I got the word he never expected the hour where there be a manifestation of the word amen amen thank you and I believe the devil is trembling now because the people recognize their position in the word they recognize them see themselves in the scripture and they're not just seeing themselves now they're going out and they possessing territory they going out and driving the squats from their lives amen all those demon powers that was bound binding them all his years amen each one of us had to go to repentance we had to come back to the altar we had to do a cleaning up amen thank you Lord get rid of all those quarters thank you Jesus great world of power God moving it so God he hasn't got the authority he's trembling tonight great world of God's power moving you talking about that moving in the building Satan's trembling oh they' only have faith his heart's about gone it melted in him or you say well the doctor said yay but they realize that the host of the Lord is moving in now amen and this is the hour where we know that the angel of God is here amongst us yes and the host of God's Army is behind us amen yes amen and therefore not even he saying hey what kind of people is this this was happening in the days of William brandham now there's a people upon the earth now they saying they're not worried what the doctor says amen they're not interested in the doctor's reports they doing spiritual Diagnostics they're recognizing that I put my demon in there one of my imps I put in there and they're recognizing they're calling that they're calling that cancer a demon yes yes yes amen yes Lord amen they're calling their depression a demon yes upon the people coming to oppress the people the oppressing spirit coming to oppress the people amen oh these people where did they come from Satan is trembling in his hour amen hallelujah right now he's in distress he's going he has to go into hiding amen yeah he can't come and confront you face to face but the B but the prophet said there has to be soon you're going to come to that contest you're going to have to face him face to face amen you have to face him you can't hide from that you're going to have to face him face to face amen but greater is he he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen Matthew 11:12 says and from the days of John the Baptist and now the kingdom of of Heaven suffered violence and the violence taken it by force amen prophet of God say like Israel back in the promised land she don't know how she got there she was just automatically put back there why National Force put her in a place yeah now I'm going to say something National Force put Israel in a Homeland National Force will put the church in the world Council of churches but the power of God will put the people in The Bride amen he says the world forces this way and the world forces that way but God forces upward the spirit of God which is the word of God he said my word is spirit and life will put the bride in a place yes because you recognize a position in the word amen then she in Christ will put her in a place no National Force will do it but the National Force did Drive Israel to the Homeland and the national forces of the Council of churches will drive every organization into it but the power of God will raise the bride into Glory out of it amen amen you Lord amen hallelujah thank you Jesus so we find that it takes the power of God to put us not by might not by power but but my but by my spirit says the Lord it will take the power of God to place God's people in The Bride amen and therefore everyone that comes in this in into the bride into the body of Christ had to come by a supernatural experience amen no if you came here not by Supernatural EXP experience and you came here to satisfy your conscience that this is just church you'll go out just like that amen but if you brought in your supernaturally nothing can move you am nothing can take you out of here amen because why you are part of the vine amen amen you're the branches but you are part of the vine and you are staying one with the vine and you're drawing from the vine amen then the life that was in a Vine must be in you and produce the same Works amen amen amen he says now Satan will constantly punch at you until you are finished here on Earth just remember that you see what I'm saying now we are at War we are not here on a vacation yes right we are not here as long as you are in this past hours yes as long as you are still in a SP house you are in a constant battle amen there's no time to sleep and Slumber and sleep there's no time to be stratful because we at War amen amen so in other words we got to be watch we got to watch and pray we got to watch and pray we got to keep on the armor all the time we can't take our arm out we got to keep out the hel of Salvation The Shield of Faith blessed PL of righteousness the God of Truth amen so we got to have the gospel of peace so all these things we got to have on all the time amen and sometimes you might be weary but that's why you got your brother if you see a brother down pick up your brother amen from his condition and that's why you come under the covering amen that is why is so important we tell people do not stay out of the covering amen amen amen God has given the fivefold ministry to equip you yes to equip you what in this Warfare amen and to prepare you a body equipped that will take you out of here amen and that is why you got to be under a covering you can't be a oneman b right yes you got to come under the fivefold ministry amen amen you got to come under a covering you got to be in constant fellowship and you got to come in the unity of the faith amen that why you fin under this time there coming a squeeze where you see there's going to be such a Unity amongst the Believers there must be such a love one believer to another believer amen but this shall all men know that you are my disciples when you have love one towards another yes amen amen yes now Satan will constantly punch at you until you finish here on Earth just remember that you'll never have a time but what's there a punching going on all the time cuz you're in a battle amen did you ask to come to Christ to going on a picnic to a picnic well you're sure going to be surprised because it's a constant battle I've been on the field for 31 years and have fought every inch of the way that's right Israel had to fight every inch of the way Palestine was given to them but they had to fight every inch of the way to get it amen all the promise in the Bible belongs to us amen you are blessed Ephesians say you are blessed with all spiritual blessings amen amen all Redemptive blessings belongs to us healing belongs to us Deliverance belongs to us amen all these things belongs to us and all the people that you are saying blessed they blessed because of us amen amen but you have to fight yes you have to fight your ground amen you want healing then you must come the right way amen amen approach it through the word amen God has given the prescription through the word for every situation that you have God has given the prescription yes and God works in that way amen God doesn't change his ways that's right amen amen he says why it depends on what you're looking at if you're looking at your hand just it will still stay that way if you're looking at your tumor it will remain that way he say look away from that amen hallelujah amen don't look at your circumstance don't allow that five senses to make you fathom what's in front of you look upon the promise amen amen look at it Through The Eyes of God's words Hallelujah when you see yourself look at the way God saw you amen when you look at your situation put yourself and say how would God look at it amen look at it through the way your father looks at it understand his nature understand the way he go and speak to situation understand the way he speaks to the storm encounters it amen understand your Lord's nature amen amen understand his ways learn his ways become one with his ways and then project his ways amen amen amen and then you will see the same results that's right because it's the same yesterday today and forever amen amen he said if you look at your TR it'll remain that way look away from that look at the promise of God it depends on what you're looking at Christians look at the Unseen amen Abraham called things which were not as though they were because God said they were that's the way real Christians do no matter what the world says what it looks like that has nothing to do with it if what God said about it what does it God told them way down in Egypt I give you that land but he didn't say I'll go then sweep it all out and garnish the tops and hang up the curtains and everything just you all just moving no no they are to fight for every inch of ground they took amen amen that's right fighting and take it fight every inch every way The Souls of your foot Land The Possession footsteps is possession amen amen he said that the same thing is today Divine healings belongs to us the Holy Spirit belongs to us it's our prop property but you'll fight every inch of it yes sir but brother footsteps is possession just keep fighting take it the devil say the days of Miracle passed so you're lying God said is the same yesterday today and forever take it everywhere your footsteps that's possession so we find that right now the church World everyone's claiming to have healing claiming to have all these things but without the original they had to have the original on the Earth being manifested first before they go and replicate it before they go out and he had to come through the prophet and that Spirit added all these things and from there because 2,000 years ago there was no such thing as people heard wasn't hearing about the Z and things like that but after that the spirit of discernment come and now people are claiming to prophesy why think they all God rampen on it because they could see they they they saw that nothing like this was on the earth since Bible times yes that's right and they all trying to be prophets all trying claim to be healers all time to do all these things but the discernment is right now in the body of Christ amen discernment is here yes I'm not talking about the way with the prophet when the when the son of man Ministry I'm talking about discernment through the word amen through the preaching of the word the Holy Spirit still Discerning Hearts still Discerning thoughts still picking up needs still moving through the place still coming and speaking to

can't look at it conly yeah it's a Warfare between God and Satan yes because Satan must fulfill his agenda we know that he's got an agenda and God knows Satan's agenda is letting him go because it's all in God's great plan and purpose because ultimately this is God's story amen and that was the first Warfare and it's still raging yes but oh I'm so glad it's soon coming to an end and it all be over amen amen aren't you glad we are right now when all these things are happening around us we are looking up yes our Redemption draw it near yes amen we know that we're ready now because we know

final battle of the Gentile dispensation and once the Gentile doors close the gospel must move to the Jews yes amen they was blinded for the 2,000 years for the saving of the Gentiles amen amen God blinded them those Jews God blinded them understand that you might say Jews speaking about Jes they don't know Jesus they were blinded they wasn't going to see Jesus amen there were some that were saved but the real Orthodox Jews don't know Jesus amen and right now they might be using military might whatever but the Orthodox Jews going to need to realize they going to wait for the prophets to come on the scene amen if you think the the battles are raging on the earth now now watch when till Moses and Elijah come down unleashing the six seal then what the people going to say when they are unleashing because now is not what this is only amate tribulation watch when Moses Elijah comes down unleash those six seals upon the Earth that's why the Bible says after the bodies after they killed them and they were dead and the bodies were laying there the people were giving gifts to to each other celebrating in the streets celebrating everywhere because they're going to unleash torment upon the Earth like you never seen before but before that happens before we leave here we are in this Battlefront right now we need to possess all territory amen amen we need to claim those that needs to come in still amen amen those that Satan is holding them bound that kept them captive the enemy has kept them for captive for too long even amongst us maybe the devil has kept them captive it's time to go and rescue them amen time to bring them back to the Battlefront amen and say Lord I got my inhabitance I can see where I am in the scripture but my brother never receive his inheritance he needs to possess his inheritance let me go and all my brother's arms let me go and battle with my brother and see what is witholding his inheritance let me go and drive out the enemies with him amen hallelujah amen the things that are injuring him in his life amen there are things that are affecting his borders amen let me go and drive all the squatters from his territory amen complete deliverance in this hour hallelujah amen than what a wonderful time we living in amen he says so we in a Warfare right and God's Heroes always Warfare and you little church remember back there you are part of that unit you're an outpost back here that you know what an outpost is you should be you should by being some of it right here by you you an outpost back here to place to keep up the banners to do what's right to still claim Jesus Christ The Only Hope of the world Amen he said not the Methodist Church not the Baptist Church the Presbyterian idea the Catholic or the Jewish or whatever it might be race Clan or color that's not it it's Jesus Christ he's the one he is our Victor he is the one he's the chief captain of the move amen this is his orders and we were got to carry out orders amen amen and what his orders to us thou must prophesy again amen before Nation tongues and Kings amen that's the orders to us thou shall possess the the gates of the enemy amen thou sht have no other gods before me amen what that means what's the god something that you worship something that you keep as an idol something that you spend more time with thou shall have no other God before me thou shall love the Lord your God all your might with all your strength amen you should have your love for your God Amen that means love the things of God love is word love is people if you love God you love God by loving his people amen amen and how you serve God by serving his people amen by servanthood when you come by servant you are doing the Priestly work because he made us Kings and Priests and he's priest if he's priest we must be priests people want to run to be the king but they don't want to be the priest and the priest is the one of intercessing yes priest is the one crying and sighing for the abomination of the Lost worried about your brother that's done down pick up lift up your brother or else you too will be tempted amen didn't the bible say that when your brother is ination lift him up yes or else you too will be tempted amen don't put your brother down and then bang him to the ground yeah that's right amen then the Bible says don't look at Speck of dust in your brother's eye when you got a beam in your eye hallelujah amen he that is need not a phys that's why we are here this morning amen amen he if we all were perfect if we all were already perfect we are perfected in God's eyes but the flesh man will always be it's always at War this flesh man this pest out it wants to keep us from our blessings this is the enemy this is the enemy when you go to look yourself in the Mir and say that's your enemy we are always battling with this enemy yes we want to blame everybody else but this is our biggest enemy amen we need to bring this under subjection amen yes and the only way you can bring under subjection when you when you see yourself the way God sees you amen otherwise you're going to keep yourself in condemnation the Bible says there therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus and are called according to his purpose amen so if you want to keep yourself in condemnation you are not seeing yourself the way God sees you you are seeing yourself your enemy that's why I'm saying you are the enemy you are looking yourself is condemning you amen you get what I'm saying amen you're looking yourself through your own self your own ability now that brings condemnation and the devil will play with that on the mind but when you look at yourself the way God sees you am you're not relying upon yourself thank you Lord you like the SC said I will present myself amen a glorious Church without spot without wrinkle without blemish she will be a super Church she will be a super race amen yes amen hallelujah thank you Lord amen amen oh the enemy should be trembling right now amen and the promise that we receive the seal is a baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right amen for that is God in form of spirit you being his word in you then he comes in if you receive the word in you the holy spirit is the only thing that can make that love and then you have the promise of possessing the Gate of the enemy that tries to attack you that's right God promised it and so I'm sure Joshua ising why I didn't the Cod that I gave him is not here God shared my whole message this morning he knows what I'm talking about cuz I gave him a whole lot of quotes and he's not here God gave me his word in the morning amen and I was battling I said Lord why I'm not getting what you want me to say and I Was preparing something else but the Lord has given me this word I don't know why but he G me this word in the morning and I'm sure you must be wondering why I'm giving I'm speaking about other things though yeah so this is the battle this is the Forefront amen amen we thank God that he's given us the five-fold ministry amen given us Apostles the prophets amen pastors teachers evangelists and that's why each one of us has to be under a covering if you're not under a covering and say no I'm just I believe the message I I remember when I first came in the message I was there at the library and a brother came came from jber and we was having some fellowship and he asked me where our fellowship and I told him he said brother I got it from the officer mouth he wasn't in you get what I'm saying he said I got it it from the O's mouth itself so he tried to tell me that he's not going to Fellowship he just got it from the O's mouth so if we don't gather together yes yes then then how can we how can the five-fold ministry be of effect then if you don't gather together how can we come in the unity of the faith then how can we come together in one mind one spirit in one Accord under one baptism amen amen and then remember God doesn't work aasly in his Warfare even in the war you got different ranks right you got your generals you got your Colonels and you got your Majors your captain so forth and then you got you got you got your air battle you got your ground battle you got your troops and then you got your troops on the ground and things like that so that's how God works he's got different gifts in the church amen amen he's got different gifts that he uses he G blessed us with all spiritual gifts amen and therefore the spiritual gifts are operating in every church he should be operating every local assembly amen and then he's got different Rank and file in his different Rank and file another different Ministries that is ordained in the church for different purposes amen some will preach the word some will will go out in the field some will maybe help the go and testify some will will pray for the sick some got a gift to pray for the sick all type all these gifts are used for the body of Christ for the benefit of the body but under one goal fighting one common enemy amen we using his gifts not to show that I'm popped up or it's for me or I got to certain no we are using on one common goal is to defeat the enemy the enemy sat is already defeated but he he is constantly attacking us yes he constantly what is a p to us yes so we need to use these gifts in the church to conquer the enemy amen so that is why there's no other greatest weapon that he given us but his word in this hour amen amen amen and this word is the super weapon that he's given us the atomic weapon the super weapon amen that the the Catholic Church the Methodist Church the Baptist Church the Presbyterian Church the Pentecostal Church could not produce this the devil could not produce this weapon here yes because this is the weapon he said to Peter we all I give you the keys to the kingdom and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it amen what was that the gift uh the keys to spiritual Revelation amen and when he come and reveal that why this word wasn't a public show the opening of the word was not a public show it was a secret amen amen and it wasn't revealed to everybody else you and I might see it plainly starting all the way from starting all the way from the Garden of Eden from serpent seed and going forth to True baptism to the baptism of the Holy Ghost to the horse riders to the seven trumpets to the seven vials all these things to the seven the seven tand the seven Trumpets the seven vials all these things knowing that between the six and seven tret what is happening right now knowing that Moses and Elijah will have to call to the Jews from 1948 Naomi going back to the Homeland why Naomi was going back to the Homeland while she was going back in the Homeland root was coming along amen amen and while root was coming along he was dealing with root amen we dealing with root after that amen and root and Bo come together in a union and produce a child amen amen hallelujah amen Christ must be produced again amen and then all this is happening and then we know that the gospel must go back to the Jews amen Moses and Elijah must come on the scene but before Moses and before the ending of the battle amen God is working amongst us where is God while everyone's focused right now on natural things on the natural Wars and all that there is a spiritual war going on why there a spiritual war the superpower Hallelujah the somebody realize there superpower amen the word made her recognize that she's not an ordinary person upon the Earth she's not an Ordinary People upon the Earth the word made her recognize that she's not an ordinary species amen through Jesus Christ to the second Adam amen she's now a new species amen she's a species of the almighty God she's a supernatural species s in a flesh body and she now recognized through the opening of the word that she become a superpower and in Army amen and therefore she a super race and now she's in a position Hallelujah and now she speaking on her terms amen she's not compromising she's speaking in her terms just like eser amen she had to change this the king's decree was already out there but she had to now change the the decree what to happen to what the Jews had to do Amen to save themselves she had to speak on her terms and the same one that came to destroy her got destroyed amen yeah yes am man I wonder why it's always the edge the a the Hitlers theas theas but she it had to come under her terms amen amen and she recognized that she is the super power in his hour amen she has got the greatest atomic weapon in his hour amen all these years no one knew she was secretly it was secretly she had it amen but right now she's rised up in power she's raised up in power she's raised up to know who she is am you know this listening the other day the isra minister said we haven't even started yet this bride has just started now amen just watch so what she's going to unleash upon the Earth amen
