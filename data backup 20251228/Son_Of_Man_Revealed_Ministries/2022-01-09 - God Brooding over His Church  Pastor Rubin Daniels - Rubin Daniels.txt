amen blessed be the name of the lord amen so the way god deals with the earth in the beginning that's the way god deals with the individual amen amen your life and my life amen we came into this world speaking lies we came into this world born in sun and shaped in iniquity amen covered with darkness without shed without form and we were void amen and and i just want to type it this morning for what happened in the beginning amen our first quotation in the smyrna church h allow me to read i believe this church loves the message of the old man amen amen the smell of hallelujah age the prophet says now then there we are coming to a conclusion as the eternal logos which is god amen was manifest in the sun and in jesus dwell all the fullness of the goddess amen and that eternal one was the father manifested in flesh and thereby gain the title of sun even so we eternal in his thoughts in our turn became the many members spoken word seed manifest in flesh and those eternal thoughts now manifested in flesh are the sons of god amen even as we are so called we did not become seed by the rebirth yes we were seed and therefore were reborn for only the elect can be reborn amen because we were see in the is the reason we could be quickened amen none see there is nothing to quicken this is the principle of god yes if we understand that we were we will see the continuity amen in the beginning when god saw amen that the earth even was without form and void he could have gone to mars he could have gone to any other planet that was around amen but his choice and focus was on earth you know why the prophet also teaches us amen that the earth is a piece of the sun amen he says the earth broke off from the sun many many many years ago amen and spending amen brother sister in a direction and cooling off amen you and i apart and attribute amen of the son of god of god himself amen breaking our way man and cooling off someone coming into this world even covered with darkness amen we needed someone to move blessed be the name of the law the earth was without form the word was a wilderness a place of chaos a place of confusion a place of nothingness church of the living god as much as we think amen so much about ourselves and the world think so much about themselves this is what we were when we came to the world and some of us are still in that condition and not realizing that they're nothing outside of god amen amen have a great respect for those amen that are caries of the jumped seed of life amen brother sister you are a manifestation amen you are born of his bone and you are flesh of his flesh hallelujah we come from god and we are going back to god that makes you and i differently amen now the earth is a type of us problem says god does not do things without a reason hallelujah and god doesn't change his mind we told the church last week when god amen gave uh moses when the the the blue crunch yes amen of the tabernacle or or the ark it was called the ark in the beginning amen and and this is so many cubits and this is so many cubers amen there's an and then out of god should be there amen and then an inner court and then the most holy place and that pattern god followed amen throughout amen the word because three amen is god's number amen there's the number that god moves in a solomon comes he builds a temple and what do you know amen is trees again yes amen and yeah you're sitting this morning body amen spirit and soul histories again and there's a number that god moves in and says his father's son and holy ghost he says these three are one amen and he's not going to change he's not going to change he has a purpose for everything amen we have to thank god for that does he know him blessed be the name of the lord he's not only dealing with the earth but with the element of redemption amen if we turn our bibles to isaiah chapter 60 amen let's hear what the bible says in isaiah chapter 60 amen are going to focus on this too but i want to read this one as well the bible says arise and shine for thy light is coming and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee verse 2 says for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and growth darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and the glory shall be seen hallelujah amen darkness on the earth yes amen but there is a promise hallelujah to you and i am amen amen amen hallelujah with all hanging there in space amen covered with darkness and coveted water amen waiting hallelujah aiming for the rising of the sun waiting for the moving of the spirit hallelujah amen moving means brooding aiming already amen over the waters amen brother sister sees amen over his church amen brother sister yeah we sprung up amen one in things one in congress one in heaven and brother sister that's how amen brother sister that's when the spirit moves i want to tell you this morning is present hallelujah the same spirit hallelujah could use that mighty thing amen let's not place him there let's bring him down amen present time and he can move from sea to sea this morning finally when the spirit move something happens hallelujah remember brother sister amen the uh the the the sick man laying brother sister [Music] amen when god moves about the sister it may something happen but unfortunately the prophet teaches us amen when god moves satan moves amen and we brother sister the church of the living god is the bride of christ should be aware of them hallelujah and because god has given us a certain power that it did not give the enemy that makes a difference this morning amen when the chorus leader was here and trying to create an atmosphere for the world to come you know what satan cannot create amen amen but already you are potential aim and have the ability to really amen and you created an atmosphere aiming for him to come and every eminence because he's here this morning amen shouldn't there be any sickness this morning amen this morning i trust god this morning to deliver amen each and every one [Music] a good feeling it's a reality church amen you can reach out and touch the helm of his garment this morning and you will sense virtue must grow and you will sense amen hallelujah i came in here this morning my knees were aching hallelujah but god touched me the darkness shall cover the earth but the lord shall arise upon thee this makes him the rising of the son amen hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so the earth that is spinning out of control of the city just out of control amen but in god's amen order covered with water can't really see anything but there are seeds beneath those waters notice is just writing out the mystery of our lives the way god deals with the earth that's how god deals with us yes came into this world seemingly no direction hallelujah how many of us and one of them amen and denied this message hallelujah is all you know but if you come through denominationalism amen systems amen brother sister you know what i'm talking about it wasn't easy to believe that god is sent as a prophet amen you're born in the in in the 58 amen you girl you just finished your school in the 76 and and and and you were you you you you you experienced amen brother sister amen the afrikaans and your experience brother sister uh the riots of those days and yeah comes a white prophet on the scene oh not even worse you understand how difficult it was amen god reaching mercy hallelujah he let us look right back amen and compare what we have and what amen this mama eagle is offering there's a scream that's calling there's a scream that you recognize and we thank god that the ability was in us aiming to recognize amen brother sister eagle and mama eagles boys so many watts against us yes hallelujah brother sister amy whis was so used amen you have to devour certain uniform you have to do this destiny and all the rituals that goes along with the normal rationalism and here comes a message of the hour amen telling you amen that is not a mental requirement amen from the word of god amen oh how confused we were amen but digging into the message amen hallelujah god guided us amen slowly spirit was a movie thank you slowly amen he was dividing amen the land from the waters amen and slowly was uploading on our lives amen and the sea inside of us amen without our choice amen hallelujah what was what was amen in the world and was responding and growing brother sister and the churches come my man the pastors of those days and putting concrete blocks upon us to keep us amen in our systems amen but not knowing brother sister the power of a seed amen brother says that nothing can stop us amen brother sister to the seekers of concrete even in the direction of the sun amen because it is pulling us in and out of darkness and out of the chaos it's hallelujah interpretations of the spirit that was moving amen in the beginning new versions of the bible and old versions amen and translations and so on amen the one says it was called the wind of heaven hallelujah that was moving on the earth the other one says it was the breath of god amen that was moving on the earth i don't mind i don't care what they call it amen what's the spirit of moving yes amen our prophet says it was the energy of life it was moving in over the earth not visible but yet ecstatic and inspiring amen hallelujah even i was sitting in a hotel room yesterday amen and the creator came in there and i said man i'm writing here a moya amen he's like spelling writing spelling to us he was laughing he said no that i a y a a man brother sister it was not just the moya yes [Music] it was the same breath amen that god blew in the nostrils of adam it was not just ammonia it was a life and adam became a living soul when god moves church amen it's not just the wind it's not just the sounding of drums amen good music amen and poor person and sleeps performance no brother it's ecstatic it's a move of god it's a life to the individual yes amen that's when god moves hallelujah and the bride of christ we've been fooled through the years but now church our eyes have been opened we identify and we can see when it's gone amen or whether it's man amen amen hallelujah yes you love the lord this morning amen amen so now we've seen what has been done to the earth and the prophet says now we know what needs to be done to us in the beginning his focus was maybe you think it was just on the earth but problem says differently he says it was not just on the earth he says he did not send a pastor in the beginning yeah to move over the waters do not send an angel he did not send a prophet to move over the waters amen that was a big man's job became himself hallelujah and he moved brother sister we might got the inspiration we might got the message we thank god for our but i dare you today this work is performed in you is of the holy ghost amen hallelujah he's god himself yes amen amen he has done his part amen is brought as amen right up amen to our our husband amen amen i introduced to you amen a changed version yes amen but he couldn't go with us into the tent yeah yeah holiday to stay outside amen his work was done and that's where we are it depends amen which stage of the journey we are this morning i believe we've ended into the most holy place amen i believe we've ended into the tent yes amen without isaac this morning blessed be the name of the lord his own energy of life it was his spirit says that elohim was the first outburst of the fullness of his divine personality hardly that's what god used the first outburst of his personality let me explain it this way god is so great church he folds our crevices yeah he felt all space yeah that is why this man this morning we can truly say god can't really come down [Music] he's here it's all over he's not understand he's all always here he can't come down what needs to happen is we have to break into a dimension where he is in order to see and to experience the love of god and to experience the grace of god you have to move into that dimension amen and god has made it possible amen for the yes it's not everybody that has the right to enter into that this is the dimension yes but you and i brother sister that's the power you and i brother sister privately people move into that dimension we can make contact brother sister with eternal feet amen we come back here amen and we feel so sad and brother sister the cares of life and all that but then god lifts us up that should be the song amen of our heart this morning lord lift me up and let me stand my faith in heaven a higher plane that i have found lord blunt my feet on higher ground the church out there and the world out there can't see it amen as much as we say angels cannot sing the songs amazing grace redeem our love they don't know what it needs to be lost denominations can sing songs [Applause] [Music] amen brother sisters our testimony amen this will be the name of the lord hallelujah do we still have some time amen that's what says two o'clock i don't know what's it [Laughter] younger such a flight man normally over an hour and a half i know us yeah we thank the lord let's look at the the first movement of the sublime revelation of the goddess the first movement god breakthrough and now he's breaking down slowly amen still that great god yes amen but manifesting himself in different ways you're putting a mask on amen until it came down as low as becoming man yes and even die for us the same god yeah and the prophet says that is what was taking place amen when you look at the scripture this morning it's all the work of christ amen hallelujah god's choice yes amen to bring us back and also problem says it is to pull out of him yes yes amen what was hidden in him right now he brother said to no earth no adam yes amen okay yeah no garden no adam okay the garden hallelujah no sun no redemption yes hallelujah how would we know that he's the great healer somebody amen great now we sing songs a great position now is here the symphonizing jesus why somebody got sick and before a problem god is already an answer yes you may not god is envisioned amen this whole program nothing is out of case the church we lose a loved one this happened and that happened you lose your job you become sick amen it's all according to god's plan yes it says lord amen have thy own way thou art the butter and i am the clay lord amen this movement direct us in your way this morning amen in fact the prophet says man was not made to move for himself yes always be dependent amen of the on the leadership of the holy ghost amen and i tell you this morning there's a quote that brother brother says amen he says amen as a god leads the birds to trackless skies and the fish do trackless waters no roadsides no nothing but they know directly amen which way to go that's how god wants to track and threaten and lead the individual if we can only allow him amen hallelujah amen we don't know the way yes hallelujah he says i am the way i am the truth i am the light put your trust in him amen we've got great men today hallelujah even in message realms amen they go above apostles and they go right above the prophet even and they go right above even god [Music] it's only god that wants that that is a desire to become men yes everybody wants to be so great and become gods and gods hallelujah but that's god amen desire to become yours and he can make himself so small that he can enter your heart amen amen establish his throne in the hearts of believers and then rule from there amen hallelujah open your heart this morning amen hallelujah some 33 with six [Music] psalm 23 6. amen how david and them knew all these things there was no bibles before that amen but by inspiration they could record amen rejoice in the lord oh he righteous praise his comely for the upright praise the lord with heart sin unto him with the sultry and an instrument of tense twins sing unto him a new song play skillfully with a loud noise listen here for the lord for the word of the lord is right and all his words are done in truth he loveth righteousness and judgment the earth is full of the goodness of the lord by the word of the lord with the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth what kind of breath was that hallelujah amen by the word of the lord and by the breath of god was what you see today and i believe this morning it is why we are called spoken word children hallelujah by the word of god yes amen we were spoken in the beginning where the land comes from you know where the land come from the bible says before the foundation of the world the lamb muslim that's where the land come from yes and that's where you come from amen hallelujah we come from the same place where the lamb comes from amen because we were a part of him as the prophet said in the beginning he says amen our rebirth did not make us sin and let me tell you the message did not make us see amen but we came into this world amen the seed was there yes amen you just needed amen hallelujah the egg doesn't matter amen amen or a mouse is born in the garage and then it becomes a car no the seed was already there a mouse it was in the mouth it will be yes came into this world let's see carriers of that life inside of us what we needed amen was this message what we needed was the light it meant to struck the seed to bring forth what is in us and you think this morning that is a hard statement yes there are people with no seed in them they can sit in the presence of god and in the house of the lord amen no dramatizing if it will never ever ever ever take place because there is no seed amen to quicken there's nothing in there yes can you find them tomorrow they would just visit us in and out and some of them gave us hard time and we give we concentrate so much should have given so much attention only to find out they're not even one of us but we treat everybody as if they are we will go out there and preach this message to everyone amen as if they are because we don't know who's seed and who's here amen hallelujah we will only identify you by your response to the message remember you respond to the word for the hour amen something inside of you says amen something inside of you say the world amen behind me the cross before me amen just put up everything and follow jesus christ that should be the name of the lord i want you to notice that nothing could happen on the earth without christ moving yeah amen but all that spirit moving on the waters nothing could happen it had there had to be a movement and that movement was orderly that's the god that we serve amen and nothing will happen to you unless god moves amen and god if you're a seal of god you move once you might deny reject and turn your back but because you just see the moves again yes and to summon move seven times eight times amen because you'll receive finally amen you will come amen hallelujah and to some it just moves one yes and there was nothing in there and you'll never never return yeah you'll never move again hallelujah let's take a quote again number two is yeah and what does it take to make the christian life now i want you to notice in the beginning when god our father looked over this bleak earth and it wasn't nothing but one great big ball of water and god sent the holy spirit to the earth that logos that went out of god and he began to brood over the earth amen now the word brood means to make love hallelujah god brewed over you amen the first thing you experience what's the love of god you change the violence sinner and you look at your mistakes you look at your fault he says there's no hope for me and god comes around and he says i love you my child hallelujah amen he tells you amen that's what i died for thank you i paid the ultimate price for your forgiveness and you sense amen there's a love amen and the brother you could not withstand and you have to just agree and accept and follow jesus christ oh just like the dove you cool and the great holy spirit over the earth as a mental picture we're going to make it uh like wings with his great wings around the earth a brooding making love cooing come on come the father has ordained you come i'm coming to perform what the father's word is said is he talking in i have come to manifest what the father has spoken amen that's why i read luke chapter luke 15 when a prodigal son left home yes and he went to spend all he had he got involved in the world and he was covered in complete darkness but you see that did not make him less a son yes oh yes yes where we were before we met the lord jesus christ amen my sons covered with complete darkness yes some worse than others but brother sister when the word of god came and the spirit moved amen in our little uh uh where we were amen we decided we some of us did not even by through a pastor or anybody something in our hearts this is not where i belong something tells us amen we have a home somewhere amen something tells us amen we have a father somewhere amen i'm going to stand up and i'm going to tell father father i i i've sinned before thee and i've sinned before heaven and i'm not worthy to be called your son make me one of your servants and and reverend says it's impossible for the son to become a servant god doesn't demote whether yes son is father's blood running in your veins doesn't matter what you've done i want to tell you this morning church it doesn't matter what you have done god never writes off the sun amen god never rises amen what mistakes we've made in our lives amen come and confess god only forgive confessions amen i don't take it for granted god knows amen i want to make you come and make right and tell him you are so sorry amen hallelujah if your son or daughter of god hallelujah god restores lament and place you positionally once again hallelujah amen that's the god that we serve amen amen the reason why god is going to judge this earth in the message communion problem says they rejected god's provision amen spoke to a woman and explained to her what happened amen in palestinia palestinian he says amen when a man invites you for supper for lunch to his home a man says there's a procedure when you come to man's house amen there's a footwash flunky outside he says the the the host knows where you come from the host knows the path that you were traveling he says you there was no casino in our days and all that he said the donkeys and cattle and everything used the same part amen that you uh were using and your your long penis palestinian garment will pick up all the dust and the muck and you smell like the animals amen and you covered with the dust and that is why he made provision he invited you a nice clean home but you're not gonna come in there with all the dirt amen and he knows you can't carry water all the way so he made provision hallelujah and then they put a footwash clunky there and washes your feet amen and then you enter in i mean there's somebody that perfumes you amen change your sandals and give you another set of garments and then hallelujah you meet the host yes and you know what the host was not going to hug you amen while you were smiling out there amen but now that you're inside he embraces you and he welcomes you and he says amen that is exactly a mental pattern and he allows the pastor to wash you amen he come down himself and he becomes the footwork flanking the longest job hallelujah and he humbles himself and he cleans you thank you he washes you thank you forgive you amen and he says come and die in the master calling amen amen now you may feast at jesus table all the time why amen you are you are your perfumed or the holy ghost hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord amen thank you thank you amen brood and after a while they began to come some petroleum moving across the earth and a little bit of this and that and a little easterly he comes up in the earth he called the easter lily first after god blew them over the earth what was the first thing that pushes forth and pushes through that is the lily he is the lily of the belly amen brewed over hallelujah life the first thing that breaks through amen is that lily of the bed reaching for amen to lift you up out of that muck blessed be the name of the lord what brought it the holy spirit brooding then come along amen the dahlias and and the azaleas and the other bushes then along come the vegetation the holy spirit brooding then along came after the vegetation came the trees then the plant life then after a while the birds began to fly from the dust of the earth amen the holy spirit brooding them together and send them into the air amen then along can be animal life and the holy spirit's still breathing god's order hallelujah amen amen before god if he hated the fish put the fin on his back he make sure there's water for the man he's not walking back to front yes amen you see the sin today god knew but this great plan of redemption amen was in progress yes hallelujah already made provision the lamb of god before the foundation of the thank you lord then what happened paragraph 43 the same message what does it what does it take to make the christian life then what happened along came human life all of our bodies was all laying right there on the earth at that time amen my my mind if we come from the earth and we do and our bodies are made by the earth we are the dead substance of dead cattle and dead sheep and fish get beans and dead potatoes and dead wheat the stuff that we eat multiply cells and make us what we are we are from the earth that is what we are amen we love on dead substance everything here must die for us to love yes hallelujah that help us it multiplies the cells but he continue he says we love because something died if you don't love today if you don't eat dead substance you can't love our natural life is only by dead substance we eat fish the fish die if we eat beef the cow dies if we eat bread the weed die something has to die so we physically can live again because we are substance of the earth and that's the way we take in the substance to keep us alive and if something had to die so we could love physically again why not this immortal soul hallelujah something had to die so that a good love so that you could love eternally amen the flower has perpetual life for its year for a purpose of beauty we have a motto amen amen amen so if something had to die so that you can love amen naturally something had to die spiritually yeah so that you can love spiritually and john said behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sins of the world amen he came and he paid the ultimate price amen so you and i can love yes amen except that invitation church amen hallelujah that's the mind of god what was the first thing that came forth and is the it was born out of distress it was born out of distress and i think that's how a christian comes to the lord is not easy yeah hallelujah it's a fighting is a battle even and satan don't want to to let loose and he reminds you now and then where you come from what you did and all that out of distress but brother sister just tell him every time when he tell you where you come from tell him where he's going hallelujah quote number three quickly there's a man here that can turn on the light now when you see his word being vindicated in other words made known prove that is the light of the spoken word and without light nothing can live without the light there is no life upon the earth today that but what has to come by the light of the sun in in a bottley life and so forth and there is no eternal life outside of the son of god he is the light amen amen somebody don't have jesus christ amen is walking down yes amen hallelujah now we find out i believe as we study now and then and this light the earth was without form some people argue today in our schools and so forth about the world being the world being so many million years old and trying to condemn the bible and say it's wrong they just don't and never read the bible that's all because the bible don't tell us how old the world is the bible said in the beginning god we hated the heavens and the earth period and well how that we don't know now that's the first and that is period that's the end of the sentence in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth it might have been a hundred million billions of years or whether it was and whatever it was and how he done it that's up to him to know see not to me amen but the world well the earth was without form and void and the waters was upon the earth and god said it moved he moved upon the waters and said let there be light now i believe that the sun and so forth was already in existence i believe the moon as it goes on genesis chapter 3 to explain it but i believe what was here that the world we was going to use and and and it moved in there was form and mess all over the earth making it dark and god says let there be light and the darkness faded away amen and there was a cloudless sky man amen the powerful word of almighty god around the sky hallelujah there's only one thing that can get rid of the darkness in our lives that is the word for our day yes amen you thank god for the form and the letter reign that god has said amen the former rain is there the teaching reign [Music] the important church in the almost coming one season as the prophet says in our age hallelujah the former and letter and the elected reign is to mature yes but i tell you without the teaching reign amen you cannot have the faith yes amen it is the message of the hour amen the former ray brothers says that gives you that faith he says where does the rapture in faith lies he says he lies in the spoken word he said these seven thunders will give you rapturing whereas the fate lies amen the former reign the teachings amen of what god has given us in this day revelations 10 7. that is why amen when we go out into the world amen and teach this gospel amen we can't go out there without revelations yes amen we can't go out there without the former raven tell them amen hallelujah it's not just a denominational amen pool ain't meant to get numbers because god amen that's a number he's man he just weighs them and we go out there we tell them brother sister amen there is a god and that which you know remember god has sent us a prophet hallelujah god has sent us a message which is different amen to the world out there amen and then god started to move over the person's life what is this man talking about amen something breaks him on the inside hallelujah amen and he exposes himself to the message and he reads message after message even he gets the teachings and creates the faith in him hallelujah even for the changing of the lord amen brother says to expose yourself to the messenger of the lord amen a service on wednesday and on sunday is not enough you have to go into your closet amen brothers new craft dude just dig into the

yourself to truth amen amen amen okay we're coming to a close fourth quotation here quickly and i believe that god's way of doing things in the bible the next verse says the fourth verse and he prepared the light for he he separated the light from the darkness and the light he called day and the darkness he called night and god's word always separates light from darkness it's the word that does the separation see it's the word that does the separation amen amen man has got a tendency to influence people and say no that is the work of the enemy the complete separation from between light and darkness must be the word of god if the word draws you the word will keep amen amen i think one of the brothers prayed this morning lord we thank you that our meeting plays amen it's not in another country or meeting places in the world israel's safety zone and meeting places and homeland but ours is in the word of god amen god ever does god ever does the same thing when he gets ready to use anything like he got ready to use this old style or whatever it was this world he had to separate the light from darkness when he gets ready to leave to use a group of people he has to separate the light from darkness when he gets ready to use an individual he he separates the light from darkness amen yes sir separation comes god wants to use an individual use a church he has to bring separation to darkness hallelujah light comes by god remember the light come by the spoken word the word of god said let there be light when there was no light and he sent the light to separate the darkness amen from the light the word of command cleared the sky so the sun could shine in and his word today is that the one that clears back all amen of the atmosphere of unbelief i believe his darkness yes amen and we pray this morning that god will just amen clear the unbelief yes hallelujah so that the world can shine forth in our lives yes amen there's only two things one thing that can get rid of darkness in our life that is the word for our day yes not yesterday's world when god wants to use anything or anybody he has to bring a separation from darkness amen the seed was already there says the prophet the new birth did not give you the seed it was already there then he says in the fourth seal he says well we've got evidence and can prove that the world is a million years old i said that didn't have anything to do with it in genesis 1 1 he said in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth that's all now the world without form and void and i said i believe every seed was laying right there from some other civilization or something my goodness [Music] the seeds was under the water was already there they see this side of you from some civilization amen you come from the thoughts of god wherever you don't know we suffer from amnesia we can't even remember where we come from amen but we thank god the message amen open our understanding amen amen today we can truly say i come from god yes amen and i'm going back together amen there's only the second that can mention those kind of things yes we come from god and we're going back amen when we moved over our lives amen some of us in denominations some of us amen serving all different gods and stuff out there amen that this message came our way amen you just speak up something inside of us yeah it's grace amen i think this morning amen as we enter this new year let's thank god for his grace yes amen amen you didn't choose him amen no we are running away from the presence of god he shows us amen hallelujah today because of election amen we look to the full knowledge of god amen we realized all this was because of the four knowledge amen and the four knowledge of god directs him point us to destination yes hallelujah amen amen if he doesn't know the future then he's not god if he doesn't know the past is not god amen hallelujah he's omnipotent hallelujah he knows all things amen amen i want you to trust him amen i'm gonna say this morning there's a few things that this omnipotent god can't do they say when you have no omnipotent you can do all things but there's this omnipotent god there's a few things you can't do you can't lie amen [Music] yes yes the god that we serve is real amen amen he's a present day god amen his alpha is omega that's god hallelujah god bless us this morning amen [Music] why are you skipping out the other things it's a hot place up here did you ever notice now he's referring to heaven but it was speaking before him how a sea goes into the ground many seas are there in the ground when god move upon the water with the light and light brought forth the first presence of god spoken light came by god's spoken word and god's word is the only thing that still brings a light and when the waters went back the seed was already in the earth and the light only brought forth the seeds that remained with germ in them comfort and making his creation and now on easter morning there was another light struck the earth and when the holy spirit was given and it's given to bring life to those seeds that god by his foreknowledge knew that would be here on the earth as he knew the first natural sea he knows where the spiritual seeds are amen your body was laying here right then on the earth when god first brought the earth into existence we are a part of the earth we are laying there and buys for knowledge he knew exactly who would love him and who would serve him and who would not he's for knowledge a man tells amy that if it doesn't then he isn't god right he can't be god without being infinite and if he's infinite he knows all things amen hallelujah amen jacob and my love and eso have i hated long before they were even born amen what does that the full knowledge of god amen amen and even i told the church and even through life today if you read amen the god of abraham isaac and esau doesn't doesn't sound right he had to be the god of
