========================================

prayer. Amen. How many of you ready for the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, let's empty out our cup so we can fill in. Amen. Now, remember, we've been teaching a bit and going on a series, so we'll just take off from there. Amen. So, we'll turn to our Bibles. We'll go to Revelation chapter 10. Praise the Lord. We started on Sunday. We Amen. continued on Wednesday. We just take it a bit further today. Amen. Praise the Lord. Now pray amen that the Holy Spirit will make things more clear for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that we can recognize our day and our message. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So Revelation chapter 10, we'll read from verse one. There it says, "And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud." Now we must know if we are in the message of the hour that that mighty angel was Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says that was Christ descending. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says only Christ that could be &gt;&gt; right. And he's coming with that open book. Remember he's the same one in another form. Took that book. &gt;&gt; When it was in the hand, Amen. of the one seated on the throne. He came out of the sanctuary. He took that book and now he's bringing this title deed back to the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we got to identify this angel &gt;&gt; coming down from heaven clothed with a cloud. Now we know that the cloud was seven angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon is saying seven angels formed that cloud. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's being clothed. He's surrounded by seven angels. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And a rainbow was upon his head. So now he's a covenant angel. &gt;&gt; We know rainbow speaks of covenant. And his face were as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and cried with a loud voice. Now he's got a message. The messenger, any angel has a message. So this messenger has a message. He cries with a loud voice as when a lion roarth. But now his message is tied to something else. He says, "And when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write. So he didn't write anything. He was about to write. And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, "Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not." Amen. Praise the Lord. The Lord had blessings to the reading of his word. You may be seated. Amen. So we've been saying that if we can't recognize our day and its message, our time and our season, we won't know how to prepare adequately for the time that we are living in now. Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. The bride has had a revival. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride is not looking for a coming revival. &gt;&gt; The opening of the word is our revival. &gt;&gt; So these are the things we ought to be excited about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And a revival should not we shouldn't allow a revival to die. We were speaking on Wednesday about the Welsh revival. &gt;&gt; We baron says once a revival passes you can't bring it back. &gt;&gt; So the 1904 Welsh revival has passed. But the point we were trying to make that the revival could not be seen physically with eyes. The revival in fact the man was standing next to the person where the revival was in and he asked him where's the revival &gt;&gt; and he said I am the Welsh revival. &gt;&gt; So people are looking for now remember the Pentecostals had a revival under Isuza Street &gt;&gt; and they were the revival was in there. Now, if we are in this time and season looking for a revival, we as the bride must say, "This is the bride's revival. &gt;&gt; I am the bride's revival." &gt;&gt; Amen. So, we've got to have a fire shut up within our bones. &gt;&gt; Amen. We've got to be excited about what we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to be enthused about what we believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, the then we were trying to show Amen. how that there came a time in brother Brandham's life when him as a seven church age messenger his ministry had completed. &gt;&gt; Now if you go to Revelation chapter 2 you'll see the the Lord the angel is telling John to write unto the angel of the church of Ephesus until the angel of the church of Smyrna until the angel to every angel he must write. Amen. &gt;&gt; So unto the angel of the Ladyians, that's William &gt;&gt; Brham. &gt;&gt; Write to him. &gt;&gt; So the seventh angel has a message. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now watch if we go to our first quote there, brother Josh. He says, "Now watch, don't forget this now as we go. But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, so he's trying to describe who the seventh angel is. He says that last angel, earthly angel. Then he says this angel. Now remember he's he's drawing the distinction between Revelation 101 angel and 107 angel. Now he's talking about 101 angel. He says this angel came down from heaven. It wasn't him. &gt;&gt; He come from heaven. Right? So that is speaking in the first seal. Then we'll go to the next quote there and we'll see this is now in the in he says this angel come down from heaven. The other seven angels of the seven churches was earthly messengers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But this angel all the message is finished. The seventh angel winds up the whole thing. &gt;&gt; So what is he trying to say? Late year is now over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pentecost is over. &gt;&gt; Time for a new message. &gt;&gt; Time for now to call out the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He's been building up the pyramid, building up the church. Amen. Restoring the bride. But now, how excited heaven must be? &gt;&gt; How excited are we on the earth? Amen. Because now there's a message for an end time people to welcome back Christ on the earth. &gt;&gt; So he says the seventh angel winds up the whole thing. And this angel comes not to the earth. He isn't a man from the earth as the messengers to the church ages. That's finished. But this angel brings the next announcement. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This angel is coming for marriage. &gt;&gt; This angel is coming to unite with a people. &gt;&gt; This angel is coming now to bring present tense conditions on the earth. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. He brings the next announcement. And an angel means a messenger. &gt;&gt; So which means his message is not come out of all my people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Be not partakers of a sin. That's William Brandham's message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This angel is not going to rebuke them and talk to you about their dressing. &gt;&gt; This angel is That's the seven church age message. Amen. That's his message telling them you're blind. You are wretched. You're poor. You are naked. Why don't you come and buy yourself? &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the seventh angel's message. &gt;&gt; That's directly from the Bible. &gt;&gt; So he's warning them, dress right, live right, act right, do right &gt;&gt; because Christ is coming. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says here an angel means a messenger and he comes down from heaven clothed in that pillar of light cloud with a rainbow over his head and a rainbow is a covenant. It was Christ. &gt;&gt; So here he is confirming Revelation 10:1 angel he is Christ. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. With one foot on land, one on sea and swore time will be no more. Where are we at, sir? What What's all this about? I'm asking you. The other angels were messengers, men of the earth. But this angel &gt;&gt; to the angel of the church of ladies here, to the angel of the church of Ephesus, messengers of the earth, men, messengers, prophets, and so forth come to the church. But this one didn't come from the earth. &gt;&gt; He come down from heaven because the mystery is all finished. &gt;&gt; If we're still wondering what the mystery is, the mystery was finished. The seventh angel went off the earth, but it's time for the mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; And when the mystery is finished, the angel said, "Time shall be no more." And seven thunders throw their voices out. What if it is something to let us know how to enter into rapturing faith? &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. &gt;&gt; Is it? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I say yes. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Will we run? Leap over walls. That means to leap over walls means to change dimensions. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is there something fixing to happen and these old wild bodies are going to be changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the message. Amen. To change our bodies. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, if you put up the first picture on that slide there, I'll show you the seven church age messengers of the earth. &gt;&gt; These are men of the earth. &gt;&gt; You can trace where they were born. You can trace Paul. He's called Paul of Tarsus. You can trace his earthly mother and father. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of these men had earthly mothers and fathers. &gt;&gt; These were earthly men given messengers. Ireneius. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can see Martin, Columba, Luther came out of Germany. Wesley came out of England. Brother Brandon came out of the USA. &gt;&gt; These are all earthly messengers. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you search up the history on Wikipedia, you can read about these men. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you go to Revelation 2:3, you can read about these men. &gt;&gt; These men had messengers through the church ages. God has been building up a church. &gt;&gt; And these were the messengers to those churches. &gt;&gt; Now listen how fortunate we are, church. The Bible says to write to the angel of the church of Ephesus doesn't give his name. &gt;&gt; But we sitting here today in 2025 can put a name to the angel of the church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Because the pyramid has been built up. &gt;&gt; We are all the way at the top now. &gt;&gt; We can look back down through the ages and see how God has been working building up the church. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Can you imagine living in Paul's age? You wouldn't have known all the other messengers to come. But here we are right at the top now with a big eye view. Amen. We can look down through the church ages and see how God was working. Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. When Satan thought he had defeated the church, God still had a people coming through. God still had a message for each age. &gt;&gt; Now, let me show you the one that was not from the earth. Amen. Put up the next picture. These are the earthly seven, but this one is a heavenly messenger. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But the Bible says this one didn't come from the earth. He came down from heaven. That's Jesus Christ. He's here. He is the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. For those of you looking for the rapture, the rapture has already started. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. We are already in the shout. Amen. We are already caught up. We are already translated. Amen. We are already caught up in our portion of the word. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; People are looking and saying, "Oh, we're waiting, waiting, waiting." What are you waiting for? &gt;&gt; You're supposed to be in the cycle of you're not waiting for it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That's why we are revived. That's why there's a joy in our soul because the heavenly messenger is on the earth now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. This one, you can't find his father. &gt;&gt; Wonderful Lord. &gt;&gt; The other seven churches, you can go to Wikipedia and find his father and mother. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you put up Hebrews chapter 7 there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 7 maybe verse three. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh glory. We'll find out where his father and mother is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Without father &gt;&gt; without mother, &gt;&gt; without descent, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto the son of God, abided a priest continually. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. This is God Almighty come down for what? For marriage. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's come to unite with the church. But there's only a special class of people called to unite with the headstone. &gt;&gt; Paul wasn't called to unite with the headstone. &gt;&gt; Ireelius wasn't called to unite with the headstone. Neither were the seven church age messengers called to unite with the headstone because the headstone must come and unite with a living people. &gt;&gt; So don't think that you are just a casual observer in the message. You are called here to meet the headstone to match the headstone to fit so perfectly with the headstone. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. We are just not ordinary people on the earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were perfectly designed. Amen. Do you know when Solomon was building the the temple, they had stones cut from all around the world. &gt;&gt; And they play brought them to Amen. the city of David there. And they placed them out and there was no cutting. He says there was not a sound of a buzz saw, &gt;&gt; not a sound of chisel, no cutting. &gt;&gt; It was perfectly cut. &gt;&gt; All they were doing was fitting and fitting and fitting. We have been cut for an end time age. Amen. We were not caught for the Pentecostal age. We were not cut for any other age. We were cut for the bride age. Amen. At the end of all time, &gt;&gt; in fact, they wouldn't have known what to do with your peace if they saw your peace in the other ages. &gt;&gt; They would have left you aside like they left that headstone, the cornerstone. They left him aside. They didn't know what to do with it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You were not built for another time and season. You were not built to be thrown to lions. You were not built to go through persecution, to be sword as thunder. You were called to rise above the the conditions of this age. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, brother Brandham says here in the message influence, he says, I must decrease. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He must increase. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So watch how you got your levels. &gt;&gt; When you are setting your levels between I must decrease and I must increase. Watch who you got bigger. &gt;&gt; If you have the seventh angel as as the increase and the the Revelation 10:1 angel as a decrease, something is wrong with your picture. &gt;&gt; He says, "I must decrease." &gt;&gt; Amen. and he must increase. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God can't have two on earth at the same time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to give you straight from the court. So, you can't say I am telling you something. &gt;&gt; The plan himself is preaching it. But these things are overlooked. &gt;&gt; The deity teaching came into the message &gt;&gt; and people look more to the man &gt;&gt; and forget the one that is here. &gt;&gt; Glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'll say this again. If you want Brother Brandham as your seven church age messenger, then you're still stuck in &gt;&gt; Leia. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He is a messenger to the latest. &gt;&gt; I am not a Leosian. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; I am not a Leian. Neither am I a bread might. &gt;&gt; My name is Jesus. &gt;&gt; Call me Jesus. &gt;&gt; That's my married name. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why you can go up to any demon and tell them, "I come in the name of Jesus. My name is Jesus. That's my married name." Amen. You've got to leave in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch now. He says, "God can't have two on the earth at the same time. Only one has the message." &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; Only one has the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I must decrease. He is the messenger. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; I've been up to this time. Now, if you if you got the pyramid there, you can put it up. Amen. He says, I've been up to this time. &gt;&gt; Right now, he takes my place. &gt;&gt; Oh yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, leave that quote there. Let's let's just read this. I've been up to this time. Now, he's talking about the seven church age later this year. I've been up to this time. Then he says, "Now he takes my place." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know some of you don't want to read this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Some of you don't want to read this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; He takes my place. &gt;&gt; As Elisha, when Elijah went up and throwed back his robe to Elisha, his ministry was finished. Elisha must must take up where he left off. He must increase. I must decrease. Is quoting John the Baptist. So he says be conscious of your littleness. &gt;&gt; You are nothing. &gt;&gt; I wish you had a mirror in front of you so you can tell yourself I am nothing. &gt;&gt; I am nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. If there's any good to be found in me, it is Christ in me, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. It's not me that doeth the work. If I go up to a brother and I cast out that demon of sickness, if I cast out something, Amen. It's not I that doeth the work, but the father that dwelleth in me. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; He's saying you sound like you're speaking like in the first person like you're Jesus. Well, that's what it's all about. &gt;&gt; In that day you shall know as I was in the father, the father in me, I in you, you in me? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory. Somebody give him praise. Amen. Somebody give him praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. Didn't Jesus say, Amen. The next quote, brother. Didn't Jesus say in the last days, Matthew 24:24, that the two would be so close it would deceive the very genes predestinated, the elected ones, if it was possible. &gt;&gt; You see, my genetics, you know, there are certain genetics that are uh are prone to receive sicknesses and diseases. &gt;&gt; But this genetics, &gt;&gt; wonderful, &gt;&gt; it has an immune system that can resist deception. My God, &gt;&gt; my immune system is built to resist deception, &gt;&gt; to resist the lie of the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. What he's saying here, he says the predestinated, the very genes predestinated elected ones, if it was possible, they can be deceived. But I'm designed in such a way that I can't be deceived. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The virus of deception comes and my body rejects it. My soul rejects it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. He says almost. It looks almost like the real thing. So in the last days, it's we time now. &gt;&gt; It's getting harvest time. This is not Luther's age. This is not Pentecost age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; This is not the Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; What is he saying it is? &gt;&gt; It is the bride's age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. As Moses called a nation out of a nation, Christ today is calling church out of a church. You see the same thing in type, taking them to the glorious eternal promised land. Amen. He says now to refuse that person that's doing the calling, Christ, &gt;&gt; no matter if you're Pentecostal, Methodist, Luther, whatever you are, you got to this age, nothing against them, not at all. But in this age now, you've got to accept like they did in that age, the person of Christ, which is the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, I must clarify something here. It's so close that sometimes in the days of William Brandham, Luke 17:30 was in operation. &gt;&gt; This mighty angel that came down needed a body to walk through. &gt;&gt; So, he he used the body of William Brandham. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you're going to hear the mystery of God that the that last age message for the bride is coming through this prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he's using that body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's using that vessel. &gt;&gt; But you can't confuse who the messenger is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, in this time and season, the body of William Brandom is in the grave. &gt;&gt; His soul is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the orphan body. Yes. &gt;&gt; But then the mighty angel must find another group of people to tabernacle and walk through. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hear what he says. Now the next one, according to God's word, the seventh messenger will finish. The seventh message will be finished. And then the seventh Sunday. &gt;&gt; And he saw the capstone rolled over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. So which means brother if you put up the picture of the pyramid there you'll see here. What is he saying there? So the seven thunders can't come in the legacy in church age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you put up the picture you put up on Wednesday. This one doesn't have the headstone. Amen. Praise the Lord. The seven thunders are coming out of the headstone. &gt;&gt; Now, the headstone is a very special place. &gt;&gt; It's a very special ministry for a special class of people. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's the eagle age. &gt;&gt; That's the heavenly places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's where the bride is caught up now. The bride was caught up. Amen. out of the lady in church age she was the shout came forth to call her into the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now many people don't want to take this responsibility to be in the headstone to welcome back Christ on the earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because it requires you to die to yourself. &gt;&gt; Civilingum surname needs to die &gt;&gt; and you need to take the surname of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So no matter what you are, you got to come to that state where brother Brandham says, "I am not the son of Charles and Ella Brham." &gt;&gt; What does that mean? You are denying earthly &gt;&gt; lineage. &gt;&gt; And you're tying back to your heavenly lineage. &gt;&gt; And you're saying, "My father is God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's move on now. So Ephesians 1:10 is calling. He says if you're putting it down, Ephesians 1:10 is not a dispensation, not the seventh day. It's called the fullness of time. &gt;&gt; When the fullness of time has come, when that time has been fulfilled, when there is no more time, then you go into eternity after the seven church age is over. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So what he's saying, Luther's age is over. Methodist age is over. Pentecost age is over. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So which means then what? Now you're going into what? So you mean we are in the blending of time to eternity? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because if you're wondering where we are right now. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; If you're thinking that all things are continuing in the same brother Brandon fell asleep, you are sorely mistaken. &gt;&gt; We are in the time in the time right now. The blending &gt;&gt; of time to eternity. &gt;&gt; We are caught in between. Amen. We are caught into heavenly places. We are caught up into the shout. Amen. We are caught up in this place now waiting the translation of our bodies. What are we waiting for then? &gt;&gt; We are waiting just for the last one to come into the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are waiting for the last one to come into the headstone. &gt;&gt; Because if you put up the pyramid again, Amen. This age couldn't be finished till everyone that was everyone that was called in godliness was there. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; The age couldn't end till everyone that was called under that age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Under Wesley's age was in there. &gt;&gt; Then the age could be sealed. &gt;&gt; And then starts 1906. &gt;&gt; Then the age could open up. Yes. &gt;&gt; Then the seventh church age couldn't end till everyone that was called under the seventh angel &gt;&gt; was in. &gt;&gt; Now that we up in the headstone, &gt;&gt; the rapture can't take place till everyone that's called up to be in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Because the headstone is not complete without every single one that's supposed to be there predestinated to be in the headstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And we are praying that there just maybe one or two more pieces. one or two more people to be caught up into the headstone. &gt;&gt; And it could be that they're not out in the world. &gt;&gt; It could be that they are in the message of the hour, but they're caught up with a Ladyian thinking and a Ladyian mentality, not realizing that they are supposed to be all the way up where Christ is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So how many of you are reading this and you are you are finding out the Pentecostal age is over according to brother Brandon &gt;&gt; Pentecostal age is over now you go into eternity he says Christ has again centered himself like that cap of the pyramid so whereas Christ centered himself now remember that's just a picture and an illustration so that's why he's saying Christ has centered himself like the cap &gt;&gt; like that picture you are seeing. &gt;&gt; Christ has centered himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost, then the coming of the cap. What is it? The Holy Ghost bunch being honed out. Horned means shaped, &gt;&gt; right? So it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away. &gt;&gt; Now, that puts a big obligation on you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. Are you listening to what the prophet is saying? &gt;&gt; We must match the kind of ministry Jesus had when he went away. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; When he comes back, it'll catch the whole thing in the rapture where the justified, sanctified, the and baptism of the Holy Ghost. That pyramid will stand again. The house of God will live again. The tree of life is growing again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, you get it? Those people who died in there are depending, waiting on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. through seven church ages they are waiting on us. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you had to go into that sixth dimension right now and ask them what are you waiting for? They'll say I am waiting on you. &gt;&gt; So this church has got to come to perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now perfection is only in Christ. Come on. Can we say amen to that? So which means we need to get into Christ. &gt;&gt; This church has got to come into perfection in order to bring the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they under sold under the altar waiting for the church to come to its perfection that when Christ does come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this church you see is coming smaller into the minority. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it says there brother Brham refers to his chalkboard drawing right. It's a whole lot sharper than this. But just like to write that across here, it comes to a needle point. So, put up that other picture there that we had on the Are you seeing what brother Brandon is saying here? It's a whole lot sharper, right? But just like to like to write that cross there. It comes to a needle point. Now, pay attention to what he's saying now because the diagram we have is not a correct diagram. He's saying right here at the top, &gt;&gt; it's not a flat surface. &gt;&gt; The Pentecostal age doesn't end in a flat surface like that. &gt;&gt; There's a people who have been called out of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; He says it comes to a needle point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, you can't use cement to put the capstone on there. &gt;&gt; He says it's got to fit so perfectly. &gt;&gt; It's got to be owned. H O N E D. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That when it comes, it fits perfectly where you can't even fit a razor blade. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what is going to blend Jesus Christ and the Legacy and Church Age? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What is the group of people that must fit in between them? Didn't we just read the Holy Ghost bunch? &gt;&gt; Did we put that quote up just now? the one before that. Did you not see that? &gt;&gt; Now, if maybe I'm going slow down a bit. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. If you if you if you'll just see that he says it's the Holy Ghost bunch, right? How many of you can see the Holy Ghost bunch being honed out &gt;&gt; so that it can &gt;&gt; so which means between the latestans and Christ coming there's a group of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. that's being honed out to a needle point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To welcome the coming edstone. Are we reading correctly? &gt;&gt; Now we can see. Pay attention to this quote. I wish we had two screens so we can put two side by side because now if you put back the pyramid picture, not this one, the other one. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brandham, this is not the picture that brother Brandham had in the church. You know, in between brother Brandon got Holy Ghost that between brotherly kindness and love. &gt;&gt; Now, can you see that the that Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost bunch &gt;&gt; because you're going to see I'll show you a diagram just now how the pyramid really looks. It doesn't end on a flat surface like that. &gt;&gt; Because if the headstone comes, it can slide off. &gt;&gt; And God's not going to use any cement. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to that quote now. We'll read it again. Not this one. We were reading in Statue of Perfect Man, paragraph 368. Amen. And this church you see is coming smaller into a minority. It's a whole lot sharper than that. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon is talking about that flat surface. He's saying, "No, no, it's a whole lot sharper than that. It's a whole lot sharper than that because it's come up to a needle point." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Up the church in the minority. He has got to get into a place until it's the same kind of ministry that this left because when this headstone comes back, it's got a little pocket like here, the pocket. Now, it's got a pocket that it can fit into. Now, let's let's uh read this very slowly, right? Go back one paragraph. How will we put the headstone? How will we put Jesus Christ coming back? Brother Brandham is giving it away here. He says it comes to the needle point until the church in the minority has got to get into the place it's the same kind of ministry &gt;&gt; that this left. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see how we get to the needle point. &gt;&gt; We can't make statements we at the needle point where the needle point then we don't match the ministry. &gt;&gt; He is saying we come to the needle point when we match the ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody is clear with that. &gt;&gt; That's how we are being honed, shaped. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must match the ministry of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. It's coming in the minority to get into that place until it's the same kind of ministry that this left because when this headstone comes back, it's got a little pocket like here where it's going to sit right in there on the regular pyramid. It isn't just a cap that sits across the top. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother Brand. I'm saying it now. It isn't just Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It isn't just a cap that sits across the top. It's a little flange. &gt;&gt; How many of you know what a flange is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you seen a flange? &gt;&gt; Who here knows what a flange is? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's got a flange. It must fit perfectly in the flange so it can't slide off. It's got to sit on there cuz it sheds the water. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; And when it comes, this church has got to be honed. All these rest the stones of the pyramid are laying so perfect till you can't run a razor blade between them weighing tons laying in there. How they got them up, they don't know. But but they were built. &gt;&gt; And up here when the pyramid cap does come, the pyramid itself, the body of Christ will have to be honed. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only just some creed or doctrine or something. You see what he's saying? Not just straightening out your creeds and your doctrines. &gt;&gt; Not just straightening out your guardian, &gt;&gt; but you got to match Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Not just let's read. Brother Brandon, I help you. How many of you believe the prophet? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because we get so excited we don't have their creeds and their dogmas. &gt;&gt; He's saying not just that, &gt;&gt; not just some creed or doctrine or something other we come through. It'll have to be so perfectly like &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Till when he comes, he and that ministry will fit right smack together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then will come the rapture, the going home. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I say we at the pinnacle now &gt;&gt; where this ministry is matching Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And next will come the rapture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Time to go home. &gt;&gt; Which what what we mean is the when we saying the rapture which means the dead in Christ must rise &gt;&gt; because the rapture is already in progress with a shout &gt;&gt; calling us out. We are talking about the next phase of the rapture which is the calling out of the dead in Christ. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's put that next uh picture up. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, let's put that pyramid picture up. So, what he's saying now on that PowerPoint, remember what he's saying? It's not a flat surface like that, &gt;&gt; right? What did he say? It's got a flange. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know if you read that, you remember that. Now he said it's got a flange. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. So the headstone really looks like the next picture. &gt;&gt; Because this is the flange. &gt;&gt; Remember he said it must come to a needle point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this becomes the flange where when the headstone fits it can't slide. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, you're paying attention. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of you want to go back to Leia. I can see you sleeping. Hey, that's a legian spirit. Imagine if eagles sleep medall. &gt;&gt; If you're sleeping, you lay to see &gt;&gt; blind and miserable. So the headstone, it's got a little pocket like here. Are we reading what the prophet said? &gt;&gt; You know what happened to that that plane in India? The engines went, it went off. &gt;&gt; You know, recently there was a plane that &gt;&gt; crashed. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We don't want you to crash midway through the service. &gt;&gt; We've been born for an eagle age. &gt;&gt; By an eagle prophet's message. This headstone it's got a little pocket like here. &gt;&gt; This is directly the prophet now just that nobody drew the diagram properly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. You all can say amen to that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So which means the pyramid really looks like the next one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wow. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Because the church has got to be honed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The church has got to be owned. So which means we look more like capstone. &gt;&gt; But we are not called capstone. &gt;&gt; We are called top stone. &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me you're a top stone. Okay. When we read the quote and you see the prophet saying with the top stone, then you're going to say, "Okay, I can say it." You don't believe your pastor, you want to see it in black and white. It's fine. So, the church has got to be honed. It's a little flange. &gt;&gt; That's how we must finish. Needle point. Did we just read all of this? &gt;&gt; It's not just flat. Amen. &gt;&gt; The church that's called out must come to meet the headstone. How are we meeting him? By doing the same ministry like him. &gt;&gt; Are we making sense to the message? &gt;&gt; Are we understanding the message? &gt;&gt; So which means if we are not matching his ministry, we are nowhere near there. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. All we're doing is quoting we have we have the right doctrine. We have the right message. We have this. He's saying it's not just the doctrine. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So this is what the pyramid should look like. Why did brother Brandon draw it like that? That's where he is. Seven church age message &gt;&gt; ended. &gt;&gt; But we living in this day &gt;&gt; means we can update the picture a bit &gt;&gt; according to what he said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Using his words &gt;&gt; saying the church is going to be honed. &gt;&gt; It's a little flange. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the authorized people. &gt;&gt; There's no one more qualified or authorized to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the headstone must fit perfectly. You can't use cement. You can't use any other glue. &gt;&gt; It must fit perfectly. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We're doing good for time. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. So he says, I have referred to this. I don't know whether I ever did it at the tabernacle or not. You notice the dollar bill, that great seal, how you could say the United States could recognize that over in Egypt they have a great seal. And here's a seal of the United States one side the eagle. Why would they be forced to make that great seal, the great seal? Because if you notice right behind up above the pyramid, there's a little block. And that little block is the headstone. And that headstone was never put on the pyramid. It's an open top. If you ever been there, now you see why he's saying the headstone is not put on the pyramid. But when we look at the pyramid, we think it's a complete pyramid. &gt;&gt; But what we are seeing is the needle point. &gt;&gt; Okay. Come on. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What we are seeing on the pyramid in Egypt is the needle point. And we think that's got a capstone. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says the capstone was never put on the pyramid. I got a little pyramid top here. You see? You think this is the pyramid? &gt;&gt; This is the capstone. &gt;&gt; It must fit. &gt;&gt; Fit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it almost looks like the pyramid is coming on top of pyramid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It must fit. What is that? The marriage of the lamb. &gt;&gt; The two becoming one. &gt;&gt; Revelation 19:7. The marriage of the lamb is come. &gt;&gt; His wife had made herself ready. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The wife must fit and match. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; She must be clothed in the wedding garment that he sent for her. &gt;&gt; The word of God. &gt;&gt; So she comes up now standing there on that seventh step. You remember he says at the seventh step, there's a messenger to welcome you into the king's chamber. That was now our Eliza working among us to our king Christ. &gt;&gt; The coming of the headstone. By the way, you can make this automate this for me. &gt;&gt; It's easy to do this. Amen. You can make it with paper. Praise the Lord. Maybe they should do this in Sunday school. Make some pyramids for us. Praise the Lord. But this is the coming of the cap. &gt;&gt; Now, if you put it over a flat surface like this, she can move. &gt;&gt; Can you see? That is why brother Brandham is saying they didn't know what to do with the cornerstone. &gt;&gt; It wasn't fitting. It was sliding off everything. &gt;&gt; But in this time and season, there's a people designed to match it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To match Christ. &gt;&gt; Why? Through the word we receive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an open top. If you ever seen it, by the grace of God, there's no top on the pyramid. What is it? Enoch built it before the flood. Even that they don't know. &gt;&gt; Do you know only you know that Enoch built that pyramid? &gt;&gt; They don't know Enoch built the pyramid. &gt;&gt; It was im memorial. That's the reason it never destroyed during the time of the flood. There's nothing destroyed it because it's a memorial. &gt;&gt; All three Bibles of God &gt;&gt; are existent on the earth right now. God's first Bible, the heavens, you can still go out and see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God's second Bible, the pyramid. If you go to Egypt, you can see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God's Bible, &gt;&gt; written word is here. But we are living so privileged now. We are living in a time and season where the Bible has come out of the pages of the book. &gt;&gt; And you are living epistles read and known of all men. &gt;&gt; You become the walking living Bible. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Praise the Lord. Let's just continue. There's nothing destroyed it because it's a memorial. Now, if you notice way down at the bottom, it's wide. Then it shapes up a little more in the minority. Then a little more. Then it come goes to the headstone. That's the Lutheran church age. Justification in the church, sanctification, then baptism of the Holy Ghost. But as it shapes towards the top, it continues from Lutheran age wes into Pentecostal. But after it leaves the Pentecostal age, it still shapes up until it has to get to such a place till all the stones are so owned till a razor blade. Right? He's trying to say again, you can't even put a razor blade where mortar should be. That's in paragraph 120 now. Amen. &gt;&gt; They can't they take this razor blade and run it along. It's so owned up perfect until you can't even put a razor blade where mortar should be. That's how perfect the stones are put together. &gt;&gt; Amen. And now with this headstone which the stones dove tail in like this kind of set in in ways of angles so that the headstone will come in a point and set right down into it. It won't need any mortar. It'll set perfect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now that's what God is doing to his church is owning off his people of the people and making it such a perfect way that when the headstone Christ comes it fits the building together then the resurrection of the whole thing the church is gone up the headstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now we are sitting together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Where are we? This place is called the headstone up here to fit the headstone. This place is called heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Remember that needle point is going into the pyramid. &gt;&gt; So we are caught up in here waiting now for the next one to come in. For the next one to come in, take their place. Take their place. Take their place. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. The church has come from a great reformation of the Lutheran age, then through the Wesley age into the Pentecostal age. Now it's shaping up like the headstone in the pyramid. Are we reading this? &gt;&gt; Are we finally understanding it where we are? &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; What is he saying again? Through the Wesley age into the Pentecostal and now it's shaping up like in the headstone in the pyramid. &gt;&gt; We're shaping in here. &gt;&gt; Amen. But you say, "I can't see you." It's no longer I that livethle &gt;&gt; but Christ that liveth in me. &gt;&gt; You say, "I can't see you in there." You gone to a needle point. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't see us. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's shaping up like the headstone, the pyramid. Now, don't think I'm talking pyramid doctrine. I'm just showing example. Remember what we are saying. Forget just the picture of him. &gt;&gt; Become more like Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Match Christ's ministry matches what he did and then we are shaping up. Just showing an example how it has to fit so perfect because it's not cemented. It just dropped in there. &gt;&gt; Right. Next, the next one he uses different description. He says that church goes right out at the end. Right at the end of that, the church is going to have to be so perfectly like the ministry of Jesus Christ till when the stone comes, it sets right smack in the groove. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See, you like to be in the groove. &gt;&gt; You always wanted to be grooving. &gt;&gt; The prophet is saying you're in the groove. &gt;&gt; So don't think you're unpopular. &gt;&gt; You're the in thing and in for according to according to the world, you are out oldfashioned. You are outdated, &gt;&gt; but according to God, you are the latest version. &gt;&gt; You are the current flavor. &gt;&gt; You are the thing required for now, this time and season. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; If the world wants to hear from Jesus Christ, they've got to hear you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Once more, the world will hear from God as at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Why? The word is in the bride. &gt;&gt; Let's move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you're right smack in the groove. So when they tell you you're old fashioned, must tell him, "No, I'm in the groove." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they tell him you're outdated, you must say, "No, I'm in the groove." &gt;&gt; And you're quoting the prophet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now, if you're looking there at that at that pyramid again, put the last one we had up there on the PowerPoint. There are many people who claim to be So we know this was fifth church age 5 6 7 church age messengers people are claiming to be the eighth angel. How many of you know people claim to be eighth angel? &gt;&gt; Amen. If they tell you there's they believe in an eighth angel, you must have a conversation with them. Ask them who's your eighth angel? If they're pointing you to a messenger from the earth, &gt;&gt; oh yeah, &gt;&gt; then they are wrong. That's right. &gt;&gt; But if they are pointing you to a messenger from heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the messenger of this age is the mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So then you must tell them, "Sorry, brother. You got your cow eating grass on top of the tree." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the messengers of the earth are finished. &gt;&gt; Finished with William Branham. &gt;&gt; The messenger from heaven is the messenger of this age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yes. Become a part of the word. Now he's encouraging you. Become a part of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A part of the word of today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. In 2025, August 8th, become part of not August is is it or 10th. August 10th, become a part of the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Wonderful Lord. can't be part of the word for Moses day. &gt;&gt; That part is done made up. That was the feed. &gt;&gt; People want to walk in the footprints of the prophet. &gt;&gt; I want to hunt where he hunted. I want to sleep where he slept. I want to fish where he fished. What is he saying here? Can't be part of the word of Moses day. Who was our Moses? Hey, come on. &gt;&gt; We the third exodus. &gt;&gt; We had a prophet. &gt;&gt; The word prophet. &gt;&gt; He's saying can't be part of the word of Moses day. That part is done made up. Which means they done their ministry. &gt;&gt; They in the kingdom secure. That part is done made up. That was the feed. We at the &gt;&gt; Everybody say we at the &gt;&gt; This is &gt;&gt; I know some people's reflex time is a bit longer. That's why I'm waiting. Right. Let's read it again. We at the &gt;&gt; head now. So, how many of you think you're in the latest church age? He says, "We are at the &gt;&gt; head now. This is &gt;&gt; Christ, not arms time back in Luther. This is what time? &gt;&gt; This is head time. &gt;&gt; Christ, the headstone comes to the body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is in 64. Amen. Hallelujah. He called out the elect. Now watch. Put up that other picture there. He called out the elect to make the Lutheran. He called out the elect out of the Lutheran to make the Wesleyan. So what he is telling you, the people that made up John Wesley's age were called out of Luther's age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They didn't come from nowhere. &gt;&gt; They were once under Wesley's uh Luther's justification message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But they followed the leading of the spirit and they were called out of here. Come out of her, my people. &gt;&gt; They became Wesians. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the people that came out of Pentecost didn't come from nowhere. &gt;&gt; They were called out of John Wesley's age. &gt;&gt; Called into this age. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; They were people that make &gt;&gt; the flesh. &gt;&gt; The top stone didn't just pop out of anywhere. They were called out of the Pentecostal age. &gt;&gt; Come out of all my people. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's continue reading that poll. He called out the elect to make the Lutheran. He called out the elect out of the Lutheran to make the Wesleyan. He called out the elect out of there to make the Pentecostal. Now he's calling the elect Pentecostals out to make the headstone to come into it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A Now again, watch. He's not just leaving you with a picture of a pyramid. He goes back to what it actually means. &gt;&gt; A very same kind of ministry dropping right in on it. calling his children from all denominations and all walks of life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The ministry must match. Then you know you're coming to needle point. Then you know you are in the headstone. &gt;&gt; So don't just be satisfied with doctrine and understanding teaching. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is your life matching Christ? &gt;&gt; If your doctrine and your teaching is not making you like Christ, something is wrong with your doctrine and your teaching. That's right. &gt;&gt; Which means if your teacher is not good enough for you, you need to get another teacher. &gt;&gt; You're failing maths, you need to get extra tuition. &gt;&gt; In the natural, we let's be honest now. Let's be real. In the natural, we are so concerned if we fail maths, fail physics, I want your private &gt;&gt; so particular about natural grades. We're failing miserably spiritually. And we thinking we're going to pass by with a double G. &gt;&gt; God's not going to take you, never mind, you failed, son. Come. &gt;&gt; No. You must overcome. &gt;&gt; You must perfect what you are perfected or called to be. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And you know what? It is in you to overcome. &gt;&gt; It is in you to come to perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. You just need to lay aside the things of this world, things that are holding you back and allow the spirit to take control. &gt;&gt; The very same kind of ministry dropping right in on it. Calling is shown from all denominations and all walks of life. Watch Brother Brandon doesn't stop there. Now watch, he's going to place somebody there. A ministry. Remember, the angel will only walk through people. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now he says what has he done? So he called you out of latest year. He says he called you and then he says what has he done? He placed them with true teachers. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; True prophets who stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible, my sheep hear his voice, said Jesus. If that was his voice, then it's his voice now. Anything contrary to that voice, it's not sheep food. they won't follow it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's just see here what we we're going to we're trying to draw to a close now. The messenger to the bride age, the flange. Amen. The messenger to the bride age, which is also called the flange and the top stone to meet the headstone. It says that same Jesus Christ is here. We're just going to lay these quotes to thoroughly identify what the prophet says that he is here. &gt;&gt; That same Jesus Christ is here. He is the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here is the message and he is the messenger toident here to identify his message. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Read it. He is the messenger here to identify his message. &gt;&gt; What is the message? You are coming into his likeness and image. &gt;&gt; He's here to identify you &gt;&gt; in my image. In my image. In my image. &gt;&gt; Join. Join. Fit. Fit. &gt;&gt; I am not the messenger. &gt;&gt; He is the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is the message. Now, if any of you disagree with it, how many of you disagree that William Brandom is not the messenger to the headstone? Well, let the prophet answer you. If you've got a spirit that disagrees with that, how can it be the messenger of the message? Only the token will identify it. &gt;&gt; Oh, so you mean you disagree with it? You don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes. Leave me in the latest year condition. I like every day the prophet to say come out of my people because me I love Netflix. I love showmanax. Me I love my movies. I love my worldly things. Leave me here because I still want the prophet every day to call me. &gt;&gt; And every now and again I feel uh I feel under conviction and I come out. Leave me in the lead spirit. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; leave me there. I like the prophet shouting &gt;&gt; talking to me about my dressing, talking to me about my shorts and my short dresses. &gt;&gt; People like that message. &gt;&gt; He's saying that's not the message &gt;&gt; for the people up here. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read that again. Let's go to 159 again because we are killing spirits now. &gt;&gt; That same Jesus Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the messenger. &gt;&gt; Here is the message. He is the messenger to identify his message. &gt;&gt; It's not William Brandham's message. &gt;&gt; It's his message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not the messenger. He is the messenger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is the message. And if you've got a spirit that disagrees with that, &gt;&gt; how can it be the messenger of the message? &gt;&gt; Only the token will identify it. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Now that word flange, let's put up that slide there where we get the description of the word flange. This is according to Webster. Now, a rip. Wow. &gt;&gt; I wonder who's the missing rib to meet the headstone. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You mean only at the end time he comes looking for his queen? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the root that was taken from his side at Calvary is put back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why is he calling us a flange? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; The prophet called us a flange. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says it's a flange at the top. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But now when we go and look at the meaning of land, it says a rip &gt;&gt; or form of strength for guiding or for an attachment to another object. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Father, &gt;&gt; now if we go back to the quote, he says, you get it. Those people who died in here are depending, waiting on us. So this church has got to come to perfection in order to bring the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And there souls under the altar waiting for the church to come to his perfection. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we read this. I'm just quoting it again to show you. It's a whole lot sharper than that, right? It's come to a needle point. Praise the Lord. So he's calling a pocket like I'm just going to that. So the next one is 175 F not I sent thee. He says now what is he doing that's got to be owned out so perfect that church brought into such a place that the stone that's coming to fit on top of it you say why are you repeating why you not believing &gt;&gt; now let's get to the word that we are actually called we are called flange &gt;&gt; we are called needle point &gt;&gt; we are called honed out people we are called holy ghost bunch &gt;&gt; is that all the words we've been speaking &gt;&gt; let's find another word the prophet uses to describe us and from now on we will know what our true name is &gt;&gt; in the pyramid &gt;&gt; listen he says you believe that this is the hour that Jesus is to come &gt;&gt; that the church has to come from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost just like the pyramid like the coming and now the top stone is going to have to be so perfect &gt;&gt; what stone &gt;&gt; Amen stone Yeah. &gt;&gt; You see, don't call yourself dogs. &gt;&gt; People like to say, "Hey, me, I'm a top dog." &gt;&gt; No, me. I'm a top stone. &gt;&gt; I'm a top stone. &gt;&gt; Read carefully like read slowly. And now the top stone is going to have to be so perfect. &gt;&gt; All the time he's saying we the church will have to be perfect. Church will have to be perfect. Now he's changing our name. The top stone will have to be so perfect. When the headstone comes, it has to blend right with it. &gt;&gt; Then he goes to describe it again. The ministry has to start out like this and just come into the minority all the time getting smaller groups. Smaller groups. You mean smaller groups? Why your church is so small? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know. He's saying smaller groups here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can't we get a bigger group? Maybe we can, but he's saying smaller groups. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until finally the stone meets with the building. He is the headstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Takes the whole building within which is the church. All of them will raise up plum back from the first watch onto the seventh and all go to the rapture. Each one had their day loed to them. They had the reformers founders so forth all down. And in this last days, it come into the eagle again &gt;&gt; which is back into the prophetic age to bring this together. &gt;&gt; Right. In in the statue of a perfect man, he says we are approaching the seals. We just finished the seven church ages and this message on teaching that ties a man that's going to be redeemed by the blood of the Lord Jesus that's going to be in the church age that eternal church age at the end of the seals. &gt;&gt; So this is also called the blending in. It's an eternal church age that time will blend with eternity &gt;&gt; up here. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; So did brother Brandham as a seven church age messenger like John the Baptist hear what he's saying declaring that he is here in the message the patriarch Abraham 1964 he says my ministry is different is a different ministry from a pastor or teacher but this is my ministry see to declare him &gt;&gt; that he is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Everyone say he is here. &gt;&gt; He is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we know what we're talking about when we are saying that he is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is brother Brandham's ministry to declare? &gt;&gt; He is here. &gt;&gt; So which means if brother Brandham is dead then he must have already declared that he is here. &gt;&gt; Right? Then he says, "Look what we've seen in this day. The quickening power has come to us." &gt;&gt; What is quickening power? Another name dynamics. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; The quickening power has come to us to open the seven seals. &gt;&gt; What was that? The intelligence of a man. No, the quickening power of God. The quickening power of God for who told us what would take place. Quickening power of God made the world testify to it. It's the truth. The angel of the Lord I told you was around in a pillar of fire quickening power. Let the world testify that it's the truth. &gt;&gt; And in that they didn't know what it was. We knew just look this way. It's our Lord up there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait. I'm tying something you very sharp. &gt;&gt; He just said my ministry to declare is here. &gt;&gt; And in this message, he's saying it's our Lord up there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. People don't like to read. Amen. &gt;&gt; They still want to go down here later. Talk about this. Talk about that. &gt;&gt; Did he say his ministry to declare he's here? &gt;&gt; What is he saying here? And nobody wants to read this. &gt;&gt; It's our Lord up there. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So which means he declared he is here. &gt;&gt; Yes. This is in now 1965. He's preparing to leave the earth. It's in the message. It is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know a lot of you probably theology is getting shaken now because you believe in brother Brandham opened the seven seals and did all of this. Let's keep reading. It's our Lord up there 308. He is the one &gt;&gt; who opened those seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see why? Because you are like that boy standing by Elisha. All you can see is physical things. &gt;&gt; He could see physical things. Syrian army. &gt;&gt; So Elisha said, "Lord, open the boy's eyes." &gt;&gt; Now if you were looking at William Brandham and you can only see William Brham, we are praying that the Lord open your eyes to see behind the veil. &gt;&gt; Amen. And even this morning, if you can see beyond the veil, you'll see who's standing here speaking to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because physical uh expectations will only see physical things, physical manifestations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the one who opened those seals. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is those seals. For the whole word of God is Christ and Christ is the seals that was opened. What is the opening of the seals then? Revealing Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the very seven angels which represented the seven church ages all complete. We couldn't even see it. They did. They took the picture &gt;&gt; and they look at it like this. They took the picture. &gt;&gt; So when they see it, all they see is this until &gt;&gt; he got decoded information &gt;&gt; from the world that it was sent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He got communication. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he let me know I was looking at the picture the wrong way. &gt;&gt; He beat FBI intelligence. &gt;&gt; He beat C I intelligence. He beat M16 intelligence. &gt;&gt; It beat South African intelligence. &gt;&gt; Here was not artificial intelligence &gt;&gt; but supreme intelligence. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; He said, "You know what, man? Turn down the picture &gt;&gt; to the right." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because science will tell you, "We don't want to temple with the picture. We want to see it the way it was taken." &gt;&gt; This is the original. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Even message people preach this. Keep it the original way. What? according to the world &gt;&gt; or you going to take what the law told the prophet &gt;&gt; turn it to the right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's our Lord up there. &gt;&gt; Right. They took the picture, not us. And there he is. And there is &gt;&gt; standing right beside his little bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is he saying? There he is standing there. Supreme church &gt;&gt; showing that he is alpha and omega, &gt;&gt; beginning and the end. And what identification? What did that to you? Quickening power did that to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know what? It's not only back there. He's still doing it now. &gt;&gt; Even now, quickening power is illuminating our minds. &gt;&gt; Even now, quickening power is making it more clear to us. Quickening power is making it more real to us. &gt;&gt; Quickening power, let us see his coming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Quickening power snatched us from death to life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are here to welcome back Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our ministry is to welcome back the headstone. He says the hearts of the last day children will be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers. &gt;&gt; John got the fathers ready for Jesus to welcome the children into the fold. Now this prophet upon whom the spirit of Elijah falls would prepare the children to welcome back Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As William Brandon prepared you to welcome back Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then how about we welcome him back. Say, "Lord, shake me, mold me, hold me up, oh God, so that I can welcome back Jesus." &gt;&gt; Let's get another quote in there quickly. But thank God, in the last days, there will be a group rise up. The true bride of the last day, she will listen to the spirit in the day of gross darkness. &gt;&gt; The light shalom will return &gt;&gt; by the pure word. And we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ. So I'm expecting the power that was there in Pentecost to be the power back in the church. &gt;&gt; God will put a power back in the church. They'll stop sickness. They'll stop disease. They'll stop cancer. Whatever they say will happen on the earth. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; why will it be them? No. It will be him in them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. last quote. Now in the seventh seal, he says, "And did you notice that one angel, the one that everyone is confused about, the one that they thinking it's William Brandham, they're saying William Brandom saw himself. That one angel I said in there was a strange angel. He looked more to me than any of the rest of them. You remember that &gt;&gt; they were in the constellation. Three on a side, one on the top. Now everyone, everyone good at math here? Three on a side. That's 3 + 3 &gt;&gt; and one on the top. How many is that? &gt;&gt; Seven. Okay. And the one right next to me, which means brother Brandham is also caught up in there. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; Was he caught up? And the one so listen to why I'm bringing that point. He's saying there seven. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; So the one on the top they are saying that was William Brandham. &gt;&gt; It's theophony &gt;&gt; but it's Christ. &gt;&gt; Because what he saying and the one right next to me &gt;&gt; counting from the left to the right would have been the seventh. So he is saying I am not that seventh angel. People are confusing the seventh angel of revelation 10 &gt;&gt; and counting the seven angels in the pyramid. &gt;&gt; They need to be taught properly. &gt;&gt; These seven angels that came are heavenly angels. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says they had wings, &gt;&gt; swept back wings, powerful wings, great wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Flying wings. &gt;&gt; And the one right next to me here, so it wasn't him, it was next to him. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Counting from the left to the right would have been the seventh angel. He was brighter. &gt;&gt; Meant more to me than the rest of them. You remember &gt;&gt; he had his chest out like that. &gt;&gt; Was flying eastward. &gt;&gt; He's flying eastward. You remember like that? It picked me up, &gt;&gt; lifted me up. You remember that? &gt;&gt; Here it is. The one with the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Didn't we just read there? He didn't open the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Here it is. The one with the seventh seal. Christ. &gt;&gt; The thing I've wanted all my life. Amen. Them other seals meant a lot to me. Of course, but oh, you don't know what this has meant for one time in life. &gt;&gt; So to summarize, we are not in the ladies church age. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The bride has been gathered here now &gt;&gt; like a flange, a rip &gt;&gt; to fit the headstone. &gt;&gt; There may be one or two, maybe even this morning, one or two are going to come up to the headstone. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We don't know when the rapture will take place. &gt;&gt; But I tell you, church, we don't have long. &gt;&gt; We don't have long. &gt;&gt; So, if you need to make your life right, make it right now. &gt;&gt; If you need to repent, repent now. If you need to get right with God, get right with God now. &gt;&gt; You heard what the prophet of God says there. He left a true five-fold. He left a true pastor. He left a true teacher. He left a true prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So that the angel of God can walk through. &gt;&gt; Amen. How about we give the Lord a good hand of praise? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. &gt;&gt; Oh, we bless his name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is the picture becoming more clear? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We understand our time and season &gt;&gt; now. Then he says, remember he says the musicians can come. If we understand our time and season, he says, then we can have the right kind of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So our ministry must match Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We must be so in his image and likeness. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. Forgive me. Sometimes I'm just a bit sharp in my words, the way I say things, but it's to bring a point. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because when you're handling swords, swords are not blunt. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you know a word is a sword. &gt;&gt; Words are meant to cut. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because horning takes a lot of cutting. &gt;&gt; To get that needle point takes a lot of cutting. Needs a brickmason. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, let's just worship him and give him praise. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Let's sing. Let your word be born in the manger of my heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Can we sing it? Amen. [Music]
