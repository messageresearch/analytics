========================================

greeting brothers and sisters the scripture I chose today is from Romans 3 from verse 21-31 but now the righteousness of God without the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets even the righteous of God which is by the faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon and all of them that believe it but there is no difference for all have sinned and come short of the glory of God being justified freely by his grace through Redemption that is in Jesus Christ whom God has set forth to be a prop through faith in his blood to declare that his righteousness is for the remission of sin that are passed for the forbearance of God to declare I say at this time is righteous that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it is excluded by what law of of Works n but by the law of Faith therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law he is the god of the Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also seeing it is one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith do we then make the void the LA through faith God forbid y we establish the law in the message it also says this is the key note to the scriptures Faith he that cometh to God must believe that he is and the reward of those who is D diligently seeking without faith is it

sister say God bless you amen hallelujah thanks amen praise the Lord amen everybody feeling good amen hallelujah he's worthy of praise worthy of honor amen let's turn to our Bibles amen we'll go to the book of Amen Genesis amen the Book of Genesis let's start reading from verse 37 amen let's read from verse three now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and when his Brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his Brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his Brethren and they hated him yet the more and he said unto them yeah I pray thee this dream which I have dreamed for behold we are binding sheep in the field and lo my sheep arose and also stood upright and behold your sheep stood round about and made obes to my sheep and his Brethren said to him shal thou indeed Reign Over Us or sh thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated him yet the more for his dreams and for his words and he dreamed yet another dream and told it his Brethren and said behold I have dreamed a dream more and behold the Sun and the Moon and the 11 stars made obedience to me and he told it to his father and to his Brethren and his father rebuked him and said to him what is this dream that thou has dreamed shall I and thy mother and thy Brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the Earth and his bre Brethren envied him but his father observed the same amen hallelujah now I want to drop to a few verses here get to 37 and 18 so note now there's no prophet in the land there's no word of the Lord that we are told that he's hearing an audible voice we don't hear about the angel of the Lord all he has is a dream so the dream is typing the word of God Amen praise the Lord 37:18 says when they saw him a far talking about the brothers now even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him so their intention was not to sell him to slavery they want to kill him right remember Joseph is typing Christ now how many times we read in the New Testament in the gospels they want to kill Jesus and they said one to another behold it dreamer cometh come now therefore and let us slay him and cast him into some pit and we will say some evil Beast that devoured him and we shall see what will become of his dreams 22 Ruben is the one that stops IT he says shed no blood but cast him into the pit that is in the wilderness amen lay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands and deliver him to his father again amen 24 says and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty there was no water in it amen you may be seated we'll continue reading so even when they threw in the pit there's no water in the pit amen 26 says Judah now tells the Brethren what prophet is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood come let us sell him to the ishmaelites and let us let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother and our flesh and his bre Brethren be content right with that so I'm just going to go through a few things amen still reading now Hallelujah in verse 39 chapter 39 so remember he sold to the midianites he's now a slave going to go read the story at first before we get into the sermon amen 39:1 says Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Piper an officer of pharaoh captain of the god so these midianites sell him to Piper brought him of the hands of the ishmaelites which were brought him down to the and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man so remember in captivity he's still in prosperity in our journey amen even though we haven't reached the finish yet God is prospering our way amen amen remember Joseph is typing Perfection and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made him all made all that he did to prosper in his hand so watch now the world will try to use you more because they know you anointed they know you are blessed they're watching that you are a blessed person what whatever task you give them what whatever task they give you amen you are able to carry out with Excellence so they note these things and they put you to work amen but remember we are called to walk in the kingdom and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had put into his hand and he let and he left all that was he had in Joseph's hand and he knew not what he had amen save the bread which he did eat and Joseph was a goodly person well favored amen we're not going to go into the rest you'll know there pipa's wife now makes an attempt Amen to seduce him but Joseph being an upright man refuses the advances and she lies against him and now amen they throw him into prison now as soon as he's thrown into prison in verse 21 there it says but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of The Keeper of the prisons and The Keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper amen hallelujah so we're seeing a patter in Joseph's life amen I want you to know Joseph was not a lazy man any position they put him in he rose to the first position because he was not a lazy person he took his duties he took his responsibilities seriously amen and he had the spirit of Excellency within him amen hallelujah in 41 you see here in Genesis 41:14 then Pharaoh said sent and called Joseph and they brought him eastly out of the dungeon and he shaved himself and changed his rment and and came in unto Pharaoh so for Joseph appearance is very important he doesn't say oh no they call me unexpectantly uh the king can just see me with my long beard he takes pride in himself amen Joseph know he's coming before the king he makes them wait he shaves himself he gets himself all ready because he's coming into the presence of the Pharaoh amen so position yourself amen know how to carry yourself out amen hallelujah amen so you know then they laid out the dream before him and there in 41:38 and Pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom the spirit of God is amen now even the highest office in the land is recognizing the gift in this man and Pharaoh said to Joseph for as much as God had showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as Thou Art Thou shalt be over my house according unto Thy word shall all my people be ruled amen only in the throne will I be greater than thou and Pharaoh said unto Joseph see I have sent thee over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand and put it upon Joseph's hand not another ring now I know of another people that gets a ring in this time amen amen hallelujah one who's coming into marriage gets a ring praise the Lord and we know the marriage takes place here on the earth amen and a ra him with Veges of fine linen and put a gold chain about his neck and he made him to ride in the second Chariot which he had and they cried before him bow the knee and he made him ruler over all the land of Egypt and Pharaoh said to Joseph I am pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of Egypt amen just want to get to one more portion of scripture Hal hallelujah amen let's get to amen 45 chapter 45 so Joseph has two meetings first he meets the brothers amen he meets the brother and then he has a condition they must bring back Benjamin now remember the hearts of the children are what's what I'm looking for amen they don't have a good relationship with the father because of what happened to Joseph amen remember the father loved Joseph they sold Joseph they lied to the father and said he's killed so the relationship is strain so the hearts of the children have been turned away from the father amen Hallelujah am so Joseph sends them in order for the hearts of the children amen the hearts of the fathers should be turned back to the children and you'll find there that's typing the amen John the Baptist ministry because the father now listens to the children and he sends Benjamin but there's coming a time now the time that we are living in that the heart of the father is going to be turned back the heart of the children is going to be turned back to the fathers amen hallelujah amen what's happening Grace is going to meet Perfection yes amen remember the prophet is saying under Jacob it's Grace yes hallelujah praise the Lord amen under Joseph is perfection so what we are finding is Grace is coming to Perfection at the evening time amen amen at ab's time Grace is going to find perfection what is that we are going to find it in the message of the hour that whatever seats started the church is going to be the fruit on the tree praise the Lord amen so the title of my message this morning is amen after 25 years Grace meets Perfection amen hallelujah amen so a by saying that God measures faithfulness by what you've done with the promise of the word amen God measures faithfulness but what we have done with promise amen we find here at the age young age of 17 years old Joseph's life he's turned upside down he he held the highest honor in his father's house he was given a code of Many Colors notice this Mark of Distinction in Joseph's life even in his father's house he held the highest honor in his father's heart Amen in his father's house he held the highest Place amen hallelujah and we watch now he's got a code of Many Colors and each stage of his journey he gets a new garment when he sold as a slave amen he gets his slaves Rob when he sold as a servant into part of his house he gets his servants robe when he's sold when he's put down in the prison he gets a prisoner's robe and then when he's raised up into that highest position of Amen second in charge of all of Egypt he's given a rulers Ro a royal robe amen so he has five garments to mark his journey praise the Lord amen so when he is here now at 17 years old he's facing rejection he's facing amen that my brothers don't love me he's facing depression facing anxiety he's facing amen uh all of these negative emotions he's facing separation from family thrown into an unknown World Hallelujah because this world was nothing amen that Jesus knew about yes amen the word was made flesh he came from an Heavenly realm he was thrown into a totally unknown world yes he had never known flesh before praise the Lord amen so at 17 years old you had to learn to trust in God how old are we can we trust in God now remember all he had was the dream he had no written word he had to rely on the dream he had to rely on what was revealed to him through the dream and God there's no record that God continually comes to him to reassure him and reaffirm him so which means in the time of his lowest moments he must have went through loneliness he's in captivity Amen in this period before he's reunited with his brother and his father 13 years passes by so in 13 years he must have experienced a lot of lws in his life yes he must have experienced a lot of Heart Take amen being thrown from one position to the next and just when he thinks he is now the ruler in P's house he's falsely accused and thrown into prison yes even when the butler is restored to his position it takes him two years to remember Joseph yes in all of this time what is his attitude yes Hallelujah in the time of waiting for the dream the word to come to pass what is Joseph's attitude he still has the spirit of Excellence hallelujah amen no matter what we are believing the Lord for what we are trusting him for in the waiting in that waiting period amen we have got to learn to trust in Jesus in the infallible word of God Amen because he will never fail amen hallelujah praise the Lord I want to remind you that the prophet says things happen in the cycle of 2,000 years amen you can find that cycle of 2,000 years amen first 2,000 years Noah built the ark second 2,000 years Christ come this is the end of the Gentiles another 2,000 years now at the End of the Age he's got to declare himself as he did then or he did wrong remember we've been through these ports now I'm just refreshing your memory showing you that something happen every 2,000 years then we read another quote amen that in we would see Jesus sorry in Shalom the prophet is saying after he trusted God seen the miracles of god 25 years he waited on a boy a promised son then God told him to go sacrifice the very thing he waited for I'm trying to show you in the lapse of 25 years what are we doing with the promise of God remember how God measures faithfulness what we do with the promise yes praise the Lord so I'm taking another 25 years because it took another 25 years for Joseph to be reunited with his father praise the Lord amen he had to wait remember the dream says that your brothers will bow before you then he came back and told his father that you will bow before me that part of the dream amen was only fulfilled after 25 years praise the Lord amen so they their promises locked up for the bride and they unfolding promises for us but no matter the ls and the eyes we Face amen we've got to remain faithful to what God's word says about us amen hallelujah praise the Lord so we know that Joseph now is waiting for this dream to come to pass amen 22 years going 23 years he meets and he's reconciled with his brothers amen but God has positioned Joseph and God has positioned us that in every season of our life he has a purpose for it so God has called us now through this dimensional door I'm going to go now straight into our message that God has called us into a dimensional door of the shout for a purpose Hallelujah denominations can't enter this door they can't understand what happens behind this door of the message of the hour they can't understand the mysteries of God they can't understand the Seven Seals they can't understand the seven Thunders amen they can't understand all that is being revealed to us in this age because that's a dimensional door that's been opened to the bride that only we can enter yes it's a revelation only for the bride Hallelujah I'm trying to Define our purpose now yes I'm trying to show you the vision for us and not take you away enough from Joseph and show you that there's a promise for us that we have to be married to the Lord Jesus Christ praise the Lord that's the goal the purpose we have to be married to the word we have to be married to the bridegroom what happened in Matthew 25 the door was open she was taken into the the marriage prophet of God says the marriage happens here on the earth we're not going to a marriage the marriage happens now now we are being united with the word amen God called us out of every denomination God called us out of every religion God has chosen each and every one of us we have responded to the message of the hour and that puts an eternal quality within you amen shows that you are predestinated seed of God shows that you have a gene quality within you the fact that you responded to the message of the hour and you can believe the promise for this age you can believe William gram is the prophet you can believe that you are now going to be the word made flesh he's showing that you are not bypassing the promises for the age and that is a sign that you have the Holy Ghost thank you Lord the prophet of God says that a definite sign is that you recognize your day and its message and not only recognize you go on to live it out praise the Lord so we are united now with the word in an invisible Union and the word is molding us and shaping us into his image and likeness can somebody say amen and as the Bride of Jesus Christ the word is washing us purifying us we stand Justified now amen We Stand Sanctified we are filled with the Holy Ghost until now we are the word made flesh oh I don't believe that there's coming a time when we are the word made flesh I believe now are we the Sons and Daughters of God I believe now is a season for the word made flesh I believe now is a Time amen when that word is becoming a alive within us and reproducing The Life of Christ within us amen stop doubting yourself stop second guessing yourself amen praise the Lord remember the word of God is always a prophetic word and it's an unfolding revelation of ourselves so amen no matter what we are going through in life don't doubt yourself don't doubt the word of God say I believe everything the word of God says I will be amen thank you amen now are we position for sunship now are we positioned where Sons will take back all that was lost we are here to rightfully reclaim all that was stolen from us in the Garden of Eden yes amen now Joseph wasn't always living on mountain tops 13 years he must have went through some valleys same with us we don't always live on mountain tops we're going through great trials we go through losses we go through depression we go through anxiety we go through trials of this life it's a and flow amen the prophet of God says that works like the seasons but I want you to be confident that in every season God is with us he said I will never leave you nor forsake you praise the Lord so like we were saying what is our attitude where we are currently in our lives we can develop an attitude that God has forgotten about me and become blinded by the surroundings and the situations Remember When Joseph is thrown into the pit he could have been sitting there at the bottom of that pit and all he's seeing is a besides of the walls yes what happened to the dream amen scoffers will come what happened super Church super race what happened Invincible arming amen Joseph had to encourage himself in the Lord he had to remind himself this is not what I saw the walls closing in around me is not what I saw when I look in the word this is not where I see myself amen I am the word made flesh today that's what the word says about me and that's how I must see myself Hallelujah the brothers could have stood on the STP of the pit and laughed at him yeah now who's bowing down Joseph who's bowing down now Joseph sounds a lot like those uh cousins that were scoffing at this girl that was given the promise that the bridegroom was coming for her she was there all dressed because Revelation 19:7 says that the Bride made herself ready she was waiting there with oil in her lamp I say it again the bride is not now the wise virgins standing outside in Leia with oil in their lamp if you seal the wise virgin with oil in your lamp out in Leia you haven't come into Matthew 25 where the bridegroom opened the door and pulled you into the marriage then you need to take marriage of the lamb and invisible Union and go and reread it and see that you have already been married amen you're not relying on any lamp light right now how many of you are relying on Starlight how many of you are relying on any light of the lamp when you get into the holiest of holies into the sh of glory amen there is no other light there besides your kind of Glory hallelujah amen so I'm saying amen that's what the message of the hour did the message of the hour came and brought the bridegroom here with the shout I'm going to say this way as well the Rapture is already in progress amen yes some people are still waiting for the Rapture you're going to miss if you miss your part of the Rapture you're going to miss everything hallelujah our part of the Rapture is being gathered together under the shout message because Jesus does all three things as he's descending he's now come with a shout the shout has gathered us together so we are already gathered in the Rapture caught up in Heavenly places the next part is the voice of the Resurrection which will be to the sleeping Saints Hallelujah if you are not caught up in the shout there's no way you're going to be caught up under the Trum yes Hallelujah because he says the Rapture is only for the bride and the bride is gathered where under the shout so if you haven't come under the message of William brandham if you haven't received the word of the age if you haven't come into Union with Jesus Christ and are married to him now there is no Rapture coming down the road for you hallelujah amen so what did Joseph have to do when he saw all adversity when he saw turmoil he had to focus sir because Satan tactics is to destabilize us yes Satan's tax is to take us our eyes off the word but every day I believe morning evening I don't know how many times a day Joseph prayed he had to refocus on the dream which is a type of the word he had to remind himself of the word one day even though I'm in this pit maybe when he was in part of his house he said even though I'm here as a slave maybe when he was a prisoner he said one day that dream of my brothers bowing down before me of my fathers bowing down before me will come to pass am Hallelujah I read a promise in the scripture to you that overcome Leia I will grant that you sit with me on my throne even as I overcame and I'm sat down on my father's Throne remind yourself of the scripture that one day amen one day amen you shall inherit because now you are overcoming the age amen hallelujah so he had to realign himself he had to refocus yes he was he was so confident that God had him in the seat Reon and that this purpose was orchestrated by God because God works all things together for our good amen so even when the Lord takes away when the Lord gives we say blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen it's the Lord who is in control of Our Lives amen all things are working together for my good amen we've got to encourage oursel and say my God is faithful yes amen hallelujah so if my God is faithful I've got to remain full of Faith amen my God didn't bring me this far to leave me my God didn't teach me to swim to Let Me Drown Hallelujah my God didn't take me into Heavenly places and TP me as a flying eagle amen for me to be tossed about by every wind amen because an eagle knows how to handle the storms of life the eagle actually uses the storms to start to Glide Hallelujah circumstances may look like it's against us amen it may seem like you right now you're in a holing pattern but my God's plans are greater than my current situation praise the Lord Jeremiah 29:11 says I know the thoughts I think towards you you mean God thinks of me God thinks of you individually God says have you seen my boy oh he's coming nicely into the word image Hallelujah have you seen my daughter coming nicely into the word image look how she submits herself to the word amen look in the midst of leosia in the midst of gross Darkness she's allowing he is allowing the word to be made flesh in her Hallelujah I know the thoughts I think toward you say the Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to give you an expected end amen God didn't give us the ability to have the spirit of the Flying Eagle for us to disintegrate In The Heat Of The Sun yes am because up there you closer to the Sun but God has given them the resistance to release resilience to cope with the heat of the sun that's why not anyone can get called into the shout door because there it's a sunlight only a certain class can handle sunlight hallelujah praise the Lord you better not come into there with sunscreen allow the full raise of the the Son of God hallelujah tell your neighbor no sunscreen don't screen out the Son of God praise the Lord with my Eagle abilities I can cope with the heat of the sun I can cope with the storms of life amen I know how to use my wings in the storm clouds I know how to use my winds in the change of to my advantage amen I've been equipped with the spirit of the Flying Eagle amen amen to get out of the chicken bar to get out of chicken denominational chicken yards amen I know that Satan is powerless before me I know I am because the message of the hour revealed my true identity I'm not confused I one with my purpose I am one with my goal I'm equipped with the word to face anything that life throws at me I can handle any situation I can face any trial I can win every battle I can conquer every enemy because greater I said greater amen greater is he that is within me than he that's in the world Amen we are equipped with the swords of the spirit because the weapons of our Warfare not carnal amen because although we live in the natural realm we do not wage a military campaign amen amen against human beings but against principalities and powers that with Spirits have Tred to manipulate and dislocate amen we are using spiritual weapons amen energized with divine power we have divine power in this hour am to effectively dismantle the defenses of the enemy with the word of your mouth demons are cast out amen dismantling strongholds dismantling amen Satan's schemes to destroy your life with the word of one prayer amen demon powers are leaving amen sicknesses are being healed amen you lay hands upon the sick and they recover what are you doing dismantling Satan's schemes that sickness Satan thought he would kill you with it but God is just mentally schems thank you thank you Lord what is it us conforming to the word us believing that the Lord says that I have the power to lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover us coming into that full position now under the third pool to realize that we carry the power of the spoken word in our mouth and I stand you like Adam stood there and he can speak to a mountain and he can move how I speak a word and I believe it shall come to pass and I don't doubt what I say that's Mark 11:23 praise the Lord amen amen we are demolishing every one of Satan's schemes amen with his deceptive fantasies yes Lord amen of the latest SC condition coming to tell you yes some woman last after her we say no we won't amen allow our eyes to last after flesh amen hallelujah praise the Lord that might be okay for some Demon to last after but a Son of God won't last after these things amen amen they throw money at us we say no that might be good for some denominal chicken but we are not moved by money amen money is meaningless to us because our King amen is God hallelujah hallu hallelujah we use from the father's treasury he there to the Royal Grant Hall we use from the father's treasury as we need yes right he says such as I have give I am to thee amen hallelujah amen we are here to punish and Destroy every one of Satan's demons amen Satan Can't Hold You captive any longer yes Lord in fact right now we bind that Spirit that's upon you that's holding you captive that's holding you bound even sicknesses that you don't know that are dwelling in your body we speak to demon powers even now and we bind that Spirit In The Name of Jesus Amen yes Lord Satan may be hiding in the form of a clo artery I speak clear blood flow in the name of Jesus thank you Lord maybe there's a cancer cell not yet discovered amen I speak even now that not even cancer will be able to stand in the way hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen every trace of rebellion every trace of addiction amen every Trace right now we make it bow in the name of Jesus we make it bow in the presence of Jesus Amen be Del it in the name of Jesus he the son has set free he's free indeed lay your hands upon you if you're sick now lay your hands on your neighbor they sick right now and claim it right now thank you Lord

blessed to be stressed I'm too anointed to be disappointed hallelujah hallelujah yes praise the Lord you can't steal my joy devil amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah when Satan Satan is the biggest how don't know lunatic he thinks that a child of God when he brings adversity sickness diseases Upon Our Lives that we go into some corner and cry we go that time to the word of God to find the promise in the word yes Lord that's what Sons and Daughters do we go back to the word of God to find a promise in the word of God because we know God God's promise will never fail amen yes L thank you thank you Lord praise the Lord so I'm saying God is coming after 25 years to confirm Joseph's dream like how he came 25 years to Sarah and Abraham yes he's coming to the one to whom he gave the promise oh I pray you get this this morning he is coming now did we reading Shalom message that God has promises for each new year amen the prophet of God clearly says that God has promises for each new year so after 25 years he's coming to Abraham and Sarah the ones that were given the promise after 25 years he is bringing Grace that's Jacob to Joseph yes which means he's turning the hearts of the children to the fathers praise the Lord amen it may have taken 25 years but at the 25th year it's when it was finished they had to completely turned hallelujah amen hallelujah what is God doing after 25 years he's reconfirming with Abraham and Sarah that the promise I gave you 25 years ago even though you've been on a journey of ups and downs in your own life life even though right now there stands a boy born out of the promise of God ishma and you are raising him up as your son even though you are content with that form of life you are settled into a routine and a pattern I have come to disturb your pattern after 25 years that which I promised you 25 years ago this is the year I will bring it to pass say the Lord am am so he comes to Abraham Sarah and say what are you doing you are raising up ishma that's not the whom I told you I that this promised son would come through you'll have S into the form of Lifestyle you'll have set into the form in Tradition you'll have taken this boy and you'll are raising him up as one of your own amen but he is not one of your own did I not tell you that Isaac amen did I not tell you Abraham that you shall have a son through Sarah yes after 25 years he's coming to reconfirm which Bing ground he's going to come through after 25 years he's yet to remind you he's not coming through a denominational oh womb amen he coming through your home amen praise the Lord amen amen the prophet of God in one message says that God changed Abraham back to 45 years old amen God can reverse things in your life right hey do you believe God is the same yesterday today and forever come on now all the years the Locust Caterpillar p Canam is eaten God can restore to you I need somebody to believe that even now if Satan has robbed you of joy in your life robbed you of your family life God can restore it to you thank you Jesus thank you Lord I believe he's the same yesterday today and for ever if he could turn Abraham back to 45 amen here they are sitting there in Matthew in Genesis 18 Abraham is 100 or 99 Sarah is 99 is it that 75 amen old past the age of childbearing besides Sarah being past the age of childbearing she had cried for All That 70 years yes she was Barren yes she couldn't have a child praise the Lord so 25 years had gone adjusted their lives content with the way things are content with the way things are in the message I go to church I listen to a good message God is saying not this year God is saying not this time around I am coming now to confirm my promise shall I hie from Abraham that which I'm about to do read second Peter because God is Not slack concerning his promise 2 Peter 3:9 the Bible says the Lord is not slack concerning his promise you have promised a body change but before the body change you are promised to come into Union with Christ that is a promise praise the Lord the Lord is not SL concerning his promise as some men count slackness but his longsuffering to usw not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance amen amen thank you Lord now to tie a parallel with this we may have forgotten about God's promises in our lives maybe God has confirmed something to you individually God has spoken something to you maybe we forgot about his maybe we forgot about his purpose but I want you to know God has not forgotten about it God has not forgotten about what he has spoken to you when God speaks a thing it must come to pass amen amen numbers 23: 19 I want you to believe in the Lord numbers 23:19 says God is not a man that he should lie amen praise the Lord in Isaiah 55 Isaiah 55 verse 10 for as the rain cometh down and the snow from heaven and R return it not tother but water the Earth and maketh it bring forth and but that it might give seed to the sewer and bread to the eater so the Lord is typing this this uh scenario of sewing and reaping and with the natural elements of rain and all of these things and you're receiving an AR so watch how he types it now he says so my word be that goe forth out of my mouth so he's saying my word is like that it's like a seed that goes forth amen it shall not return unto me void yes Hallelujah yes meaning if God sent you out with a mango seed you are not coming back with a mango seed but you're coming with a harvest of mangoes amen meaning that when the Lord told met the prophet in the cave in 1946 I'm going to send you out to the nations of the world I'm going to equip you with two signs and then he further gave him a third pool telling him he would get the Bride of Jesus Christ he's not coming back empty-handed but now at our's time there is coming forth a bride Hallelujah we can't keep reading that and saying there will be a bride there will be a bride no it's gone way past 25 years amen 25 years have come and gone now we are presenting to the Lord amen the Lord will present to himself a glorious Church Without spot without wrinkle I'm saying now is the time now is the season let us rise to our full potential am amen we were called for this purpose let's not forget the vision let's not forget the dream this is what we are called for for the marriage of the Lamb amen we are called Amen to the marriage of the lamb and then he has to take his bride away to the married supper he has to give us a change of bodies that's a promise that's coming to pass yes amen hallelujah and I tell you if you've got the first part already and you are already sealed under the shout that body change is a guarantee the Rapture is only for the bride and the bride is called under the shout thank you Lord I want to reaffirm with you you can't believe this message by chance yeah right no way there's no way you can endure this kind of preaching the kind of hardness of preaching that the prophet amen preached that's right amen sisters that allow the word to mold them and shake them when it's not popular in the world but they allow the full effect of the word no if my Lord says I mustn't cut my hair I won't cut my hair if the Lord says I won't wear makeup and jewelry and all of these kinds and expose my body amen you are conforming yourself to to the word amen if the Lord told the men don't wear shorts amen don't have long hair don't drink don't smoke take care of your family be responsible you are allowing yourself to be influenced by the effects of the word you Lord praise the lordu so God is with me in every season of my journey go and read the book amen and the story of Joseph God is within every stage of the journey what the enemy meants for evil God will turn for good the enemy may have tried to destroy your life his brothers tried to destroy his dream say up to me Satan Satan can't destroy can't destroy my dream my dream amen hallelujah thank you if where you are right now is not what God showed you if you find in yourself in the pit if you find yourself in a circumstance keep encouraging yourself this is not what God showed me am amen than when you find yourself a prisoner say this is not what God showed me amen when you find yourself a slave say this is not what God showed me amen hallelujah what we have got to do keep The Word Alive Joseph had to keep the dream alive we have got to keep the word aliveall you know that by allowing the message to denominate by Creeds and dogmas and you making a tradition we can make the word die but we have got to keep The Word Alive am amen praise the Lord amen Joseph was destined to win and so are you amen Joseph was destined Amen to get to the top part of the Kingdom amen so don't give up on yourself now like I said through that 13-year period Joseph must have had many laws don't give up on yourself now praise the Lord don't give up on the word of God don't look to our own abilities as well there's nothing we can do to save ourselves God has already done it God has already predestinated Us Praise the Lord amen and I want you to know that your life is packed with promise amen your life is packed with promise if Joseph typed Christ and Joseph was a man of perfection and everything that he touched was prosperous hear me now everything Joseph touched was prosperous God is bringing his bride in His image and his likeness which means everything the bride does t speaks is prosperous word can only marry word praise the Lord Romans 8:28 we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God to that to them who are called according to his purpose thank you Lord for the children being not yet born neither having done good or evil that the promise of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that cth for the scriptures said unto Pharaoh so now he's showing you the purpose of pharaoh for even for the same purpose have I raiseed Thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth 1 John 38 show you the purpose of the Son of God he says for this purpose the Son of God was manifest that he might destroy the works of the devil I'm going to use the same application there if the bridegroom was sent to destroy the works of the enemy The Bride In His Image and likeness is here to destroy the works of the enemy amen Christ in bright form destroys the works of the enemy amen so I'm closing Now by telling you that you have been positioned for this stage of the journey you have been called for this stage of the journey amen hallelujah and our end result is one of power and authority yes remember power and authority and the prophet is teaching us at Power without character is satanic so whatever we're going through in our life amen God is building up our character am but Power with character is for to rule so in every season God is molding and God is shaping thank you Lord through every circumstance God is molding God is shaping am amen why is he doing that to handle the next season God is doing this to handle the next season praise the lord we have been positioned strategically right now and the dream is moving forward I'm using that word dream to show you Joseph's type but I'm saying the word is moving forward the vision is in progress and we are on our way to the biggest Victory yet when death will be swallowed up in Victory when we shall have a changing of these bodies do you have a promise of that in your life amen do you know the rapt tree is already in your jean seed Hallelujah and what's in the jeene seed must come out if God pack the jeene seed within you positioned for Rapture you must take a Rapture yes you can't go in the tribulation you can't go by the way of death thank you hallelujah thank you Lord amen oh praise the Lord hallelujah amen amen we have have much more to go but I want to leave it there maybe amen hallelujah let's read 45:23 in closing Genesis 45:23 I want to show you something that it was the evening time it was when Joseph was already in position it was in the year of lack the year of Plenty had passed seven years of plenty had passed it was now in the year of lack in the 25th year is it the year of lack will there be famine in the land yes did the Bible predict there'll be famine in the land and to his father he sends after this manner 10 asses Laden with good things of Egypt and 10 Shas is Laden with corn bread meat for his father by the way who is sending this Perfection a bride who comes to Perfection how many how many 10 and 10 has to do with eating has it has it to do with eating go to Revelation 10:10 there's a bride who comes to perfection in Revelation 10 and 10:10 says says she takes the book eats the book sweet in the mouth and as soon as I had eaten my belly was bitter and what happens in verse 11 she must now give out again she must send back so I'm trying to show you that Jo that Jacob Grace meeting Joseph Perfection is happening now amen we are being united with the word we can't say we under the shout because Jesus does all three three things as he descending come on now so it's Jesus in the shout does Jesus does all three things as his descending so we are caught up in the shout and message going forth together the living Saints who are we meeting in this dimensional door of the shout amen amen sir are we caught up in the cycle of the Rapture yes amen praise the Lord amen so that I'm just showing you Revelation 10:10 there the bride who comes to Perfection is Thoroughly equipped to nourish the Earth that's why you ask to prophesy again nourish the Earth call the names in the book praise the Lord amen 46:5 and Jacob rose up from BBA and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him I wish you could see the same man the seed that started the church is going to now meet the fruit brother Bram says whatever seed start at the church that's what will come out at the hour time amen how many of you know a a son is a continuation of the father a son is the father reproduced so who is Joseph who is Jacob really meeting he's going to meet himself in Perfection Jacob was the seed but he's going towards Perfection and they took the cattle the goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan and came to Egypt Jacob and all his seed within and his sons and his son Sons with him his daughters amen and then he goes on to name them amen praise the Lord I'm going to skip through all of that verse 28 and he sent Judah before him unto Joseph why the lion of the tribe of Judah he's coming as son of son of David before him unto Joseph to direct his face unto Goan and Joseph made ready his Chariot and went up to meet Israel his father to Goan and present himself unto him and he fell on his neck and wept on his neck for a good while and he shall turn the heart of the children to the fathers after how many years is it completed the cycle after 25 years he's now reunited with his father praise the Lord amen if you can find this quote I just want to read it so you can maybe get it we close with this whatever seed started the church because that's a beautiful picture now of what you are seeing he says whatever seed started the church will come forth and be like the Original Seed because it is the same seed in these last days the true bright Christ true true bright Church Christ seed will come to The Headstone and she will be the Super Church super race as she nears him now if we use that principle what the prophet is saying there had to be a super seed to Ser the church in order for not to come as a super church and a super race they and the bride will be so much like him that they will be in his very image amen this is in order to be United with him they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God the first son Adam was a spoken word seed son was a spoken seed word of God he was given a bride to reproduce himself why are we given wives to reproduce ourself for a son is the life of the father reproduced that is why the bride was given to him to reproduce himself to produce another Son of God Amen praise the Lord he goes on to say Jesus was also a spoken a seed word of God given a bride like Adam but before he could marry her she would Fallen amen she was put to the test if she would believe the word and live she doubted the word and died now he goes on to our last part this is packed with promise from a little group of the true seed of the word God will present Christ with a beloved bride amen she is Virgin of his word she's virgin because she knows no man-made Creeds or dogmas by and through the members of the Bride will be fulfilled all that was promised of God to be made manifest in the Virgin amen how does God measure faithfulness with what we do with the promise I'm saying after 25 years he is coming now to fulfill all that was promised through the prophet amen so expect to see yourself come to Perfection expect to see yourself become the word made flesh expect to see yourself do the Greater Works expect to see yourself return with power and authority expect to see yourself as a Son of God who's got to expect it Hallelujah we've got to expect it after 25 years Grace needs Perfection amen amen we've got enough quotes but I'm aware of the weather Amen to show you that Jacob was Grace and Joseph was Perfection so when these two come together it's Grace connecting with perfection am praise the Lord let's stand together and give him praise amen is it a pattern I'm asking you in the word of God is it a pattern yes is it a coincidence that Abraham and Sarah had to away 25 years is it a coincidence that Joseph had to away 25 years is it a coincidence that we find ourselves now 25 years later every 2,000 years something major happens is it a coincidence that we find ourselves strategically placed right now 25 years later is it the time and season when the promis word will come to pass all that was spoken of this bride will start to manifest all that you've been waiting for remember you are packed with promise hallelujah thank you I want to remind you you are like Joseph thank you and everything you put your hand to is Pros not will be is prosperous I want to remind you that you are called into the kingdom I want to remind you that you are asked to seek the kingdom first so first be prosperous in the Kingdom first excel in the kingdom and Jesus said all of these things in the natural will be added unto you thank you Jesus let's sing and worship Him amen hallelujah Glory Glory Glory let's him bow your knee Jesus is coming amen when the trumpet sounded
