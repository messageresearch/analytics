in me amen hallelujah a greater glory amen in that day you shall know as I'm in the Father the father in me it's I in you a greater glory call to a greater glory amen John chapter 5 amen praise the Lord Book of John chapter 5 so the verse starts out saying after this so after this means after chapter 4 after he goes to the woman at the well and there's a great amen the city of Samaria is saved they come to see the Lord Jesus Christ and he shows them many signs and wonders amen and he says after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to to Jerusalem amen and there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue betesda having five porches in these lay a great multitude of important folk of blind alt withered waiting for the moving of the water for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and Trouble the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 38 years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said unto him will thou be made whole the important man answered sir I have no man when the water is trouble to put me into the pool but while I'm coming another step down before me Jesus said unto him rise take up thy bed and walk amen amen yes Hallelujah and one week later the men was made whole and immediately amen the man was made whole yes and took up his bed and walked and on the same day was the Sabbath amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen praise the Lord amen what a glorious time to be living in amen how many of you are excited to be a part of the move of God amen amen hallelujah we are part of the move of God and God God will do nothing on the earth without doing it through the bride amen amen God will do nothing on the earth at this time now except you do it through the body of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so like we've been dwelling on I appreciate the inspiration on the brothers and now they were for those of you that may be thinking I I instruct these brothers to preach certain things or stay in thoughts and lines I don't do that amen they LED of the spirit of God and they tap into the anointing of God Amen Hallelujah so we appreciate the ministry amen and that they're able to tap into the anointing and catch also the revelation of what God is doing in this hour amen amen praise the Lord so like we were dwelling there on John 17 and we said we need to to come to a point where we say glorify me with the glory that I had with you in the beginning the foundation of the world Amen Hallelujah the highest form of God's glory is now being revealed through the Bride of Jesus Christ right what all that he want to achieve is now being expressed through us now just to dwell on this topic of or this example of this man he's here by a sheep Market the pool amen and it's called B they're having five porches amen amen and in those five porches there lays a great multitude of important folk blind folk all withed waiting for the moving of the water like the Bible says but there's an angel of God that comes and sweeps through the place at a certain season amen now this man would come there year after year for 38 years he was kept coming yes amen I can imagine the excitement the first time he came the enthusiasm with which he came to the water the excitement when he heard if you go to that pool you can be made whole you can be cleansed you can be delivered amen and how excited he must have been his friends must have carried him to the pool and laid him down there but nobody knew the time that the angel of God would come down amen yes and the first one that saw the angel stir up the waters and stepped in first was the one that got healed amen so 38 people have been healed before him yet he was not discouraged amen this man was strong in faith amen after year one they took him back home am and he lay with his infirmity probably had to deal with the symptoms the sicknesses the disease probably had to go to doctors probably had to go through the cycle of dealing with the sickness but year two came and he went back with the same enthusiasm amen this man was not discouraged amen and for somebody to come back after 38 years showed you that this man had faith in God that this man was a believer yes amen he wasn't discouraged he didn't say oh I've been going there year after year and I've not experienced the move of God he didn't say that that place is so full of important folk that there's no need for me to go there I I I've been there enough I've tried my luck and and there's no hope for me amen what was he persistent amen yes my title this evening you may have missed the the angel but down comes his glory amen you know where I'm going with this you may have missed the angel in 23 but now comes the glory of God Amen when his glory comes down when he the person of himself comes down amen amen when I'm talking about his glory coming down he's not coming down as a ghost to move through the people where is he coming through who is he coming amen amen so this man was not discouraged year after year he came back amen what about your situation what about what you are trusting the Lord for can you hold on by faith can you believe the Lord Lord amen don't be moved by by circumstance friends amen brothers and sisters don't be moved by circumstance don't be moved by people's opinions and some people have a negative opinion and a bad opinion they want you to live with your sickness they want you to live with your disease and say why don't you just accept it as your portion in life thank you Lord oh thank you Lord God has reserved you for special glory amen yes amen oh thank you Lord let me explain what I'm saying this man was not to be healed by the moving of the angel in the water this man was appointed from before the foundation of the world Hallelujah God was going to reveal his attributes on the earth that's why for 38 years God kept him from stepping into the water amen God reserved him for a special time when he would meet the Messiah himself amen oh yes amen greater than the Angel stirring the water this man would come into the kind of Glory of God stand before the almighty God in flesh Hallelujah yes Lord you've been called for a greater glory amen God has kept you back for this time in this season amen hallelujah Shake Yourself amen amen God has kept you amen it is not you keeping yourself it's him keeping you by the grace of God thank you Lord amen his love for you he's kept you this amen praise the Lord amen amen the Lord has kept you preserved you amen before the foundation of the world he had it in this man in his mind this man can't be healed by the angel moving the water when I myself step down in a body of Flesh amen after I meet the woman at the well I'm coming for this man am Hallelujah am and when does Jesus come down yeah on the seventh day the Sabbath you see this man was moving in this he was he was ending the sixth cycle of his life you know brother Bram talks about every seven years is a cycle he had gone through six cycles of his life he was going to end and enter that sixth cycle end that sixth cycle and enter the seventh cycle but he wasn't going to enter the seventh cycle as an important man hallelujah amen your next season the next move of God you where the glory of God is going to be revealed through you you are not going to be a defeated bride amen amen come on Church you know where you need to build your faith here in your mind that's where the Battleground is fought you need to know that you are more than a conqueror you cannot be defeated amen come on we need Fearless Warriors amen amen the battle is hot and heavy and Satan is on the Move seeking whom he may devour but God is raising up a standard and by God's grace you and I are part of that standard amen I am the standard that God has called in deran South Africa I am the standard that God is raising up in Phoenix amen yes Lord hallelujah think what you what you want of me I know who I am through Jesus Christ I know what he called me for therefore I can March into battle with the author of God and not be concerned about other people but I'm moved and led by the angel of God I'm moving by the holy spirit amen yesen now's not the time to worry about man's opinion about you man will never have a good opinion about you you go read the rest of that story they were telling Jesus you're not supposed to heal on the seventh day amen like many people don't believe there should be healings after the prophet yes we've had the final sign amen brother the final sign was the back turn to us but here comes the glory of the Lord here comes the glory of the Lord from a many membered body marching Onward Christian Soldiers Amen brother Brandon was a type of the Bride right why wasn't he marching in the line with the bride where was he watching from amen yes the vision sounds like he was watching from a dimension come on he should have been leading them as the messenger of the age but he said I saw this bride marching Hallelujah he didn't say he was there in the midst of them he said I saw marching and she was marching like that first church amen Christ in the church is a continuation of the book of Acts and this was marching marching marching but he says one of two of them started to get out of line and I screamed stay in line amen amen and then that's not the last thing he saw he said he saw this bride go [Music] up amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name amen so I'm encouraging you don't be discouraged by your situation yes your trial yes what your going through somebody was trying to convince us that the state of the youth is a terrible State trying to convince us that the Messi church has failed the youth and I couldn't identify with him that's right amen you see what the problem is parent delinquency now you blame the youth but I could not identify with him that's right amen he he says nobody out of my generation beside him now he's glorifying himself came out but I can't identify that the brothers and sisters that I grew up with are still standing strong in the message of the hour people want to use psychology with the youth you know what happened in the early days yeah that that brought this music into the church Kirk Franklin and all of this music the people didn't want to lead them to an experience of the Holy Ghost they themselves didn't have the Holy Ghost I'm talking about denominational churches they didn't have the Holy Ghost because they let the Holy Ghost and they had gone after material things so what they said is exact words now I had conversations with pastors used to come byy music from CLE sound systems from clean CLE music we need to buy the sound we need to buy the lights because we are losing our young people to the world we are losing our young people to the world so we need to bring this in to the church and play some upbit music and get some dance teams and let them do this let the young girls come forward and start dancing while the men look at them eye candy let the woman come up let them lead worship with their short skirts and the pastor is enjoying the show and God was not exalted but they were exalting flesh then they got the best of singers and the focus got taken away from the worship and the saw words going up to the Lord and they were impressed with the voices and they got the most skilled musicians and they were impressed with the musician and the skillfulness and the attention and the glory got taken away from the Lord my point is this I'm still driving the point people that are supposed to be men of God can't lead others to the Holy [Music] Ghost so they rather Lead You Down path of psychology they rather Lead You Down Pathways like that and tell you that the youth are finished and we need to have some psychological teaching and says they don't need to sit in the service and you're preaching I tell you brother you need to sit in the church and you need to come under the anointing of the Holy Ghost until the Holy Ghost convicts you amen amen yes I say I couldn't identify with it because right in the church we got young men yes amen that grew up in the church amen young men yeah how old three 3 years old 3 years old you all babies you've been to nightclub Smoke Drink been nightclub stand up as trophies of God come come come stand up stand up stand up stand up amen stand up stand up and be counted as trophies of God this is what the power of the Gospel can do yes you may be seated I would rather lead you to an experience with the Holy Ghost AM then to try and Pat you let's play a game piggy C be my friend what do you want remember any instruction coming from me as the pastor is out of love out of concern yeah amen amen the only thing the shepherd is concerned about is leading you to Christ amen amen trophies of the Gospel of Jesus Christ let me tell you young brothers and sisters sorry I don't make the sisters stand but yeah we have lots of sisters here amen if I go from the back amen there Sister Christina grew up in the church I don't know how old she was when she came in but she must have been really small there's jamaa there's Sister Sarah amen sister Josephine what are these didn't go into the world stayed under the anointing stay under the covering amen even now if you've never had an experience with the Lord stay under the anointing stay under the covering until you have an experience amen amen so that's why I say I couldn't identify with him because we've come through a different experience amen we've come through different leaderships amen amen so you can't paint the whole picture with one brush hallelujah amen and let me tell you this brothers and sisters that's the grace of God upon us yes because we could have been let down Parts but the grace of God has kept us why God won't keep you in that way except it before do not drink do not smoke do not defile your body in any way for when you are now grown up I have a for you to do he needs clean temples that he can manifest himself through amen praise the Lord amen hallelujah so you find amen if I'm going to type it this way I'll type it that way they had five porches and within these five porches lay a bunch of important people there supposed to be five pores in the church yes the protection of the church yes amen and we've let the sick lay too long we let the blind lay too long we've let the important lay too long why waiting for the moving of the [Music] waters but I tell you now we don't have to wait any longer because he himself has come down Hallelujah now it seems like a question that should irritate any sick person you're sick you've been laying there in that condition for 38 years and somebody asked you you want to be well what what's the matter with you why you asking me if I want to be well of course I want to be well unless some people like sickness you know some people love sickness they wait for the SL they go pretty party now tell the wife you know I'm feeling very sick they start ordering now what they want they lay in the bed they say you know 5 days the doctor said I must take the course 5 days don't trouble me they so faithful to the doctor's prescription but the prescription of the word like if I told you for 5 days proclaim the scripture by the stripes of Jesus I am here amen three times a day take it apply the prescription ah bro I'm feel so sick I can't even open my mouth but the doctor y you'll wake up from the bed you'll phone your wife you'll tell everyone bring the tablets three times a day night and the doctor said I must eat before I take this tablets we can be so diligent following the instruction of a doctor and yet we don't know what's in that pill like the prophet says now you got to have faith to take the pill because you don't know what's in the pill the doctor is telling you take this pill and you feel better nine times out of 10 as soon as you take the pill you feel better mental amen you feel now because you follow the instruction now if we can be so diligent about the natural body like that how about the spiritual body when instruction is coming forth I'm telling you if you can follow the instruction you shall see the glory of God in a greater way and you shall share in his glory hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen the Bible says immediately when Jesus told him take up your bed and walk immediately the man was made whole and he took up his bed and walked and the same day was the the Sabbath amen I tell you in the Sabbath in the seventh amen hallelujah it's time for the SI to be healed it's time for the blind to see it's time for the glory of God to be revealed amen amen there is a defate quote I know we've read it here we've let the sick lay too long waiting for a vision Lord we've let the blind lay too long waiting for a vision but the bride has the mind of Christ and she knows what he wants done with the word amen and we have a confidence to know that we are backed up we are backed up by Mark 16 we are backed up by Isaiah 53 we are backed up by one Peter amen 2:24 amen by the stripes of Jesus I am healed amen who in his own body bear our sins on the cross and by whose Stripes I am healed amen amen once you see the glory of God and once you yourself start to experience it watch the religious world now come and attack you cuz here in in in verse 10 it says the Jews said unto him that was cured the person cured now 30 years to watch him lie there you think they' Rejoice with him they come to him and says it is the Sabbath day it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed you know what they're telling him it's not lawful for you to be healed you know what they tell us watch now I'm showing you the same Spirit brother we move past that now yes we gone into the opening of the word you know what voice that is right you're all skilled here we don't need those things Same Spirit right yeah why are you healing on the seventh day you know we living at the seventh Church age ending of it Same Spirit why are you healing on the [Music] Sabbath he answered them he answered them he that made me whole the same said unto me take up thy bed and walk amen they then they asked him what man is that which said unto thee take up thy bed and walk and he that was healed was not who it was for Jesus had conveyed himself away a multitude being in that place afterward Jesus finded him in the temple and said unto him behold Thou Art made whole now yes key Jesus is giving him now where did Jesus Jesus find him in the temple what was this man doing in the temple he was giving an offering of thanks very important when we receive of the Lord we've got to come back with Thanksgiving yes amen we've got to come back with an offering of Thanksgiving amen amen and I want to shake amen the nervousness out of you I want to shake amen the starchiness out of you I want to shake the shinness out of you and tell you that even you young people need to start testifying for the glory of God amen amen some people imagine that if they come in the front and start to testify that the whole church is just going to laugh with them and think how spiritual they are we will be most happy to hear and we'll be amening and we'll be encouraging you yes brother amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so don't ever be shy to testify about God Amen here now it says afterward Jesus find him in the temple behold Thou Art made whole sin no more lest a worst thing come unto thee Jesus giving instruction now Jesus is teaching him how to keep his Temple clean otherwise Jesus knows seven worst demons are coming amen so Jesus meets him privately in the temple and he gives him instruction what's the instruction who shall Ascend the hill of the Lord he that had Clean Hands and a pure heart amen Jesus is telling him this thing Came Upon you because of Sin Sin no more lest a worse thing come upon thee unto thee amen I'm dwelling on this for a reason amen because I want you to be skilled in demonology I want you to be skilled in knowing that when you are healed from your sickness don't think that a worst thing can come upon you because you know people's memory are not like itself they forget the goodness of God they forget to count your blessings name them one by one count your blessings see what God has done amen amen a worst thing come upon thee people come into the house of the Lord they be delivered they set free from demon Spirits demon oppression demon powers they go home maybe the first day they okay second day they start to get tempted again and they fall back into that same old rut you mean to do well you mean to serve the Lord but something keeps pulling you down amen amen something keeps pulling you down why you are not feeding on the things of God you are not building yourself up strong yes you are you are basically living from experience to experience living from one church service to the next church service not building upon your Most Holy Faith that is why you are being pulled down and dragged down let me tell you demon powers are here to pull you down this is the age where the fourth Rider has gone forth and H is loose upon the Earth and demon powers are not just operating in the realm of the Lost he's got them so who you think they coming who's the attack coming against amen the attack is coming against the one that's going to end their kingdom yes they know that when we come to our position Satan is powerless am demon powers are powerless you see you you may be thinking what what use is all of this Revelation that I know in the message what is the benefit of knowing all the Revelation that God has revealed to me in the message of the hour Jesus said the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against Revelation you say but I'm learning about baptism I'm learning about the godhead I'm learning about the seven Church ages and The Messengers and how God worked through seven Church ages I'm learning about the seals I'm learning about the horse riders I'm learning about amen the seven trumpets I'm learning about the seven vials I'm learning amen about all of these things but Revelation like the prophet says when the bride gets a revelation of who she is what she is that she can do the Greater Works Yes she'll be an invincible Army and if she can recognize the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and withand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen amen so let me say it in a pler way your Revelation makes Satan powerless amen your Revelation makes Satan powerless when you stand there as a Son of God you speak and things start to operate things start to obey your voice when you start to recognize that you are a son and daughter of God Amen let me tell you every single Miracle every single thing that happened to you was because when you stood in your Authority and you recognize your position as a Son of God Amen as a daughter of God and you begin to open up your mouth and speak amen amen now when to move it from the realm of of just that one angle and tell you that you can apply it in all areas of your life because you are God on the earth amen you are a God on the earth you're wondering out you got an idea about point a but you need to end up at point B but right now there's no way for for you to come from point A to point B because there's so many obstacles along the way and it seems impossible for you to get from point A to point B who can I call who can I turn to who can I rely on yes I tell you rely on who God made you to be in this hour recognize yourself as a son and daughter of God recognize who you are and call Heaven and Earth to attention and say I am a Son of God I'm a daughter of God called and raised up for this hour greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world and I now stand and I take authority over the situation and I speak against every obstacle in the name of Jesus Christ amen and I ask that obstacle to move and every other obstacle that's holding up this obstacle to be removed in the name of Jesus Christen the problem is sometimes you're so we down Shackled by a heavy burden need the Lord of guilt and shame raise up Samson amen here comes the glory of the Lord what was happening when Samson's hair was growing here comes the glory of the Lord amen you may have been knocked down in battle but it's time to rise up what happened Samson recognized who he was amen who was the seven judge Hallelujah Samson major judges at the seventh they comes back the glory of God Amen comes back the glory amen greater more powerful yes super Church yes super race amen amen hallelujah you are not just daughter of somebody daughter of naid daughter of of Chetty daughter of Nicholson daughter of whoever you think you are you're a son and daughter of the most high you see the the most some people exalt themselves by saying I am the son of suban they're so proud they tell everyone you know who my father is so proud of Earthly father but when we begin to recognize ourselves as Sons and Daughters of the most high God I'm the son of a king they ask you who do you think you are Brandon we know Paul we know who are you what are you going to say what will you say amen can you come like Jesus before your fellow Brethren and say who do men say that I the Bride of the Lord Jesus is who do men say that I am ah some say you're a cult some say you follow a man some say you're Oneness some say you are Jesus only but I ask you who spiritual Discerning who do you say that I [Music] am who do you say I am try asking that to your brother or sister because it is so difficult for people to pick you up and lift you up in your spirit they'd rather talk negative about you than to pick you up when last did somebody come to you brother I'm so grateful to be associated with you to walk this walk with you I'm so grateful that I have you in my life I'm so grateful to to fight this battle beside you I know you got my back I've got your back brother I'm praying for you amen amen amen yes some people like feel like right now I'm talking in [Music] tongues
