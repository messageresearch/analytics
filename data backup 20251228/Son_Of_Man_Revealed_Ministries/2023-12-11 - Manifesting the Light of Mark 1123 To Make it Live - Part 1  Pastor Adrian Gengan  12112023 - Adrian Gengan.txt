Lord is the greatest privilege we have in this hour yes Lord the greatest privilege greatest honor amen so we welcome you in the house of the Lord amen pray you be blessed with the word we can go straight to our scripture amen this morning I'd like to speak I may not get to the entire message but just speaking a thought called manifesting the life of Mark 11:23 to make it live amen amen now we know Mark 11:23 is the power of the spoken word that is only given to a certain class of people thank you amen it couldn't have come in any other age amen yes Lord hallelujah it couldn't have come at any other age any other time because it must come at the end of the age when Sons and Daughters of God are coming back into their position amen and only a certain amount of people can shine light upon that scripture and make that scripture live amen so we speaking on manifesting the light of Mark 11:23 to make it live amen we'll read Mark 5:14 amen praise the Lord amen Mark 5 and ver14 says you are the light of the world amen amen not you are the light in your own family not you are the light in your church you are the light of the world so you know that when you are depending on light you can't have stage one stage two stage three stage four load shadding yes if people are depending on your light you can't afford to have load sheding yes amen you are the light of the world because if you shut down your light the world is in darkness yes amen a city on a hill cannot be hidden neither do people light a lamp and put it under a basket instead they set it on a stand and it gives light to everyone in the house am Amen in the same way let your light shine before men amen amen in the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and glorify your father in Heaven amen is everybody reading this and understanding it amen hallelujah it's Mark chapter 5 if you didn't get it in the same way let your light shine before men that they may see your good deeds and glorify your father in Heaven so the one that is Shining Light has Works following them amen yes amen the Lord had blessings to the reading of his word you may be seated amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen glory be to his name amen praise the Lord I'm just allowing you to settle down and allow the spirit of God to take control of the service right now because I don't want you to be distracted amen I don't want you to be distracted with anything forget about what will happen after the service right now we have come here for the word of God Amen and the word of God is light so if you're here in darkness the word of God can bring light to your situation bring Deliverance to your situation you may say well everything is going fine for me right now why don't you just preach a good cheerful message and we go on tomorrow you could be in darkness yes amen tomorrow the darkness of sickness could come over your body and you don't know where to turn on the light but let the word shine light upon you this morning that you'll know how to operate amen hallelujah amen praise the Lord the the reason why escom gives you load shedding they do not have enough reserves how many of you know that amen they don't have enough Reserve Reserve energy so they load shed to meet the demand amen so we want you to store enough Reserve energy so even when the demand gets great you are still able to meet the need amen amen amen amen amen hallelujah amen some of you need to switch your engines on this morning amen hallelujah amen amen hallelujah and get your faith Praise on get your Hallelujah on amen hallelujah amen get your best Amen on otherwise the Holy Spirit can only work in an atmosphere of Faith amen otherwise I'll be standing here this morning and giving you a good intellectual message you may even be blessed with it but there will be no life in it amen hallelujah so the prophet of God tells us what is light the Vindicated spoken word of God is light amen yes amen is he saying the written word only the Vindicated spoken word of God is what light is outside of that there is no light you can't lighten the Earth with flashlights amen it takes God's word that made manifest the son amen hallelujah praise the Lord now I'd like to background it a bit and take some types and shadows and show you amen in the Bible how when light comes it scatters all Darkness away no matter what the situation amen we can start with King David you know he's a young boy he's not even King as yet and his father sends him into a situation that even his father is not aware of because his father is sending him some cheese some bread some cakes to take to his brothers amen according to the civilians they are thinking that these are courageous men in Israel but they don't know the picture on the battle scene yes if they had known they wouldn't be sending cakes they wouldn't be sending cheese they'd be sending reinforcements amen they probably will be sending more military weapons but David father is revealing that according to civilian life they think that everything is fine and the Israel army is a powerful force to be reckon with so young David is sent to go to that Army but when he comes into the army he sees the armies of Israel are defeated by fear amen and if I could type it this way 200 million demons had possessed them and was let loose and were possessed the fullest Army but not only the Philistine army they had also possessed the Israel army amen you know the king of Israel Soul was possessed with demon powers amen hallelujah amen and we said that fear had gripped the Israel army but what is fear fear is a spirit yes amen and that spirit is demon powers yes amen the Bible says God has not given us the spirit of fear amen amen but of a sound mind amen hallelujah so no matter what situations we facing in life if you face it by fear you are already defeated yes that's right the moment you are presented with a challenge the moment you are presented with a situation be it amen your health be it your finances be it your job be it in your family or relationships whatever it is the moment you meet it with fear you are already defeated yes that's one of great Satan's greatest weapons [Music] fear and we find that he had possessed Goliath amen you remember it was Christ Through the Ages being portrayed so yeah was if we can say Satan incarnate in Goliath amen he had found a man to become incarnate in and he told call them slaves of an Hebrew God Amen if you can find one man to challenge me don't sacrifice your entire Army send one man let us settle it on the battlefield and whoever wins amen will be the winner of the battle amen what they were doing negotiating with the Enemy when the land belonged to them hello every promise in the book Belongs to You amen every chapter every verse every line there's no room for negotiations amen amen yes Lord a natural Israel wants to make a two-state uh party deal there they want to settle for Palestinian territory and they want to settle for Israeli territory amen but I want you to know that spiritual Israel will not partition the land will not divide the land amen he will take every bit of ground Hallelujah yes Lord thank you Jesus amen Wednesday we were speaking about strongholds and how to defeat strongholds amen and we showed you how Gaza means a strong City and that's the the contention right now the strip of Gaza and we showed you how amas means violence and how Jesus is saying that the kingdom of God suffered violence and the violent take it by force yes amen hallelujah we're trying to show you how the Christian life is not a Bed of Roses amen yes but it's a battle daily it's a battle amen you must overcome by the word of God Amen we are not saying that you're not going to face trials you're not going to face situations you're not going to face problems in your life but we are saying God has given us the word of God to overcome every situation to overcome every trial in your life thank you Lord amen thank you so we find here David is a man who's coming now in obedience to his father because we find the character there's a character required to operate in mark 11:2 3 amen it doesn't just take anybody to operate in this you have to be under Authority you have to know how to operate in obedience amen David was a man who was anointed by the prophet but he never moved ahead of God's time and season amen David never moved ahead of God's time and season even though he was anointed he didn't walk into the camp that day saying oh you old man you you backslid uh demon possessed people let me show you who I am I'm the anointed of God he didn't start to tell them that Samuel anointed him he was going to let his Works show forth who he was he was going to let his light shine before men amen amen I I I don't know if you're actually so interested in the message that you forgotten to say Amen this morning I don't know what's going on here amen hallelujah I don't know if you want to show the the visitors how well disciplined you are amen hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord Pentecostal people amen people filled with the Holy Ghost amen are on fire for God amen amen they are full with the Praises of God they full amen the praise can't stop from their lips amen amen hallelujah praise the Lord now I ask you to take the remote control that operates the gift and the anointing away from me and I put it in your hands and I tell you you operate the gift this morning amen yes amen yes Lord because if the gift is operating from the pulpit here I tell you it's going to be a fearful thing sword Blood Sweat and Tears amen hallelujah but if you can walk on the gift of God and say Lord speak to me according to my need you see if we if we come into the service not realizing that we possess the the ability to operate the gift that even if the pastor has another thought in mind another sermon in mind he can change the entire sermon and meet me at my point of need and we have testimony sitting here today how God is doing that yes amen amen look at our God case in point David was going to meet the need about some homemade food that would remind them about home but God was meeting another need amen God was turning that situation around yes Lord amen because of a man who was in obedience because of a man amen who was willing to walk after God's Own Heart amen yes he said I will not raise my hand against God's anointed amen so when he fire goes into this Camp he's walking into a very hostile situation he's finding the army of Israel trembling in their boots he's finding that they are possessed with fear amen but here's a man who's not swayed by what he sees here's a man who has ambition yes you young men you young women have some ambition in your life amen even our Prophet says I like a man with ambition I like a man with goals a man who knows what he wants amen yes don't just sit around idle saying oh whatever will be will be the first thing David asked the king is what will the King give the man who will slay this Philistine amen have an ambition Hallelujah he knew that in his current state and condition amen he couldn't raise his level of life in the Israel but he was going to find out what will the king of Israel do for me amen oh thank you and it seemed like an inviting proposition because he said he's going to give the King's Daughter and he's going to raise you up in the Kingdom amen hallelujah am amen praise the Lord know what you're fighting for is what I am Telling You Yes amen David wants you to know what am I fighting for what is the reward of all of this amen and we are finding out that the ones who overcome in this day and overcome Satan and all of his schemes there's a reward to the believer who overcomes and that reward you that overcome this latest and church age I'm going to make you sit on my throne even as I overcame and sat on my father's Throne that is the highest level you can raise up to give God praise amen yes thank you Lord to be seated with the King thank you Lord amen hallelujah amen yeah we find David now you know the story about King David and how amen he couldn't be equipped with what they were offering him amen military might military equipment military training amen he had to rely on his own experiences amen God has been taking you through experiences amen in your time in your season in the backside of the desert God has presented to you Lions he's presented to you bears and he's presented to you wild beast that were coming after your sheep but God has been preparing you the backside of the desert to face your goliaths amen yes amen so don't take the days of small beginning lightly all those afflictions you've been going through was test for you to move you to the next level amen a test is not if you in grade one they give you a test to promote you to grade two the test is not to fail you the test is to measure if you have learned what they have taught you and then to move you to the next grade so when God brings you through a test amen start rejoicing amen because when you overcome the test he's going to take you to the next level oh thank you Lord thank you thank you amen praise the Lord amen so yeah King David I'm going to move ahead in the story The only thing he told the king I need is a sling and some Stones yes amen we know the stone Stones represented the word of God Amen he took five Stones which is g r a c e he was going by grace and he was going by f a i t h Faith amen hallelujah hallelujah amen why you saying grace and Faith yes because he was using both hands amen amen he had a sling and he had a stone but David couldn't use the stone alone amen amen yes he couldn't use the word Alone come on now Hallelujah yes amen he needed a sling amen that's sling types the Holy Ghost the sling types the Dynamics amen that must coming into the church what is the Holy Ghost to Prophet is the Holy Ghost is the action in you yes amen the sling is the action to propel the stone amen what is the Holy Ghost to feed of the word the Holy Ghost feeds on the word amen so God has been equipping this end time people with the word and placing them into a position where they have the power of the spoken word but you to require the Dynamics of the Holy Ghost to come and Quicken that word and bring it to life amen thank you Lord I tell you there's a character required for this operation amen amen praise the Lord so David takes the sling and he takes the stone he takes the word and he takes the Holy Ghost and he uses both of it because the Dynamics must work together with the mechanics amen he couldn't operate with a sling alone he couldn't operate with the word alone he had to have both amen and has this as this gol is making threats to him what am I trying to show you in the midst of gross darkness in the camp of Israel here was the manifested light coming into the presence of the Israel army coming to shine for light and when light comes into the place all Darkness must flee amen yes Lord amen yes amen amen even the children of Israel operating under fear had to put all their hopes and their faith in this boy called David and they were all waiting with bited breath wondering what will happen to Young David all they heard was the testimonies about how he slew a lion and how he slew a bear they had never seen any physical evidence of it so they had to have faith to believe David's word amen they wasn't feeding David to Goliath so I'm showing you that David had a Ministry to build up their faith to believe in him amen that he was the manifested light yes and God was about to prove it in the midst of the Israel army and all the Philistine armies that yeah was David who's going to bring the scriptures to life and shine light on the scriptures and he is going to be the manifested light for that day amen so David is saying I'm going to feed you I'm going to do this to you sorry I mean Goliath is telling him but yet David Rises up in faith something gets a hold of him and he says this day you've defied the armies of the Living God today I will feed your body to the fowls of the air and I'm going to take your head off amen David didn't even have a sword amen but he's going with faith the power of the spoken word what is Mark 11323 if you say if you say to this amen you believe your own words you believe what is coming out of your own mouth believe in your heart that you have already received what you have said and you shall have it amen now I want you to know for those of you that may be thinking that David had some sort of word from the Lord David didn't have any word from the Lord the prophet Samuel or Nathan didn't come to him and say David the Lord told me that he's going to deliver Goliath into your hand this man had to march in his anointing this man had to march in time and season this man had to shine every time light is shine upon the Scripture it manifests that scripture and brings that scripture to life that's what I'm showing you amen hallelujah these people like to grind your next door hey they only wait for church time we can know why the devil you see that's the devil's head on the grinding stone this morning amen hallelujah Anan can't handle it amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen so he needed mechanics and Dynamics and here he goes marching towards Goliath amen he wasn't ducking and he wasn't diving he was marching with purpose he knew was the manifested light going towards Goliath amen I tell you don't be afraid of your Mountain amen go towards your mountain with faith amen amen advance and go knowing that the Lord is with you you haven't been equipped all these years for you to now question whether the Lord be with you he said I will never leave you nor forsake you amen yes Lord thank you Jesus thank you Father thank you Lord and here he goes taking the sling and whichever way he threw that sling the power of the Holy Ghost came and caught that stone amen and it moved it at I don't know how many thousand miles per hour until amen it moved through every armor that Goliath had and it struck him on the head sunk deep inside the head amen amen anything that will raise itself against the knowledge of Jesus Christ amen hit him in the head yes amen and here Goliath fell down to the ground amen what do you think happened in the army of Israel huah Fai arose amen a great shout of Praise amen they gave the Lord a shabbach amen hallelujah Judah began to rise amen the tribe of Judah began to say blow the trumpet in Zion sound the alarm on my Holy Mountain say the Lord let's advance and go forth amen David had raised up the faith of that Israel army and they went forth and slew the entire Philistine Army amen yes amen and God had raised up a David amen amen hallelujah God is Raising you up in this hour young David amen amen hallelujah God is Raising you up for time and season amen amen praise the Lord amen amen wonderful thank oh he's worthy amen so don't let your light amen become dim Shine Your Light at all times amen amen we find here God in the beginning said what what was he doing God said let there be light so it must have been foggy dismal dark as the world was turning and when God knew that he had need of light what he said the seed was already in the Earth because he had planted it in there now he needed light to bring forth that seed to make that seed live because the seed was already there God has already put the seed of eternal life in you oh yes thank you Lord what we are doing through the preaching of the Gospel he shining the Gospel Light so that seed can germinate to life amen amen so no matter what situation you find yourself in how dark and how dismal condition you are you may be in sin you may be in unbelief it could be all dark and gloomy in there but let the light of God's word shine one time upon your heart yes Lord you will leave every denomination yes you will leave every man-made religion yes amen you will leave your worldly Traditions you will leave your smoking you will leave your gambling you will leave your alcohol and you will come and respond to the light amen Lord thank you because the seed can't help but germinate to life amen so God said let there be light amen amen now we know that God had to believe his own word and that's how light was manifested God had to believe his own word amen so God separated the light from the darkness what am i showing you there was time and season in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth full stop we don't know how long that was but God waited for time and season amen something had happened that had caused the world to become formless void dark but God is waiting for time and season yes and he says let there be light Amen in the midst of your Darkness God is saying let there be light in the midst of your situation God is saying let there be light in the midst of your sickness God is saying let there be light in the midst of our unemployment God is saying let there be light yes Lord amen and that word has got to materialize when God said let there be light amen it wouldn't have meant nothing until it materialized until the light came forth striking through that Darkness amen and all Darkness had to disappear am amen amen so God's word is the one that separated light from darkness and the word of God made manifest always separate the light from the darkness that is why as soon as you accept the light of God's word as soon as you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior you become the light of the world and all Darkness has got to separate all unbelief has got to separate all worldliness has got to separate because you have responded to lighten Lord amen if if darkness is still residing within you if there's still some unbelief within you you need to say Lord let the light of your word come and shine and take away all unbelief take away all Darkness from my life amen amen amen amen praise the Lord the reason why you know sometimes your mothers called you and they tell you open up the curtains open up the windows and let some light come into the room amen I'm telling you that you got some doors in your heart that are shut to the power of God shut to the light of God that's why darkness resonates in your heart yes but the the Holy Ghost is here the great enforcer this morning to come and knock at your door this morning and tell you open up yes Lord let me in yes Lord amen people can rise up with this that and the other but when the king light of the Bible the word of God Rises all superstitions denominational fanaticisms and things spread away and it shows just exactly what it is it shuts out all other light amen yes amen hallelujah that's what the word of God will do shut out every other thing shut out every false light yes amen amen praise the Lord Jesus said let every man's word be a lie and mine be truth amen so Jesus word we know is superior over man's word so we must always take God's word over man's word how many of us practice that in our life we always take can I see your hands we always take God's word over man's word and man's opinion and word come second to the word of God even if it means us losing friendship you know sometimes you get uncles in the family who everybody looks up to or sometimes you get a father figure in the family or somebody oh no we always go to this Guru when we need advice we must go to mama you know which Mama I'm talking about we always go to him amen so even if his word contradicts the Bible you always take Mama's word but the word of God must always have preeminence amen amen hallelujah yes amen the word of God Father's word is of highest value in our lives amen amen so here the prophet of God Will Tell Us in any age in each age God for told us what would take place in each age he says the only thing he needs in the manifestation of the light of God is the manifestation of the light of God upon the scripture to make it live for that age now let us sink in deep as much as I'm trying to preach a very basic I'm also giving you nuggets here amen amen cuz I'm preaching to an ABC class and also an algebra class amen so I need you to to catch certain truths so he says the only thing he needs is the manifestation of the light of God upon that scripture to make it live for that age amen yes God has already opened up certain scriptures in the Bible that could not be manifested in any other age except your age amen and you are the one that must light up that scripture amen you are the one that's got to bring that scripture to life amen let's put Mark 11:23 this is the focal point of our scripture reading this is what we are talking about Sons and Daughters of God coming back to their position amen hallelujah yes stop complaining speak amen yes stop complaining about your situation speak what you want am that's our ought to be condition that's what God made man to be God did you hear God complaining when the world was dark did you hear him calling all the angels and saying look how dark the world is look how void the world is look how formless the world is look there's no trees look there's no animal life God doesn't do any of that God speaks what he wants amen and we are Sons and Daughters of God Amen we must speak what we want we must speak like what our father speaks yes it says verily verily I say unto you that whatsoever whosoever does that include us how many of us can agree that includes me I'm a whosoever I'm not a nobody amen I'm a whosoever ever shall say unto this mountain that mountain could be anything in your life now does he say there that if your pastor says to the mountain does he say if your bishop or your Deacon or somebody says to the mountain whosoever shall say to this mountain amen be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea so learn from there you need to tell it what to do and where to go yeah amen say Satan you've Afflicted my family for too long the spirit of poverty is upon this home for too long I'm casting you out and I'm telling you never to return because the power of the Living God lives in this house amen tell it what to do and where to go be thou removed and cast into the sea some of us have hurts that's a mountain in our life some of us have have amen have built up complexes in our in ourselves that's a mountain in our lives we need to speak to that mountain and tell it what to do and where to go amen if it's unforgiveness we need to move into the sea of forgetfulness come on now I I know none of you have unforgiveness in your hearts here but I'm telling you if there's ever a situation where you become bitter and you have unforgiveness in your heart because you know the day the the greatest test you will get is from your loved ones from your friends and your families amen man the greatest test you will get is from that and it depends how you relate to them can you operate in the love of God can you forgive them Jesus said amen you need to forgive them 70 * 7 yes amen amen hallelujah amen amen Jesus said you must forgive them 70 time 7 Jesus didn't say show them who you are amen Jesus didn't tell you to go now and start training get some muscle let me sort them out amen hallelujah amen Jesus didn't tell you remember the days of your youth when they used to call you Bush knife Bobby let that Spirit rise up within you Jesus didn't tell you to do that what did Jesus tell you to do forgive them he says if they slap you on one Sheek offer them the other even if they hit you on the other one he says take it you know these days they Brave they'll hit you if you offer them the other one amen now but but this is this is how a Christian is amen maybe we haven't practiced it but Jesus says let your light shine before men how are they going to see something different about us if we act like the world yes amen If We R like the world yes and some of us have a vocabulary that only comes out when the anger comes out that tongue ain't nobody heard tongues like that hey man you know every swear word according to the alphabets you start you think you're in kindergarten you start saying your alphabets hey but a Christian pulls out ABC see always believe Christ amen in the midst of my trial in the midst of my circumstance I believe Christ amen how many of you know that that person that's tormenting you has a demon power and you can you can bind that demon power in them yes one time there was a man who came to the prophet of God on the stage this man was known for beating up preachers he was so possessed with the power power of demons and here he came one night and the prophet says that the policeman ran away the deacons were scared shaking in the boots and the ministers were scared on the stage and this this man big-sized man came to the prophet he says I'm going to break every bone in your body the prophet just stood there and he recognized the demon amen the prophet didn't say 6 seconds SM train me all you know the prophet was a boxer and he said 6C Smith trained in you know what 6C Smith means that guy was a boxer and he knocked everyone out in 6 seconds am man this one wasn't operating by 6 seconds this one is operating by seventh Dimension he had control of all things he said today you will bow before me because you have challenged the spirit of the Living God Amen yes amen you can speak to your boss like that because you have challenged a son and daughter of God today you will bow before me you will go back to your office and you'll consider giving me an increase are we speaking about if you say and don't doubt Amen in fact I want you to okay you don't need to go so far right amen but you get my point you can speak to the situation but use wisdom now amen so here Jesus says don't doubt in your heart showing you how to operate back in your position don't doubt in your heart but believe those things which he thinking he is saying power of the spoken word he is saying shall come to pass and he shall have whatsoever he saith amen even if you don't see it instantly you've got to believe that the word words you have spoken you're going to have what you have said yes amen praise the Lord amen I am telling you there's a special class of people to light up this scripture you know the prophet's experience when he was how hunting and how he couldn't understand the scripture and the prophet the Lord told him you come here to hunt the squirrels and there's no squirrels he says why don't you speak amen you know the story and now you began to speak and say I want a squirrel to come up this way go up onto the tree and stand there and as you spoke it materialized you see all we are taught from birth is to rely on our five senses see taste feel smell and year we are not taught when we in school that we have a six sense which is called Faith amen and we can operate like God because we were created in the image and after the likeness of God that God made us an amateur God over the Earth that he said you can have dominion he says multiply replenish the Earth and have dominion over the Earth amen how many of you believe our God is a god of multiplication amen our God is a god of multiplication right there in Genesis 1 he's telling you to multiply so a believer's voice when he speaks is a voice of multiplication come on now I don't think you're getting this amen this is your sunship Authority amen when you speak you operate under multiplication yes amen Luke 6:38 says give and it shall come back to you good measure pressed down shaken together and running over amen amen yes that's right Hallelujah you see in the Kingdom of man we have thought that amen hallelujah that 20 - 10 is 10 that's thinking according to the caral mind but in the kingdom of God if you have 20 and you give 10 it's going to come back to you multiplied amen amen it's going to come back to you hundredfold amen hallelujah yes praise the Lord yes right so 20us 10 in the kingdom of God is 100 I'm teaching you spiritual mathematics you don't believe me me did God have one son in John 3:16 God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son amen yes now when he gave did he look like God was losing his only begotten son come on now did he look like he was losing his only begotten son but he was giving his son am but when God gives he's going to operate according to his own law amen God swld his own son into the Earth amen and it looked like God was going to be a loser because he only had one son but when this one son was swn into the Earth amen except a corn of weed dies and is sewn into the ground it abides alone but if it dies it brings forth much fruit so when this one son was given by God it says God so loved the world he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life what was he doing sowing the one son and there was going going to come a multiplication of Sons and Daughters of God give God praise yes so our God is a god of multiplication amen yes amen hallelujah so don't ever think that when you are giving something into the kingdom and and in the Kingdom beside your tithes and beside your offering you can also give to your brothers you can give to your sisters but you are sowing in faith and let me tell you something you are reaping Eeps of reward and if coming back to you in multiplication when you give to the poor when you give to people that can't reward you the same way yes that's right amen that's correct amen when you can give to somebody who can't repay you yeah oh it's coming good measure pressed down shaken together and running over give and it will come back to you when you give give to the Lord how many if you know if you want love you got to S love if you want peace you got to sow peace amen these laws apply on the earth and you can operate these laws you see they are laws of men and they are laws of God and only Sons and Daughters of God can tap into the supernatural laws amen so whatsoever you say if you can believe in your heart confess with your mouth and believe that you're going to have what you have said you shall have it amen but you got to wait time and season amen hallelujah you speak a word now you don't see it you still believe it by faith Abraham staggered not at the promise of God but was strong in faith knowing that the one who promised it was sure to bring it to pass amen hallelujah amen I say get some get some hope in your chest the prophet says get some hope in your chest because what is faith faith is the substance of things hope for what is your hope hope is your desire hope is is your imagination hope is the things that you desire in your heart did God have Amen in the back part of his mind did God have thoughts did God have imagination did God have it in the back part of his mind yes but then God then moved in time and season according to Faith and whatsoever was in his back part of his mind whatsoever was in his heart he spoke and he said let there be and it came to pass I'm telling you get some hope back in your chest amen don't be without hope don't be without purpose yes amen thank you God wants you to have a ambition God's sons and daughters are not lazy people lying around with no ambition amen yes

sense of humor Jesus had a sense of humor amen hallelujah amen God's people are happy people yes amen the joy of the Lord is our strength amen amen so sister Ruth amen just to share a brief testimony so it was in 2019 it was just before Co these Co demons were coming around and that she was diagnosed and she was told that she had a first AR attack many of you are aware of that amen so when the doctor she says when the doctor walked in and and told her that she had an heart attack she was smiling at the doctor and the doctor said you just had an AR attack what you smiling about amen and sister R told her I believe I'm already healed amen amen hallelujah power of a positive confession amen she didn't speak the negative and asked how many arteries are blocked she declared like we said Jesus said let there be light God said let there be light she said I'm already healed so when sister had the second heart attack after she says they did the second angiogram and the doctor said they had to do a triple heart bypass triple that means three of your main arteries are clogged amen and there's no way they can put a stint or blow out that blockage they've got to bypass that blockage so do an do an operation some of you have been through that you know what what they're talking about so sister Ruth says she always believed that God had his hand upon her amen and every time she went to the hospital to book an appointment for the bypass you all know sometime we were getting frustrated too they kept telling her they were postponing it this is not right that is not right we can't do it now amen but God is was in control am amen so when sister Ruth went this last June for a last appointment now in the interim you got to remember that the church was praying sister Ruth was praying you know many times we called here and we even believe that the Lord has given her a new heart amen hallelujah amen the lord gave somebody new eyes the Lord caus somebody's arm to grow in front of them yes amen when they cut the that soldier's ear off the Lord restored his ear amen but according to your faith what you believe if your heart is Damaged no problem God can give you a new heart if your lung is damaged no problem God can give you a new lung but you've got to believe God Amen so we've been believing that the Lord will give her a new heart amen and there's no need for the bypass so when she went for that all the x-rays and everything was clear this is last June now and they told her you don't have to go for the bypass let's give God praise amen so s's Thanksgiving is that based on that she wants to thank the Lord for her healing amen she says also I'm reading this here so you can see I'm not thanking myself here also would like to thank my pastor and the church for praying for me i' would also like to thank my neighbors for being there for me amen so let's give God a good hand up of Praise amen praise the Lord amen so our God has been moving for those of you maybe unfamiliar we've seen where God has touched and healed people living Witnesses sitting right here here's brother Joshua with a he was struggling with a nerve problem sister he laye there suffering
