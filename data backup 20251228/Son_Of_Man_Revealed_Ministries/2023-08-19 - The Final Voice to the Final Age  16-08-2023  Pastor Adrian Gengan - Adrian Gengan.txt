God curses that entire generation that came out of Egypt because of what takes place here and the Lord speak unto Moses saying send thou men that they may search the land of Canaan Canaan is the type of the Holy Ghost so search the holy ghost search the scriptures which I give unto the children of Israel of every tribe of their fathers and shall he send him man everyone a ruler among them and Moses by the Commandment of the Lord sent them from the Wilderness of Quran all those men were heads of the children of Israel so I'm not going to read it but you can read all the men that were chosen right how many spies were chosen amen we know they were changed spies right so we come to verse 16 now we don't we don't want to read to save time he says these are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land and Moses called O'Shea the son of none Yeshua right so that's Joshua they just call his name differently there and Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto them get you up this way Southward and go up into the mountain and see the land what it is and the people that dwell it therein whether they be strong or weak few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad and what the cities they be that dwell in whether Intense or in strongholds and what the land is whether it be fat or lean whether they be whipped they're in or not and be of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes so they went up and searched the land from the Wilderness of Zinn unto their op as men came to Amat and they ascended by the south and came unto Ebron where ayaman cheshai and Talma the children of Enoch were so these are giants in the land and they came unto the brook of ishkol and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bathed between two upon his staff and they brought off the pomegranates and of the figs the place was called The Brook escort because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from dense and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days now that 40 days is very important because God cursed them according to he says the number of days that you spend searching the land it shall be the number of years that you're wondering in the wilderness right that's how they got determined the number of years they were one in the wilderness and they went and came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel and showed the fruit of the land I'm trying to skip here so we can get to the main point and they told him we came unto the land where would thou ascended us and surely it flow through milk and Ani and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it amen but the men went up with himself we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that heated up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and they were and and there we saw the Giants the sons of Enoch which came which come of the Giants and we were in our own side as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight and all the children of is this is the next chapter now and all the congregation lifted up their voice and cried and the people wept that night you see what wrong leaders can do amen this is typing the denominational church now putting fear into the people not able to possess the land of the inheritance which is the Holy Ghost which is the message of the hour and all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron and the old congregation said unto them with God that we had died in the land of Egypt or what God have we died in the wilderness and wherefore at the Lord brought us unto this land to Fall by the sword that our wives and our children should be prayed were not better for us to return into Egypt and they said one to another let us make a caption and let us return into Egypt then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the Assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel and Joshua the son of none and Caleb the son of jephina which were of them that searched the land rent their clothes and they spake unto the company of the children of Israel saying the land which we pass through to search it is an exceeding good land amen if the Lord Delight in us then he will bring us into this land and give it to us a land which floweth with milk and honey only Rebel not he against the Lord neither fear he the people of the land for they are bred for us their defense is departed from them and the Lord Is With Us fear them not amen but all the congregation bathe stoned them with stones and the glory of the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of the congregation before the children of Israel so amen you may be seated the Lord and blessings to the reading of his word hallelujah amen praise the Lord what a scene amen when God had done so much for them and yet they find themselves in this predicament amen so we find here and I want to speak a little bit on the final voice amen because we are the final voice to the final age amen so if we have the final voice to the final age like the prophet says the question we need to ask ourselves is how are we using our voice amen because we have limited time on the Earth yes yes so we need to be able to use our voice effectively yeah amen and God has an expectation of us in this hour to use our voice and not to be silent amen so that's why Matthew Chapter 5 says let your light shine before men amen now if you notice Joshua and Caleb they didn't change their opinion they didn't change their voice but in the midst of a great outcry from the unbelief coming out of the camp they raised their voice and they stood firm on the word of God what were they doing letting their light shine before men amen so we know that a voice is used to speak a message to communicate to influence someone or to convey a message so we can use our voice in many ways we know that we can use our voice Amen to to feel to express how we feel we can greet someone with our voice we can encourage someone we can build up but with the same voice we can also tear down amen because our Words of Power yes amen hallelujah so are we using our voice to spread fear anxiety worry stress negativity [Music] how are we using our voice amen now I love the way you prayed brother Ramesh the prayer request went forth and you didn't say Lord that sister came heal Sister Kim I thank you Lord that you've already done it amen amen amen so what's the progression now because remember the teaching has been coming watch your confession watch what you pray believe that you've already received it so we thank the Lord that he's already done it amen because we call those things which are not as though they are right right you remember when God is looking at Abraham and he tells him now he doesn't even have a child yet he comes in he says I know this man that he shall teach his children God is already seeing him full of children amen so whatever you're praying for believe that you have already received it speak about it in the past tense by his stripes we were healed amen amen hallelujah so we find we had a voice that proceeds the final voice which is the voice of the seventh angel amen and he wants to reveal the mysteries of God yes yes Hallelujah amen we should never forget that fact it shouldn't be something casual there's no other Church upon the face of the Earth right now that has a pillow of fire you can put on the slide amen not a cloud yes Hallelujah there's no other church that has this Vindication yes we are the only church on the earth Amen in the final Exodus that has a pillow fire and a cloud yes thank you Father amen we should not be shy about the message this message came Vindicated yes amen sometimes we hang around too much of unbelief amen hallelujah we need to get away from all unbelief be like Joshua and Caleb thank you Lord amen hallelujah and sometimes it's our very family members that are full of unbelief and we love them so much that we get caught up in the unbelief it's not we're influencing them they influence us we want to see how close we can get to to entertain them amen to appease them without offending them amen be like Joshua and Caleb stand your ground amen declare the word of the Lord amen your very presence will bring condemnation to them and in fact if you are shining your light before men they cannot stand your presence if they are loving your presence and something is wrong Jesus said if they hate me they will hate you oh thank you Lord thank you Lord to be like Jesus amen to be like Jesus Jesus didn't want everyone Amen to love him he loved the word and Jesus spoke the word amen amen therefore they hated him amen hallelujah so the message that we have heard amen came by one the seventh angel and the Bible says he that happened here to hear what the seventh angel is saying let him hear what the spirit is saying amen so the one that has an ear to ear is the one that receives it into his heart we gotta learn Jesus teaching now yes the one that was sown in the heart the good ground because you must believe in your heart amen so the one that's believing the word in his heart becomes a generator we are all generators amen amen soon they might switch on the generator what are we what is that generator producing energy electricity what's the right word for the Caleb it's electricity right that will feed into that box and it will give us light so it generates producing that energy we become a generator of faith the word must fall into ears that here yes and when Faith falls into a ear that has the ability to hear amen thank you I'm telling you you're a free generator you're a rare species very few people can generate Faith perfect faith in this hour amen that isn't here to hear what the seventh angel has said oh Hallelujah you know when you hear that seventh Angels Voice or you hear that eagle screaming amen and something in your heart just tugs and you say oh hallelujah amen amen and that voice when you hear it amen you you look up and you hear Mama Eagle calling you to come up a little higher yeah amen and when Faith cometh by the hearing of that word within you start to generate a faith amen you start to generate faith faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the word of God amen say this over yourself now I am a generator of perfect free perfect Faith amen hallelujah some are generating imperfect Faith because they have an imperfect word they have a partial work amen if they are receiving Luther's word that's the kind of faith that they could that they will generate adjust ification faith amen that's all that they can generate if they are under the influence of Wesley all that they can generate is sanctification amenity all they can generate is Gifts of speaking in tongues amen but now we have come to The Showdown hey amen amen where there's a group of people that have listened to the voice of the seventh angels let me tell you something if you are if you are true predecided seed of God there's only one thing that you can produce by listening to The Prophet's voice that's perfect thing yes yes if something else is coming out there's something wrong with you there's something wrong with your generator you need a service amen and maybe you don't have enough fuel yes amen you need to refuel yes amen don't be one of those foolish virgins who are running out of oil in this hour amen you need to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah because that Holy Ghost now will take that word amen hallelujah yes it will teach you all things amen so we find these people the children of Israel had come so far they had seen the pillow fire they had seen the cloud but they came to a point where that didn't impress him anymore they have seen the mighty Vindication of God how we have delivered them from the Egyptians these people had seen it yes but somehow along the way they are forgotten and let me tell you it's not long in the journey here yes so quickly they've forgotten the supernatural and they started to find forth in the prophet they started to find fault in the cloud and the pillar of Fire God told him and he told him go into the Holy Ghost go into the word they came across amen Mark 16 and they said no the days of Miracles is passed yes amen amen they came there to Malachi chapter 4 verse 5 and 6 and they says no that was John amen they come there to Revelation 10 7 and they say that's the seventh trumpeting angel and Caleb says no you're not reading it the wrong way amen hallelujah amen amen only Eagle see the word Moses said get up into the mountain amen and we are better than Exodus prophet in the same time who's gone up into the mountain amen hallelujah this is no water Cloud this is formed by seven angels amen amen you're going to believe that yeah it's won by seven angels Hallelujah the Angels himself was his weak amen amen amen praise the Lord hallelujah and that pillow fire amen hallelujah oh aren't you glad that the things we read in the Bible we can see visibly with our own eyes yes amen amen hallelujah glory be to his name so we are a faith generating unit amen Ryobi has got nothing on us the amount of power that we can produce amen is enough to feed the whole of eskom the whole of South Africa them amen the amount of power that you can generate the amount of faith that you can generate can feed the whole of South Africa with no load shedding amen come on now amen no two-hour load shedding amen praise the Lord amen so the result of the message of the hour is going to produce perfect faith in the people it must produce perfect faith in the people amen so when we speak and when we use our voice out of the abundance of our hearts the heart that's sown with the perfect word that's generating perfect Faith out of our mouths we speak and we are sounding what a message of perfect faith amen no matter what condition you find people in always speak perfectly to them amen that's what you're called to do in this hour you are called to be a people that presents free to people amen hallelujah so our prophesying in this day like in Revelation 10 verse 11 prophesy again now must have an objective and it must have a motive amen and that the objective and the motive you must have it according to God's word otherwise why are you the final voice ask yourself then why are you prophesying what are you prophesying don't be professing the Bible says You must profess again he says You must prophesy again amen amen amen hallelujah so think about it we are the final Voice of Truth yes yes in a world of Lies look at these spies in a world of Lies Caleb and Joshua had to stand as the final Voice of Truth amen amen in this the 117th year of the church age God is raising up an army an army of Truth our army with a voice a army amen that's not afraid yeah yes these people were afraid they saw giants in the land amen the Giants didn't even threatened them they were observing them yes and they got fearful it's the 117th year of the church age and 60th year since the opening of the seals from 63 to 23. in 63 the angel of the Lord came down yes and in Exodus 23 verse 23 it says behold I send my angel before thee we are in the Third Exodus Church we are right at the time now where you must stand up to be counted yes yes the test is coming your way and they want to know what do you believe what do you believe about this what do you believe about it are you casual no amen hallelujah so we don't want to be a halfway Believers that's what these people were there comes certain part of the way and they decided that God's word was not good enough for them amen these people that come out in The Exodus that are Lefty nominations amen God has delivered us from denominationalism but some are saying let us raise up captions and go back to denominationalism amen and maybe we won't go all the way back we just create a denomination within the ranks of the message Hallelujah will create a denomination in the ranks of the message amen but there's a people there's a people within a people there's a group within the group there's a message within the message amen because not all message is message not all Israel is Israel amen there's a group in Israel where the true predestinated called out of God Amen by God's grace are you one of them amen amen amen I believe I'm one of them amen amen you must believe you're one of them God has called you in this hour amen don't let the devil tell you you're not called Don't Let The Devil whisper in your ears amen you tell him Satan get thee behind me amen the prophet says don't even negotiate with the devil just tell him get him behind me amen you know the power to resist the devil is in your hands amen you don't go and pray oh Lord this devil is worrying me the Bible says resist the devil and he will flee you resist the devil don't entertain the devil yeah amen amen amen if he's coming and he's telling you you're too weak tell him quote back the word amen hallelujah I can do all things to Christ who gives me strength amen if you if you've got a child a man who's not coping with something amen tell you say Lord I Thank you that my child can do all things through Christ amen will you give strength to your lord God amen hallelujah thank you amen it's time amen we raise up for who we are yes it's time amen we recognize who we are Amen in this year amen hallelujah God is Raising you up God is raising up to shine your light amen amen hallelujah we can't hide our light for too long we've been silent for too long amen we've been too reserved amen hallelujah but God has been filling us up amen now is the time now is the season amen first you rise up by faith and proclaim the revelation of our faith amen amen amen hallelujah you know I was I was thinking about these uh people there's two stories here and I was telling you about Genesis 12 how the first place that Abraham met the Lord was Inception and that's we building an altar unto the Lord and it became a holy place the first time that God had met Abraham in the journey and here we find amen if we maybe you can just put up the scripture you'll find it away quickly in Genesis 37 verse 12 yeah the prophet Jacob who is Israel is sending Joseph verse 12 right his father thinks the obsession amen like when Brandon came on the scene he expected them to be in a certain place in a certain level of Faith but they were not there they were not at the place of the altar they were not where God had thought they were amen amen they looked from the outside they looked like they were in the father's thinking he thought they were there and his Brethren went to feed their father's flock in session session was so God was God appointed place of meeting right it was the appointed place where God made Abram but they left session and in verse 13 it says and Israel said to Joseph do not thy Brethren feed the flocking session come I will send the unto them and he said unto him yeah am I am so he was willing to go to his brothers amen hallelujah amen and he said go I pray thee to see whether it be well with thy Brethren and with the flux and bring me word again and he sends him out of the veil of Ebron amen and came to session and a certain man and be and a certain man found him and behold he was wandering in the field and the man asked him saying what Seekers thou and he said I seeketh my brethren tell me I pray thee where they feed their flocks amen and the man said they are departed ends for I heard them say let us go to Dothan and Joseph went up to his Brethren and found him in Dothan amen hallelujah praise be to the Lord now it's important to note a few things here amen this didn't come back on praise the Lord praise the Lord so notice session is how many letters count quickly we need to go back to verse amen 13. seven letters how many is counting seven letters and Dothan is only letters so they left the place of seven letters and they went down to the six letters but daughter means two Wells so they left the one place to one true God and they went after other gods Dothan means two Wells double systems decrees laws customs and double feast they left a place where Abraham met the one true Living God and they went to Dothan amen many left Branham and they went after Graham amen if you read Genesis 18 you'll see the two angels going down to Sodom yes and Gomorrah that types Oral Roberts and Billy Graham yes every denominational denomination that I sprung up is products of their Ministry you'll see either they gone into the word of faith and the healing movement or they gone into the Baptist side of things amen products of the Ministries but there's a group that stayed with Abraham amen there's a group that come out of Abraham's Ministry amen we are the group that's come out of branham's ministry amen hallelujah now also very notable is Joshua Joshua 24 32 let's read this quickly this place has a special meaning and when Joseph satis turned back now remember they left Exodus they left Egypt right and the bones of Joseph which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt bury they went an impossible ground which Jacob bought of the sons of amor the father of session for a hundred pieces of silver and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph the very place his father sent him they buried him in the same spot amen so just because the ten have left and gone hmm to another place to double Wells amen hallelujah to Lord and decrees and custom the tradition of men we need to stay with the message of the hour amen our hearts have to be turned back to the faith of the fathers amen so the very place that Israel had sent Joseph is the very place that he was buried amen now what were the brothers trying to do suppress his dream suppress his vision amen so people won't be happy with your vision yeah not everyone will be happy with your vision not everyone will be happy with your confession amen hallelujah but you need to stay true to the vision Joseph was not deterred by the negativity of his brothers the brothers that walked with him yes yes amen the brothers that had gone on with him neither was Joshua and Caleb deterred by the testimony of the other brothers amen so it's coming a time now and I don't know about you but the pressure is all around the pressure to stand out ground there's unbelief all around us let us seeing spirit is creeping up all around us amen people want to be casual in the message people want to settle in the message amen hallelujah we have things going well for us amen look at how God has blessed us with the word look at how God has done this but God has so much more in store for us God wants us to inherit all of the promises of God and I'm afraid too many people don't want to go into the land of Canaan now suddenly the Holy Ghost looks like a giant to them they are fearful of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen can you say praise the Lord amen there's one thing that God hates amen let's read that next slide there yeah the prophet talking about his ego that wasn't afraid he was no coward God can't shoot cowards God cannot use cowards amen a comedy someone who's fearful yes a coyote is someone who is useless amen hallelujah amen when you believe God you've got to believe him with all that's in you God don't want anyone in the church to say oh yes praise the Lord I believe it and then on the outside I don't know I still feel bad amen amen we've got to learn these things Church yes yes we come into the prayer line we come to be prayed and then maybe outside somebody asks you then you've gone back to your negative report okay the first thing somebody offers you something oh you know my sugar levels are very high and this and that why are you confessing yeah yeah the prophet of God says we have faith and then we're sitting there in that day they had a different thing right what's the things for reflux now what are these things they drink Gaviscon and what else what flux how many flux amen he's omnipresent is omniscience amen hallelujah the prophet says you can't be sitting and saying I'm going to be having this thing but have that bottle next to you yeah you can't what is he saying you can't be double-minded yes God cannot use cowards and if there's anything in the sour I want to be used of the Lord I mean if you have the desire Lord use me if you can use anything Use Me Lord yes amen I don't want to be a coward I want to be full of faith in this hour amen is giving us Revelation because faith is a revelation for a reason let's believe him amen when we believe him let's really believe it so don't let's confess one thing and then on the outside we are showing another thing amen you've got to believe God in out everywhere you are believe God just the same amen got to believe him inside got to believe him outside everywhere you are believe God just the same now there's a responsibility on us being the final voice do you know we have to be teachers of the word if we are not doing that then we are not fulfilling our duty we're thinking prophesying he's going standing somewhere here he hear he you can teach people the word in all situations [Music] you teach them what the word of God says whether it's a Believer whether it's an unbeliever you teach them the word of God amen amen if somebody's got a problem and you know they're so helpless and hopeless you tell them you know what that's why Jesus Christ came yes we can't do things on our own but Jesus Christ came to die for our sins and he paid the price Amen on our behalf they say what do you mean they say well Jesus took my sin on the cross amen well why did he take my sin on the cross amen so that I can train my sick body for his well body amen yes amen I can treat my sadness for his Joy Hallelujah I can treat my unrighteous ways for his righteousness amen I can trade in my imperfection for his Perfection amen hallelujah amen I take my depression and my troubled mind for his sound mind amen that's what the cross was for amen if we can only realize the benefit of the Cross and when he said it is finished it is finished and we can live in resurrection power we can live with that anointing in our lives amen that we become a blessing to others we become the final voice to them the voice of Hope yes the Voice of Truth the voice of faith amen we ought to be so encouraging no matter the sinner because what did Jesus say you remember he spoke about that man who owed the Lord something some money and the Lord forgave him yes I think it was just let's call it a million he owed the Lord a million and the Lord forgave him then he had he accepted the Lord's forgiveness and he went away and somebody owed him a hundred and he didn't refuse to forgive them then the Lord says you Wicked person I forgave you but you can't forgive others yeah yeah amen now I want you to know if it had not been for the Lord Jesus Christ all of us would be going to hell amen amen none of us are standing here today based on our own righteousness my righteousness is like filthy amen hallelujah but when the Bible is saying let your light so shine before men that's Jesus shining to me amen amen if there's any good in me Jesus Christ yes yes amen I know amen I mean if you can testify that you are not the same person that you were since you met the Lord Jesus Christ you were born again baptized and filled with the Holy Spirit not the same never the same amen amen maybe you are a mean person maybe you were a nasty person maybe a man you were full of negativity and fear but now God has turned your life around amen people look at you and they can't believe the person you have become and they secretly admire you because What the Lord Has Done For You now if we can do that for you how much more do you become carriers of his grace amen how much more do we we become a conduit of his anointing we become a carrier of his anointing that wherever we go we impact this anointing we impart this blessing amen hallelujah but never compromising amen we impart the blessings of God we carry it wherever we go but never compromising amen if somebody comes into your office you tell them sorry why are you swearing go wash your filthy mouth and then you'll come back and you speak to me amen suddenly they check themselves because for them it's like normal language protect your anointing amen don't allow others to come and disturb your anointing yes the atmosphere of perfect faith that you're building up don't allow others to come in Satan will come in like that to discourage you let's say one negative word about you and Satan knows your weaknesses your weak spot so you get somebody to come and say something to attack you and bring you down in the flesh yes Satan works from the outside going in so he knows when you attack your flesh and he's just say now they say you're so ugly now you become down in your spirit become down in your spirit and when you're down in your spirit that affects your soul but God works from the inside out God builds you up by faith amen and when they tell you ugly you tell them I'm fearfully and wonderfully made amen amen the Lord says when I was conceived in the innermost Parts amen he knew me and God says I know the plans I have for you amen amen and you tell them amen and maybe an ugly duckling now but he makes all things beautiful in his time so praise the Lord amen yes amen amen amen Hallelujah amen we become carriers of his grace carriers of his anointing carriers of feet in the sower amen people can't understand when you have so much of faith in this hour and you have so much of Revelation in this hour and you can impart so much in this hour to death that they are amazed at it they wonder what kind of person you are amen you become something else to them why you are nearing the Redstone hmm and if you believe you are nearing The Headstone amen amen hallelujah some of you are wondering what Ed

me strength greater is here that is within me than he that is in the world greater is he that is within me then the four horses okay amen oh hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah praise the Lord amen I tell you amen I'm about amen uh sick of this world Amen sick of all this corruption sick of all the nonsense going around amen and also sick of the laziness of the Church of Jesus Christ when we are to be Amen on fire for Jesus we are to be proclaiming the message of the hour amen amen we've got to rise up and God is raising up sons and daughters in this hour amen who lose our shyness amen will stop saying I have no ability you're the one that God can use the one that says they have no ability God is Not Looking for your ability he's looking for your availability yes amen say Lord I'm Available come on let him hear you say Lord I'm Available amen amen let's go to this quote the amen of God Faithful and True Hallelujah we'll try and bring it to a close now with this praise the Lord amen but it's also in the church age book I want you to see something that something that may be found that over people don't have this expectation like when we preach it it sounds foreign to them oh it sounds like expectation is too high the very works of Jesus the very acts of Jesus you want to do that as he is so is she amen so we got there the amen of God faithful and true how many of you want God to reveal himself to you the only time the only way God would reveal himself in this hour is through his prophet yes right so let's follow his his uh teaching here is going to bring us very nicely and we'll get a clear understanding of the message of the hour since Jesus went away till now right the amen of God for faithful and true will reveal himself and it will be by my prophet amen oh yes that is so revelation 10. as in the days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall began to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets there it is he's sending a Vindicated Prophet he's sending a prophet after almost 2 000 years he's sending someone who is so far away from organization education and the world of religion that as John the Baptist and Elijah of old you will hear only from God and he will have thus save the Lord and speak for God amen amen amen yes I have a prophet who has not said the Lord yes my Prophet is William Branham amen I think too many of us don't say that enough amen that's right others want to say they follow bushiri yeah and uh T.B Joshua okay snakes and Austin yes Colgate adverts amen they're proud but I follow them prophet of Malachi 4 5 and 6. Revelation 10 7. amen hallelujah amen you really want to shock people you must tell them they won't know what to say they don't know what to say when you tell them that you silence the enemy amen amen you silence the enemy yes it's coming time for identification so yes that said the Lord and he speaks for God he will be God's mouthpiece And he as it is declared in Malachi 4 5 and 6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul he will restore the truth as they had it and here's what I want to get to and those elect with him are we with him yes amen can I see your hands are you with him amen we got an army here tonight we're going to feel the same here tonight we got a super Army here tonight amen we are with the prophets amen like Joshua and Caleb student Moses we are with our Prophets and those elected him in that day will be the ones or can you imagine speaking back there but we are living in it now yeah amen doesn't it make our hearts grow now we'll be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his what amen and perform his Works amen amen hallelujah amen amen now notice he says that they will manifest the Lord be his body be his voice and perform his words that's God's expectation of us God doesn't have a mute bride yes yes God doesn't have a different damn right yeah this break in here and she can speak yes amen hallelujah and she perform his works so here's a momentary consideration of the church history will prove how accurate this thought is so here's the church history now in a few sentences in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost to the people are you young people here you gotta understand this because sometimes maybe you haven't read the church age book you don't know that people don't have an understanding of the Bible has taken they a seminary teaching and they have taken the college teaching and what one man wrote A Commentary about the Bible and what his opinion is about the scripture so they have substituted the true revelation of the word of God for man-made Creeds dogmas teaching the Catholic church has taken the Bible away from the people and they must listen to their priest only somebody reads for them somebody recites somebody sings Everything the word is taken away from the people we've got to understand that right even you speak to denominational friends they only can quote the blessings and the promises of God that they want and they hate them not the tale and this and that and that yes right the very selective in the scripture but here's the word of God true will it work for anyone who plays it by faith so that's why it works for them but they are selective right so it was lost to the people but God said Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at one time now we don't want to be like these people who speak for God for a certain season yeah and then he stops no no no no no I'm saying this with all humility and please understand what I'm saying If the message church ever leaves God and stops speaking for God then we need to leave them you understand what I'm saying like how God left the lutherans and he moved on yeah because this so-called messaging is not a message thing we are Christians that's who we are we are Christians right but just so that we understand we we say message right God said Luther was the word the Lutheran spoke for God at one time they organized and again the pure word was lost for organization tends towards dogma and Creeds not simple word they no longer they could no longer speak for God so don't think God doesn't have a plan in a program then God sent Wesley he was the voice with the word in his day the people who took his Revelation from God became the living Epistles rated known of all men for their generation when the method has failed God raised up others now he's going to talk about the Pentecostals here you can group all your denominations here so it is gone on through the years until now here we are in our day in this last day there is again another people in the land who under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age yes sir the church was is no longer the mouthpiece of God it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her so let's learn now because remember God is the same if we become our own mouthpiece he will turn on us not the prophet says if God doesn't deal with this generation the same way dealt with Sodom and Gomorrah you must raise them up and apologize yes so God will do the same thing here God is Not respecter of persons if we don't keep his word it will turn on us but now watch God has got a plan and I'm so glad I'm a part of this plan and I know you are too he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her oh my word oh how I've got to protect your anointing Lord because your voice is in me Lord Jesus your voice is in me amen yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation the spirit and the bride say come amen come once more the world will get direct from God as that Pentecost but of course the word bride will be rejected as in the first age Hallelujah one more one more quote there if you can find this amen it says yet it is the average time this is so you know now if it's hours time then everything is ripened yes it's ready to be used right I'll drop this in for you very quickly in Genesis 18 you'll find that Abraham tells Sarah to take fine meal showing you that all this time it passed and that wheat was already crushed and made into flour right so you know what happens in Genesis 18 now you know we're in that chapter right fine flowers so the age of the Elvis time was over have we forget what I'm telling you the Harvest time is over the wheat is ripened yes you can make use of the week now yet it is the average time then there must come upon the scene in this age those who will bring the wheat and the tears to maturity I'm one of them one of them who is this people in this age those will bring the wheat and the tears to maturity God has got a fight for Ministry on the earth Amen to bring the people to maturity amen that's what he's saying here in this age there will be those who bring the wheat and the tears to maturity the tears are already maturing maturing very fast and the corrupt teachers who turn the people from the word but the wheat also must mature yes and to her God is sending the prophet messenger with a Vindicated Ministry that he might be accepted by the elect amen not by the non-elect they will hear him as the first church heard Paul and she will mature in the word until becoming a word bride yeah again now I'm not saying all of this the mighty what will be found in her as you know that I always attended upon the pure word and Faith amen we are living now in the time we watch his faith expressed yes we can't be saying we have faith faith faith faith but no words no Life of Christ no evidence of it amen but I'm so glad amen that we can be identified to be the final voice of the final age now remember what we said you have a responsibility let your light so shine before men you may be thinking I'm young I am I'm still got enough time I don't need no be on fire for God now give God the best days of your life serve God now while you can the world has nothing to offer you amen the world has nothing to offer you you get so excited to watch a two-hour movie one hour movie

much in store for us and I feel like he's really driving us now he's really pushing us to the finish line and he's saying come on fly fly start moving amen stop moving I have a desire for the things of God Amen I'm sure we can all lose a few hours sleep here in the night and pray and show him and we can sacrifice our time amen I'm sure amen we should be enthused about the things of God Hallelujah

honest now you are not the same person that you entered this year you are not the same person that you enter 23 2023 you are a different being something has happened to you amen and if something has not happened to you I'm praying right now that the angel of God will come and touch you with a cold from the altar and you can recognize Who You Are amen let's stand together let's give the Lord a good income of praise hallelujah praise the Lord praise the Lord amen when the Caleb have finally got to this message he knows weeks ago he's asking me what was my title and I said I'm trying to speak

they get upset when somebody doesn't make them in charge of something and doesn't give them a position and doesn't give them but look at God he says yes I've chosen you I've chosen you amen hallelujah
