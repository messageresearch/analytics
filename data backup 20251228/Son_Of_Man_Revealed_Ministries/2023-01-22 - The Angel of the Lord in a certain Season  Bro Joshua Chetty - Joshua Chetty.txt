========================================

foreign [Music] amen living in a time where you can see that any longer will be burned up like an oven yeah so we can see the days an earring or departure and while we are here there's a work for us to do because God has put us here for a purpose amen amen and until we find ourselves in his purpose then no matter what we pray for no matter what we ask you we're not asking in line with his word yes we must connect to his purpose amen for our lives you may have heard your Bible this morning we're going to turn to them book of ecclesiastics chapter Ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1. 50 to everything there is a season and a time to every purpose under the heaven amen amen so we know that God works in time then season we know a season is a space of time if it was a winter season now you prepare for the winter season if it's a summer season you're cooling you're getting things to pull off prepare for the summer season if it's talking to the spring season you'll have preparation for the spring season so you've got to recognize the season that you're living in amen we'll also turn to the book of Zechariah chapter 4 verse 1. and the angel of God that talked to me came again and wake me as a man that waked out of his sleep and said unto me what she is down and I said I have looked and be holy Candlestick all of gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps there on and seven pipes to the seven left which are upon the top thereof and two olive trees by one the right side of the bowl and the other on the left side they're off so accidents spoke to the angels that talked with me saying what are these my Lord an angel that talked with me answered and said unto my nose thou not what these be and I said no my Lord that he said and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord until people saying not by might know by power but by my spirit amen saved the Lord of hosts amen who are thou great Mountain before zero people that I should become shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the eighth Stone thereof with shouting crying Grace Grace unto hits imagine maybe she did so we take that one part he says not by Minds not by power but by my spirit saved the Lord amen amen this morning we're going to speak on the topic the angel of the Lord in a certain season amen and not by another subtropical saying not by mites not by power but by my spirits says the Lord amen amen the angel of the Lord in a certain season and let's look at the scripture to put that in context John chapter 5 verse 1 to 9. John chapter 5 Saint John chapter 5 verse 1 to 9. and after this there was a feast of the Jews and Jesus went up to Jerusalem that there is at Jerusalem by the Sheep Margaret pool which is calling the Hebrew tongue but isda having five porches in these lay great multitude of important folk of blind or witted waiting for the moving of the water that was something like how you go wait like at a clinic or at a hospital but this is now they are relying upon God here now for an angel went down at a certain season into the pool and Trouble the water whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease he had so the water was there all the time but it wasn't a certain season that the angel of God will step in amen and when you trouble the water whoever stepped in the hill so whatever disease they had so basically dare to wait there efficiently and wait for that season amen yes amen and the fact they were waiting there they had Faith to believe amen they are fit to believe that in a Southern Season the angel of God is going to step forth into the water yes yes and he's gonna trouble the water they couldn't just be seated there without faith to believe in that the fact that they came there and they waited because it wasn't just just coming there and they're getting here going into the water no the angel of the of the Lord had to step in first travel the water and then they were healed and a certain man was there which had an uniformity 30 and eight years when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said unto him now who is Jesus the Same Angel of the Lord that was stepping in now God doesn't change his word but he changes his form in the human flesh now because he knew that he he was it was him in another form who is the Angel of the lord we made it very clear in our past sermon it's God himself he's not a created angel amen this is God himself changing his form amen same God the pull of fire same color of fire materialized to come into a man yes one time they come at a star in 1933 and the river when the prophet was baptizing one time you come at the pool of fire the same mother let the children of Israel one time he come in the form of a cloud and here he is now in human flesh but he knew he could discern this man yeah he had his infirmity for a long time but he knew that this man had faith because he was there waiting for the angel to trouble the water amen amen now you know if you wanna how many of you you know you trusting God for something and you want it to just happen but yeah with the people they were patients yes amen the other one that the angel of God comes to this place at a certain time and a certain season the other the preaching of the word amen Faith cometh by hearing and hearing of the world Amen so they heard the word yeah we've had the word amen yes we've been hearing the preaching of the words and our faith must turn within us amen what made us to come into this world we have faith to believe it amen if without faith it is impossible to serve God Amen that's what brings us into the message of the hour we heard these things we have the supernatural and we knew that this this is a message that will take us out of this Earth amen this is a message of Deliverance this is a message that will give us a body change amen and we came in and we began to wait patiently yes because we don't move until you tell that to move we said be it unto me according to Thy word Lord but at a certain time in a certain season they materialize us now in human flesh amen amen you stepped on the scene and here's the man with 1814 now 38 years of his life he had an infirmity but now this day is going to be different from every other day amen this season is going to be different from every other season that you've been waiting yes you always was believing amen amen the fact that you're here you've always been believing but this is gonna be a different season amen this is gonna be a season where Something's Gonna materialize Something's Gonna Take Place amen that what he believed within him amen that coming upon his heart is now going to materialize in his flesh amen there's coming in our way in your flesh you will see God Amen he's coming now in your flesh you're gonna see the supernatural right here in this natural you're going to see the supernatural because why the things that you have believed now are going to become practical in your life and he said when Jesus saw him lie I knew that he had now been a long time in the case he said unto him will thou be made whole amen don't we want to be made whole amen I'm talking about making all taking a lot of those personals I'm talking about a message that come to deliver us out of the pest house yes amen I'm talking about a problem that was commissioned just like Moses where God sent an angel before him amen amen he gave the two signs I'm talking about when God came in to pull out fire with Moses Moses so was he with His prophets amen amen right amen and we've got and now the prophet has given us a message and he goes up the scene but the person that's still not Leading the People is the Angel of the Lord amen right here amongst us thank you Lord one of the messages have been waking us too to become sensitive to his presence Amen to become sensitive in the season that he's working in yes amen amen because it comes in a certain season amen and when he comes Moses remember Moses now was brought up in Pharaoh's Hearts because his parents knew that he was a proper child yes and knew he was born a prophet he was born for a purpose God and eventually his own mother his real identity is amen but he was cool with all the signs with all the education with all the intellect he had the best schooling in Egypt God had to take the 40 Years of his life yes amen but when he come in that 40 Years of his life towards the end of the before he leaves Egypt now he realized hey there's a purpose for me now to be a deliverer now his mother is taught him that didn't even be being taught on that you've got the word we've been teaching we've got the Bible we got the scriptures we've been taught who we are and what amen what our place is but it wasn't good enough he had to meet the pull of fire amen he had to have in the back of the devil experience yes and he hasn't asked that as yet he's been thoughts and he's been reading he's been learning but he hasn't had that personal experience he has to come a time where you must have the personal encounter amen it's a one-on-one experience amen you mean taught that word from the time the message has been preached year after year after year but a couple of time in your life where you must have a prosperity we find that he tried one day you saw an Egyptian fighting with a and what he did kill the Egyptian he buried him in the sand thought it's forgotten he tried to do it with his own strengths yes with his own might amen because he was remember he was brought up in the pharaoh's house so you must have been learning all these skills and kill that man are you talking about the concealings Kentucky is delivering the people and the next day some Israelites we engage in some in some quarrel and they were fighting and you tried to intervene and they revealed to him what he thought nobody saw yes that he murdered a man and then he had to flee Egypt right because he couldn't deliver the people he needed to meet the angel of the Lord man he needed the angel of the Lord to go before him because he's the angel of the Lord that will take the people on Exodus amen it will be the angel of the Lord it will bring forth the plague yes it will bring it will be the angel of the Lord that will turn his tough into his serpents it'll be the end of the Lord and apart the Red Sea amen he was going to do the works but Moses had to go and meet him amen so you can see not by mites not by power but by my spirit says the Lord amen Moses couldn't deliver the people with his might with his power amen he needed something more so he said the important man answered himself I have no man when the water is troubled to put me into the pool but while I am coming another step put down before me Jesus said unto him rise take up thy bed and walk and immediately the man was made holy and took up his bed and walked amen amen so he made it patiently waiting for the Time of the Season yes and in that certain season God was manifested in flesh of course watch one time the disciples were there on the boats Luke chapter five was a bunch of nine and he came to pass that as the people pressed upon him to hear the word of God he stood by the lake of guinnesserit and saw two ships standing by the lake by the fish by the fishermen were gone out of them and we're fishing washing their nails and he entered into one of the ships which were Simons and prayed him that he would trust out a little from the land and he sat down and taught the people out of the ship now when he had left speaking he said unto Simon launched out into the deep and let down let down your nets for a drop and Simon for the drawer and Simon answering synonym to him Master we have toiled all the nights and have taken nothing doesn't do this by their own rights by their own strengths but their own abilities by being seasoned fishermen their toys yeah yeah just because trying to sort of our own issues out we might have our own circumstances we try in the flesh to help ourselves instead of going and laying in other sweets asking God to lead us into a situation sometimes we go and use our kind of thinking and we want to do things on our own abilities and we find that it's just a failure but [Music] and I'm taking nothing he said buddy listen to what Peter said nevertheless at Thy Word I will let down the nips amen so he has obedience to the word now amen as thy word I will let down thyness and when they had done this they enclosed a great multitude of fishes and their net break here's God bringing for His blessings down amen that they can't contain this blessing then the net break yeah and they're beginner to the partners which were in the other ship that they should come and help them and they came and filled both the ships so that they both began to sink look at when God's not blessing now when he poured out his Blessing you won't be able to contain it amen and you are not doing it alone now you are sharing your blessing with others you're calling others come the Lord is Blessing Me This is the time this is the season I'm not talking about just physical things now I'm talking about your spiritual blessing amen I'm talking about when you're rejoicing in this word and rejoicing in this time of this word Revival now and all these great things are happening you don't want to so much the Lord is Blessing you become astonished you won't be able to contain the way he's blessing you amen yes and you want to bring others income see what the Lord is doing here see what the Lord is revealing to us week after week see how the opening of the word is coming through and get the secret Simon Peter saw it he fell down at Jesus knees saying depart from me from a sinful Man O Lord listen to this for he was astonished and all that we are with him and the drought of the fishes which they had taken hmm foreign repentance amen because you can't be in the presence of God and the Lord is revealing things and the Supernatural is taking place and you not began to see that you now need to surrender your life amen you become sensitive to his presence right there when Peter saw the supernatural taking place he began to become sensitive Jesus presence yes and when he began when he became sensitive he realized oh I am a sinful man you see that is why the presence of God yes yeah you come here with all your thoughts and feelings but you cannot go live in the same amen because you will come to realize that Lord I am nothing without you yes amen yes oh Lord I Need Your Grace upon my life thank you the prophet of God says when Israel left Egypt for the promised land in Exodus 13 1 God know that they never traveled that way before either 40 miles but yet they needed something to go with them they lose their weight so God sent them a guide yes something like this I send my angel before you they pull out of fire to keep you in the way to guide them to this promised land and the turn of Israel followed that guy the pillar of Fire by night and Cloud by day when it stops day stops when he journeyed their Journey amen and when he got them close to the land and there wasn't afoot to go over he led them back into the Wilderness again you wouldn't go with them you see when you find that you're not ready but you're not foot and he's not going to work with you he'll leave you there till you come back to repentance again to the surrender your life again and then he moves again he wants a surrendered life amen we cannot be living going to the promised land which is the Holy Ghost and all our inheritance and we're walking in this walk and then we're looking back to legacia you cannot have one leg in Leticia you cannot come into this word rumbling after drumming and murmuring because that is the chest that is the truth yes when the seconds when your finances are low what do you got problems at all when you got difficult that is the chest of a true Christian the kind of nature comes out or you're going to say Lord You Lead Me Lord I cannot make it Lord I need you yes Lord may you be my guide amen that's what he wants he wants to be your guy amen the Lord knows that you cannot go on this walk to the promised land on your own yes that's why he sent you the guide amen that's what we have the angel of the Lord guiding us for not a different person the same God changing his form amen don't make our God into different people God God you've got to understand God in the season that he's working in amen amen you've got to see God in a season that he's working in that is where they missed Jesus when he came on the scene yes they missed him in the season that he was in they knew him to put out fire they knew him in the way he walked in Moses but they didn't see him when he was manifested in the flesh yes it's the same thing we can say today we know him working in the days of the prophets we know him in the Supernatural of the prophet but do you recognize him in your own life amen do you recognize you're sensitive to his leading yes for him to be a guide to you you've got to be sensitive to his leading amen and he will lead you into all Church he will lead you into every part of your life but you gotta you gotta take that step and say Lord not my will be done father but your will be done amen stop using your own ability because he said not by Max you might be applying for a job that might seem impossible for you to get maybe your company informed you that because of the employment the equity act you don't fit the cuts maybe your company informed you that you do not have enough experience as yet but if you really desire that job and if you really want it and you are really faithful to God Amen you say Lord not my mind not by might not by power because promotion doesn't come from man Lord you put Kings in places you put people in positions yes all authority comes from you Lord not by power but by my spirit says the Lord amen you might say Lord I'm trusting I need a wife but Lord are you interested in finding me a partner is that something that you do go back to the Bible who was the one that first again the first marriage in the Garden of Eden who was the one that was leading Elijah to find a bride for Isaac amen was he not interested in marriages who are the one who was the angel of the Lord because Abraham knew that he met his Angel and he knew that he's gonna entrust really either to go because he's being led by the angel of the Lord and he was the one interested in fact in taking in leading him the way was it not the angel of the Lord that directed The Prophet that he was married at a certain date yes amen who is the eye Beyond I send you amen amen he's the same I am it's the same great I am yes yes what does scripture not given to you be all right send you Elijah the prophet amen God is interested in all was he not little interested in a little fishy in that little dead fish with the hook taking out all his God was interested in the fish would God not be interested in you then the Bible says if he cares for the sparrow of the air if he cares for the Lilies of the Field how much more will he do for you so why take daughter what what food you're going to eat what clothes you're gonna wear don't be troubled by these things he said to them I send my angel before you the pillar of fire to keep you in the way to guide you to guide them to the strongest land and the children of Israel follow that guide the pull of Fire with it he said that's what it is the church today no doubt but what the long-suffering of God today as it was in the days of Noah the church would have been would have done been gone if it had just corrected and said in order but it has to lead around lead us around and around and around middle of Israel know when they were shouting on seeing the dead soldiers of Egypt they drowned us pharaohs carried and turned upside down they got their victory Moses in the spirit singing in the spirit Mary Miriam dancing in the spirit and the daughters of Israel running up and down the bank shouting and dancing they were they were only a few days from milk and honey little did they know it was 40 years away because they begin to Grumble again God and guide [Music] another code disease and we without a leader are helpless and Christ is our leader and God was with Moses leader though he sent him an angel to lead him I said my angel who for thee to keep thee in the way and to bring thee to the place which I have promised the angel wants to be his leader listen to what he said the angel performed the Miracles Moses never performed any miracles the angel of God in Moses performed the Miracles amen the angel of God in brother Branham performed the Miracles you see what I mean you are the same angel of God that discerned the Hearts and Thoughts of the people amen you've got we got to see that amen yes amen the angel of the Lord was with him the angel of the Lord led him perform Let Them perform the Miracles that is why if you want to see the Miracles again if you want to see God giving you discernment to know your situation because you have to have spiritual discernment is our knowing right and wrong then you have to understand who is leading in this hour amen amen you have to understand the same one that read the prophets he's here on the scene amen now God has always by all men through the scriptures through all ages has ordained that Angels should guide the people there was Moses it was Daniel oh and many more we could we say all the way down someone was speaking to me not long ago said but brother not he said not after the Holy Ghost has come No Angels guide the church or guide individuals Nosa said it's the holy ghost that guide them that's misunderstanding between angels and the Holy Ghost amen that is error see just pass it out the denomination of teaching or the church we are teaching they don't understand that this is not an ordinary Angel yes amen this is not a created angel this is God himself the Holy Ghost he's God amen amen and the angel of the Lord is the Holy Ghost and that is why they could have the gifts but they could not accept the Holy Ghost and therefore that is why he was not led by the Holy Ghost amen they were led by the system of man but he was not led by the Holy Ghost and it's the holy ghost that birth in the church it's the holy ghost that led the church and it's the only God that is still leading the church amen man he says the Angels left the church right on and still leading the church correctly amen how many would say that Philip had the Holy Ghost [Music] said let's see your hand he said how many things full about the Holy Ghost the Apostle Philip surely see all right he did didn't he who was it spoke to him down there at Samaria and told him to go to the desert Gaza an angel amen did he have the Holy Ghost sure he did amen how many things that Peter the Apostle had the holy ghost that preached the inauguration sermon for the church the day of Pentecost well when he was laying in prison up there who was it come to and touched him and brought him outside the angel is that right amen how many says sin Paul the Apostle had the Holy Ghost he says lift your hand when the ship was tossed about for 14 days and there's no hopes at all and he could and he come out there and shook his hand and holding I guess glory to God be of good cheer the angel of the Lord whose servant I am stood by me last night in that right how many believe John the Revelator and the Holy Ghost the whole book of Revelation was shown to him by an Angel amen that's right and they had the Holy Ghost friends the angel is not a worship of Angel it's God sending his ministering spirit in the church to minister to the people amen there's no flesh and Glory before God if anybody could have Glory it would be Jesus but he said it's not me that the works it's my father that dwelled in me that doeth the worst amen amen so you see how important it is to be sensitive to the season that we're living in now yes there was a seasoning for the opening of the word there was a season to get the people cleaned up there was a season to lay down doctrines amen but now there's a season where you must follow the guide amen you must be sensitive to the leading of the guides because now is the hour when he wants to move you must move amen the children of Israel before they go into battle even with the time when they went to Jericho Joshua was out there and he was going they are the Arctic but they are the angel Lord going before them we have the word the message of the hour amen the seven Thunders come in this day to come what to give us rapturing Faith amen we have the word now but we have the angel of God going before us yes and he is the one that's making this world more clear yes he's the one that's going to break every wall every barrier every that will keep your headbound amen going and is defeating the amorites the invite the parasites the Japanese size all the things that will keep you at bounds man all the things that will trap you and not keep make you look towards Heavenly things yeah because he's come to reveal to you and unseen words amen amen amen amen we come to reveal to you another dimension you come to reveal to you a different identity that you deep within you there's a gene of God and that is a different species that's from a fake specie come to reveal to you that you come from the Royal seat of Abraham that you are the fake seed and all the blessing of every every blessing and alongs every Abraham's Journey you must experience the same thing amen Abraham at blessing did he not everyone was blessed yes you must have those blessings amen Abraham interceded for his loved one yes you must do the same because you must be convincing this hour that judgment is coming upon the Earth amen did he not reveal to Abraham the secret before he burned destroy Sodom and tomorrow did he not reveal that to Abraham did he not reveal to us what he's going to do to result amen he says we were not a leader are helpless God wanted Moses together amen he speaks about him in all ages amen aren't you thanking God amen amen when you left whatever system you belong to when you left Egypt amen did you come here and you receive this word who is leading you here yes maybe you couldn't see it then you didn't understand it you were thinking all you know is that I'm here there's something I believe there's something that's being preacher that I believe yes I believe in the church but it was the angel of the Lord amen was leading you here because and this Prophet was sent out Jesus for Christ an angel of the Lord was leaving you and not only did he worked with him leading him to Rebecca he also was working with Rebecca amen amen they also had to be an unction within Rebecca amen they also had to be something a deep calling with a d with a deep according to the Deep from within you amen you have to be something within you to receive it to respond to the call because no matter how much we come and interpret the word to you if there wasn't a gene of God within you if there wasn't a representation you would not receive it amen God has to give you the faith to believe it that's the grace of God yes you have to be predestinated for that in terms of the Book of Judges [Music] watch out is working in all circumstances Judges chapter 6 verse 1. and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them in the hand of the million seven years and the Hand of Midian prevailed against Israel because of all the midianites the children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds and so it was when Israel had sown that the majinats came up and the amalekites and the children of the East even they came up against them so yeah the children of Israel now because of their sin because they first look God and they did evil in the sight of God yeah now the enemy is coming upon them and when the enemy comes he comes he comes with others amen right he comes like a flood against you and then count against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till Thou come unto Gaza and left no sustenance for Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor Earth so they came up with their Kettle and the tent and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both day and the camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord now this is something about a child of God the children of God he was in your sin it was in your problem he was in a vaccinating condition but when they cry unto the Lord even in the vaccine condition God must hear your cry if you're a child of God God will answer your prayer amen and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the Monday nights that's why sometimes when the passing the vaccine condition God puts them in the problem until it brings them onto their knees to cry out to him amen and say Lord I have forsook you Lord I have forsook your words Lord I have not been faithful to the to coming to church to the fellowship I have not been Faithfully in praying I have not been in favor of reading my Bible I have not been faithful in serving you Lord and then a problem comes sickness come and ailment come and infirmity comes and what happened it brings you on your knees but it's not the end of the world if you're a child of God cry out to God Amen says and it came to pass with the children of his great prayer unto the Lord because of the midnight that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel would sit unto them just say the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the other bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptian and out of the end of all that oppressed you and drained them out from before you and gave you their lands see they give you their land right and I said unto you I am the Lord your God fear not the god of the amorites he knows landed well but you have not obeyed my voice and they came an angel of the Lord and said under an oak which was in Opera that the chain and the Jewish that be the right and his son give you interest Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the merchandise and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee the Mighty Man of Valor amen who is this that deserve his heart who is this that can discern who this person is oh my Lord if the Lord be with us why then he's always befallen us and where is and where be all these Miracles which our father told us where be all the Miracles that we heard of in the bread of the day amen where Beyond The Miracles in God be with us man but in the time in season yeah the angel of the Lord he's coming now to work with him Amen in a certain season now the angel of the Lord is coming to deliver it he's coming with Deliverance amen and Gideon my Lord did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord had forsaken us and delivered us into the hand of the midianites so we tried to say that becoming a message so long in the Lord wasn't doing anything the Lord had forsaken us he was there so many years ago when the prophet all these things took place but look listen to the beginning of the scripture in the beginning says that they was the one the first of the Lord they did evil in the sight of the Lord yes amen and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shall save Israel from the hell of the midianites have not I said thee and he said unto him oh my Lord where would shall I save Israel beyond my family is poor in medicine and I am the least in my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee so you're not good God is Not depending upon him yeah right amen he said I will be with him amen surely I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the midianite as one man amen you think you're going and defeating your battle on your own do you think you're facing your circumstance on your own and you feel that you cannot do it recognize the season yes and he's a great I am because here amongst you it's as great I am that is leading you amen it's the angel of the Lord and he's going before you amen you're not going into your space in your situation alone you're not going and facing the circumstance alone amen you're not living in this hour of Leticia in his Darkest Hour you're not living it alone it's the angel of God that guy that is leading us yes amen in his Darkest Hour in this most gruesome hour to live upon in his most difficult age to live upon it is the guide that is leading us amen and the Lord said unto him surely I will be with thee and thou shalt Smite the imagination one man and he said unto him if now I have found Grace in thy sight then show me a sign with me your partnered ends I pray thee until I come unto thee and bring forth my present and set it before thee and he said I will carry and doubt until Thou come again and Gideon went in and made really a kid and unleavened case of ever a flower the flesh he put in a basket and he put the broth in a pot and brought it out under him the organ presented it and the angel of God sent unto him take the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and lay them Upon This Rock and pour the brunt and he did so then the angel of the Lord put for the end of the stuff that was in his hand and touched the Flesh and the unleavened cakes and they rolled up fire out of the Rock and consumed the Flesh and then leaving cakes then the angel of the Lord departed out of his sights and Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the Lord Gideon said I left oh Lord God for because I have seen an angel of the Lord face to face and the Lord said unto him peace be unto thee fear not thou shall not die because you know the scripture if anyone knows that when you see God they shall die we knew that in the days of Moses that he couldn't go to the mountain he had to make Moses go and speak for them I said fear not thou shall not die in Gideon building altar there before the Lord and calling Jehovah Shalom amen amen and we have received the message alone in this day amen amen in the days of gross Darkness and says arise and shine that light has come amen amen you can see foreign by causing the fire to come and consuming the Flesh and the unleavened cakes amen chapter judges 13. and you know the story here this goes on Gideon God brought him down to he took years initially started the army of ten thousand men and he brought down the amount of footage that he would use because he wanted to show him not the hand of man but it's God himself that's going to deliver them amen because it's not about might not by power but by by spirit says the Lord amen judges 13. and watch every time the angel of the Lord is coming watch when he's coming and the children of Israel did Evil again in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the land of the Philistines 40 years and there was a certain man of zorah of the family of the day night whose name was Manoa and his wife was Barren in bayonets and the angel of the Lord appeared unto the woman not but thou shall conceive and bear his son not therefore beware of breathing and drink not wine no strong drink and eat not any unclean thing follow Thou shalt conceive and be a son and no razor shall come on his head for the child shall be a Nazarite God from the womb and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the land of the Philistines then the woman came and told her husband saying amen of God came unto me and his countenance was like the continents of an angel of God very terrible but I asked him not when he was neither neither told him me his name but he said unto me be all thou shall conceive and bear his son and now drink no wine no strong drink no neither eat any unclean thing but the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the whole to this to the day of his death so you see before this happened now before the angel of God could work is warning here to now have not to drink any strong drink nor to drink any wine if you want the supernatural to take place in your life you need to separate yourself from unclean living you need to separate yourself from the things of the flesh amen from the thing that will destroy the flesh yes the thing that will be contrary to the spirit man you need to separate yourself from those things because if you want the angel of God to work amongst you then we need to now have a surrendered life amen to become a prisoner to Christ see that I that liveth by Christ that delivered in me yes amen amen I am surrendered to him amen amen to his world and then he can come and work amen then the woman came and told her husband remember I treated the Lord and said oh Lord let the man of God is doubted his sin come again unto us and teach us what we shall do unto the child and and through the child that shall be born and God welcome to the voice of Manoa and the angel of God came again unto the woman that she set in the field but Manoa husband and the woman made Ace and Grand and showed a husband and said unto him behold the man had appeared unto me that came unto me the other day and Manoa arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said unto him as thou the man that speaketh unto the woman and he said and he said I am and Manoa said now let thy words come to pass how shall we order the child and how shall we do unto him in other words they're becoming you want to be obedient out of the world Amen and the age of the Lord said unto him Manoa of all that are said unto the woman let her beware she may not eat of anything the common of the wine neither let her drink wine or strong drink no any unclean thing all that I commanded her let her observe foreign [Music] offering thou must offer it unto the Lord knew not that he was an angel of the Lord and Manoa said unto the angel of the Lord what is the name that when the things come to pass we may we may do the honor and the angel of the Lord said unto him why ask us after my name seeing it is a CPT secrets amen this is it wasn't revealed to everybody amen so manova took a kid with a meat offering and offered it upon a rock unto the Lord and the law Angel did wondrously and Manoa and his wife looked on so he came to pass when the flame went up toward Heaven from off the altar that the angel of the Lord ascended into the flame of the Altar and when Noah and his wife looked on it and fell on their faces to the ground but the angel of the Lord did not did no more appear to Manoa unto his wife knew he was the angel of the Lord amen he came give him the word dare to be obedient to the word you come again and worked through Samson because every time Samson he is in battle he's not Samson yes the angel of God walking through something amen amen and that's why when Samson now fell into sin God couldn't work with him the angel of God couldn't come and work with him until Samson had to come to a time of repentance and said once more Lord amen amen he had to come now to a time of repentance and according to the word that was spoken that the loss will be there was grown now and he was truly repented now and now he cries out one small Lord yes then he comes and works again amen then he comes and strengthens him yes amen you might have found yourself in a need this morning you might have found yourself in a circumstance this morning maybe it's time to evaluate yourself maybe each one of us to do a self-evaluation if you want the angel of God to work in our lives if we want to see the supernatural manifested in and so our lives amen we want to see Miracles taking place and it's time to inspect our own lives amen and say Lord let me surrender myself to you oh Lord I shine on my own abilities I try to make money by trying to get some extra

further teaching uh you know a degree and whatever she wants to do so we prayed about it and we said when schools reopen you go back and you remind the teacher to read them to the application but it so happened we didn't need to do that because in the engine room we've been preaching in people with vision and we've been preaching about the Leaning of the angel of God so all we did was to learn it to God and we believe that all things are possible so here comes January the teachers get back to school they call her back and say come in for an interview amen so from a no you are unsuccessful to
